10001	Schrodinger's Maze	In front of you is an unknown region shrouded by black mist. Neither the terrain radar nor the scanning sensor could detect any information. Forces were deployed to explore the region, but each time they came back with a different map, as if the maze could alter its form based on the explorers. Stepping inside is the only way to learn more about it.	Enter	4		5		6	
10002	Theseus' Maze	In front of you is an unknown region shrouded by black mist. The terrain radar and the scanning sensor give largely different results. Perhaps a construction Construct has been modifying its structure, or maybe a terrain-changing function is built within.	Enter	7		8		9	
10003	Ignosticism Maze	In front of you is an unknown region shrouded by black mist. The terrain radar and the scanning sensor have returned some information, but according to the exploration forces previously deployed, the shortest paths marked on the map usually led to a dead end.	Enter	10		11
