102100101	100001	Cherries are a subgroup of plants in the Rose family. Historically known as the "Tokyo Cherry" or "Japanese Blossom", I have never seen one in real life, but I have seen their photos in books.	2000
102100102	100001	That person is the first human to make me feel special, to make me want to... touch—I don't know if these thoughts should exist.	3000
102100103	100001	Please look forward to my performance.	4000
102100104	100001	Humans fall ill without consistent nutritional intake. Please strive for a healthy diet, Commandant.	5000
102100105	100001	Gray Raven will remain on standby at HQ until we receive your orders.	6000
102100106	100001	Lucia at your service.	2000
102100107	100001	Commandant. Should we do something if you're free...?	3000
102100108	100001	Humans can experience fatigue, unlike Constructs. Make sure you get enough rest.	4000
102100109	100001	Are human relationships anything like ours?	5000
102100110	100001	Just staying like this is fine too. Just the two of us...	6000
102100201	100001	Are you busy, Commandant?	2000
102100202	100001	I was thinking about you when you were away.	3000
102100203	100001	The warrior's blade is not bound by the scabbard but by the soul of its wielder. Warriors may be a thing in the past, but their spirit never dies...	4000
102100204	100001	Gray Raven leader, Lucia. Nice to meet you, Commandant.	5000
102100205	100001	I am your blade. Do not hesitate to use me.	6000
102100206	100001	Good to see you again, Commandant.	2000
102100207	100001	Hmm... We've been seeing a lot of each other lately.	3000
102100208	100001	I feel like something's changing in my M.I.N.D...	4000
102100209	100001	I'm content right now.	5000
102100210	100001	I hold no fear for the future as long as you're here.	6000
102100301	100001	Nose to the grindstone, Commandant.	2000
102100302	100001	Don't worry. l won't cause you trouble.	3000
102100303	100001	The battlefield will always be my home.	4000
102100304	100001	Trouble sleeping? May as well keep fighting then.	5000
102100305	100001	You put a brave face on things far more than me, don't you?	6000
102100306	100001	...You're getting a bit too close.	2000
102100307	100001	Only because it's you.	3000
102100308	100001	This feeling... It has a power that could encompass everything.	4000
102100309	100001	Don't worry. I'll protect you.	5000
102100310	100001	You give me the courage to face the darkness.	6000
103100101	100001	My memory is very short. I don't know when I'll be rebooted, or even if I'll remember you.	2000
103100102	100001	Don't worry about us. It is you who gives us strength.	3000
103100103	100001	I'll keep trying.	4000
103100104	100001	Please get some rest. I'll help Lucia protect the base.	5000
103100105	100001	If you've got any questions about HQ, please feel free to ask me.	6000
103100106	100001	Lee has provided me with stats for your last battle. Please take a look.	2000
103100107	100001	I may not fight as well as the others, but I'll always try my best!	3000
103100108	100001	Sorry for troubling you again today. But if I can help at all, it would be my pleasure.	4000
103100109	100001	Lucia is a powerful Construct, and you... are a powerful human.	5000
103100110	100001	I wonder what it was like when humans still roamed the Earth?	6000
103100201	100001	Have you been staying up late reading again? I already warned you about that.	2000
103100202	100001	Commandant... My name is Liv... I'll try to be of help.	3000
103100203	100001	Don't worry, I'm here. I may not be able to hold my own, but I'll try my best to do so.	4000
103100204	100001	I might not be as good as Lucia, but I'll try to catch up.	5000
103100205	100001	Lee keeps looking over at me... Have I done something wrong...?	6000
103100206	100001	There's a lot of things about you that I'd like to study closer.	2000
103100207	100001	Welcome back! Let's all do our best today.	3000
103100208	100001	I find your voice very reassuring.	4000
103100209	100001	I-if it's possible, I'd love to watch the sunset and sunrise with you one day.	5000
103100210	100001	If it's you, I think I don't mind being a bit closer.	6000
103100301	100001	I wonder what it was like when humans still roamed the Earth?	2000
103100302	100001	A new day is dawning, Commandant.	3000
103100303	100001	Would today's operation planning require my help?	4000
103100304	100001	I am no longer alive. What fear does death hold for me?	5000
103100305	100001	I could never hate you.	6000
103100306	100001	Do not fear to be in the darkness, for I shall lead you forward.	2000
103100307	100001	As long as you're here, I am content.	3000
103100308	100001	Have you run into trouble?	4000
103100309	100001	(I like you...)	5000
103100310	100001	I can never know too much about you.	6000
101100101	100001	Life is nothing but a series of cycles.	2000
101100102	100001	Humans want to know the future but cannot predict it. Sometimes I wonder if Constructs were made to satisfy the human need for a future.	3000
101100103	100001	So you're the Commandant, huh... Just don't do anything stupid.	4000
101100104	100001	I'm not just your average data jockey. I can fight as well.	5000
101100105	100001	Good choice.	6000
101100106	100001	Apparently, humans without enough rest at night have a higher rate of hair loss.	2000
101100107	100001	Rest is optional for Constructs.	3000
101100108	100001	Don't worry too much about us. You're much more important.	4000
101100109	100001	I can't complain. You're easier to deal with than the last Commandant.	5000
101100110	100001	Okay, okay. "We're getting along." I get it.	6000
101100201	100001	Get some rest, or you won't last 'til the afternoon operations.	2000
101100202	100001	Nothing.	3000
101100203	100001	Not bad. I feel like I'll grow stronger.	4000
101100204	100001	Idle hands are the devil's workshop, Commandant.	5000
101100205	100001	I ran some tests on the Corrupted yesterday. I'll show you later.	6000
101100206	100001	Aren't these... tricks what you perform on humans? Why are you using it all on me...?	2000
101100207	100001	I might go a bit easier on you if you manage to survive the next battle.	3000
101100208	100001	Staying in this squad was the best decision I've ever made.	4000
101100209	100001	There you are! Let us begin by analyzing those Corrupted samples we collected yesterday.	5000
101100210	100001	You look like you can handle yourself in a fight.	6000
101100301	100001	...What are you looking at?	2000
101100302	100001	Strategy and tactics are two different things... Not that you'd understand.	3000
101100303	100001	If you find yourself with a lot of spare time, you should maybe do some brain exercises.	4000
101100304	100001	Commandants shouldn't just be sitting around all day, right?	5000
101100305	100001	Your work is tiring, Commandant. Let me know if you don't feel well.	6000
101100306	100001	Tell me if you run into any trouble. Don't just keep it all in yourself.	2000
101100307	100001	I didn't say I dislike it.	3000
101100308	100001	So we're getting to know each other, huh.	4000
101100309	100001	I remember everything you say. Orders, and everything else.	5000
101100310	100001	Don't worry. I'll protect you.	6000
104100101	100001	Having no emotions is good. That way you will never betray someone, nor experience betrayal.	2000
104100102	100001	I will never betray.	3000
104100103	100001	Might is needed to fulfill your wishes.	4000
104100104	100001	God bless...	5000
104100105	100001	Faith? It all came naturally, please don't mind me.	6000
104100106	100001	I trust you completely, Commandant.	2000
104100107	100001	Practice makes perfect. The same goes for all skills.	3000
104100108	100001	I do my duty, because that's what I believe in.	4000
104100109	100001	No more goofing off when we're together, okay?	5000
104100110	100001	I'm given a more mature disposition than the other girls on the team... What do you think of it, Commandant...?	6000
104100301	100001	I believe in you, Commandant.	2000
104100302	100001	I hope we can fight together, at the very least.	3000
104100303	100001	Preparations are complete. You can begin working whenever you like.	4000
104100304	100001	I will follow all your commands.	5000
104100305	100001	Indeed, we get along quite well.	6000
104100306	100001	You should rest if you're tired, but please don't slack off during work.	2000
104100307	100001	I'm a believer, but my faith isn't blind—that's why I protect you.	3000
104100308	100001	Constructs can't truly have faith? Or are you trying to be my target of worship?	4000
104100309	100001	The power of faith cannot be denied—just like the power you give me.	5000
104100310	100001	Because of you, battle now has meaning for me.	6000
105100101	100001	I don't have this concept of equivalent exchange in my data banks... If it's true, then should I feel the same way about you?	2000
105100102	100001	I've been studying how humans used to communicate... Well, you've got my attention, Commandant! Hmm... this doesn't seem to be working...	3000
105100103	100001	Witness Nanami's grand entrance! I'm the strongest!	4000
105100104	100001	What's it like to lose your hair? Nanami wants to try!	5000
105100105	100001	If you say so, then maaaaybe I'll remove a few more of my power limiters.	6000
105100106	100001	The more time I spend with you, the more I feel like I'm becoming a human...	2000
105100107	100001	All enemies are friends of Nanami!	3000
105100108	100001	You humans get to eat anything you want! I'm dying to try that strawberry thing one day!	4000
105100109	100001	Humans are sooo interesting! I'd like to study you more closely, if you don't mind—	5000
105100110	100001	Who knows, maybe one day Nanami will just disappear altogether... So, please try to remember me.	6000
105100301	100001	Commandant, you're here! Let's get started!	2000
105100302	100001	Commandant, you're not slacking off during work hours, are you?	3000
105100303	100001	I've learned so many things in the Gray Raven squad! Nanami loves it!	4000
105100304	100001	We go together like peas and carrots!	5000
105100305	100001	Humans always say that the unattainable is the most beautiful, do you think so too?	6000
105100306	100001	Stop eating in front of Nanami?! It makes me want to eat too...	2000
105100307	100001	Weird. My fixation with all things human has become a fixation of all things you.	3000
105100308	100001	Are all humans so eager to increase their affection levels?	4000
105100309	100001	I think... some emotions have no upper limits!	5000
105100310	100001	I'm working hard to meet you face to face one day.	6000
107100101	100001	Humans and Constructs are no different. We all realize our goals through battle.	2000
107100102	100001	I don't care who's the boss, as long as I get to fight.	3000
107100103	100001	I'm stronger than Lucia, right?	4000
107100104	100001	Make my schedule already.	5000
107100105	100001	...I feel my intellect dropping just by being in this team.	6000
107100106	100001	I can handle any weapons. Don't be stingy.	2000
107100107	100001	Tired already? Whatever. Go and get some rest. I'll take it from here.	3000
107100108	100001	You want to make me sharper? Then let me fight!	4000
107100109	100001	I ain't trying to get on your good side! This is just for me and me only!	5000
107100110	100001	There you are, finally! Next time I'm not hanging around.	6000
107100201	100001	I'm only here wasting time with you because of mission requirements.	2000
107100202	100001	Will I ever find something in my life that's more important than battling?	3000
107100203	100001	Well... You don't need to be this nice to me.	4000
107100204	100001	Wouldn't your time be better spent killing Corrupted?	5000
107100205	100001	I'm only here because you said so... It's not like I want to be here...	6000
107100206	100001	You want a taste of my cannon?!	2000
107100207	100001	Why do I hate Lucia? Because she's strong... I mean, nothing!	3000
107100208	100001	I should be the one beside you, not Lucia!	4000
107100209	100001	I-I'll try to pay you just a little bit more attention...	5000
107100210	100001	I've never felt... so close to a human before...	6000
107100301	100001	Is every team you lead this stupid?	2000
107100302	100001	Hm, let's see if this lets me fight better.	3000
107100303	100001	Hello? Babylonia to Commandant, are you there?	4000
107100304	100001	You're just like everyone else, toiling through the morning.	5000
107100305	100001	We're only doing this so we can fight better, yeah?	6000
107100306	100001	Are you sucking up to me?	2000
107100307	100001	I doubt I'll ever get this close... to anyone ever again...	3000
107100308	100001	Something more important than battle...? Y-you'll have to give me a hint!	4000
107100309	100001	I will become stronger and earn my place by your side.	5000
107100310	100001	I wonder, is there a place for me in your heart?	6000
106100101	100001	Nanami says humans would describe me as a "hot-blooded idiot". Is that true?	2000
106100102	100001	I'm Kamui. Good to meet you, Commandant!	3000
106100103	100001	I do have other interests, but fighting is what we do. Lucia's the same too, right?	4000
106100104	100001	Ha—there you are! Come on, let's get rumblin'!	5000
106100105	100001	What does remembrance feels like? I don't have such a function, so I don't know...	6000
106100106	100001	Humans dream. Do you ever dream of me?	2000
106100107	100001	Haha, oh nothing. Just smiling at you.	3000
106100108	100001	The very thought of fighting next to you sends energy coursing through my body.	4000
106100109	100001	Commandant! When are you going to take me on another mission—?!	5000
106100110	100001	Let's do our best in the future too!	6000
106100301	100001	You're full of beans today!	2000
106100302	100001	Have you eaten? You better. There's nothing to eat here if you get the munchies later.	3000
106100303	100001	You're the strangest Commandant I've ever seen... not that I'm complaining, haha!	4000
106100304	100001	Have I changed a lot? I'd change anything, as long as it's for you.	5000
106100305	100001	What am I going to do once the world is saved? Who cares, as long as we're together!	6000
106100306	100001	I'm just as good as Lee or Watanabe! I can be trusted with important missions too!	2000
106100307	100001	Have you eaten? You better. There's nothing to eat here if you get the munchies later.	3000
106100308	100001	Go and rest. I'm not going anywhere.	4000
106100309	100001	It's hard to describe how I feel, but I do know I feel happy.	5000
106100310	100001	You're the one who gives me the strength to keep moving forward.	6000
108100101	100001	There is no eternal trust nor eternal betrayal. They only last for how deep they run.	2000
108100102	100001	I don't particularly like humans... but for the moment we share the same objective.	3000
108100103	100001	I'll give it everything I've got.	4000
108100104	100001	You still haven't finalized the operation plans? Don't put it off much longer.	5000
108100105	100001	I'm not very good with these kinds of atmosphere... We should talk it out.	6000
108100106	100001	Weapons are like skills. The more you use them, the better you are at them.	2000
108100107	100001	I'll stay here. If anything weird happens, I'll let you know.	3000
108100108	100001	The night is dark and long. I know.	4000
108100109	100001	You have an immense power that can escape rules.	5000
108100110	100001	Fear not. I'll protect you.	6000
108100301	100001	Careful planning is the key to success. You should learn this skill.	2000
108100302	100001	Whatever. Please yourself.	3000
108100303	100001	At least the stars are worth looking at... Assuming there are no clouds.	4000
108100304	100001	For the rules I made, naturally, I get to break them.	5000
108100305	100001	What's in it for you?	6000
108100306	100001	Don't worry yourself too much about HQ. I'll keep an eye on things for you.	2000
108100307	100001	Too much paperwork? You seem very busy.	3000
108100308	100001	I'm just worried if people might be bullying you...	4000
108100309	100001	I must admit, I don't want to wreck what we've got...	5000
108100310	100001	I don't trust humans, but I trust you. Your existence is already rule-breaking.	6000
