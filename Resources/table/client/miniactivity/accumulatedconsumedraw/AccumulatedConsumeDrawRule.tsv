101	Lucky Draw	Guarantee Mechanic	Instructions				When you have drawn 20/40/60/80/100 times, you get milestone rewards, which are automatically sent to you when you reach their associated milestone. If you keep drawing after the last milestone, those draws will carry over to the next round of milestones.	Each [Lucky Draw] is a random result calculated based on the rates. It doesn't have a guarantee mechanic.	The [Fortune Pouches] you spend on [Lucky Draws] will expire after this event is over, and you will not be compensated. Make sure to use them in time.
