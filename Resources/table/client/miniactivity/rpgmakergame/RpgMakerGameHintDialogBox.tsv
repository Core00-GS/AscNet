1101	Keep going forward—looks like this is our only option.	3	3	3
1102	It seems like you'll have to get through the crucial Kuroro from the right to reach the endpoint...	3	3	3
1103	A Kuroro will run in the opposite direction if either a Construct shows up around it or another character is eliminated.	3	3	3
1104	It doesn't seem like you'll be able to make it to the endpoint going down. Is there a way to move the crucial Kuroro downward, though...	3	3	3
1105	Can you somehow push the crucial Kuroro to the left so it moves in sync with the patrolman...?	3	3	3
1106	Why don't you try approaching it from the side with Tai'E's help since you can't get close to it from below?	3	3	3
1107	And Tai'E only shows up on odd rounds, eh... I see what you're saying. We definitely can't miss this opportunity.	3	3	3
1108	You can make it straight to the endpoint if You can push the Kuroro on the right to the top.	3	3	3
1109	If you want to push Kuroro upward to make it a stepping stone, you'll need to take advantage of the fact that it runs away when it gets scared.	3	3	3
1110	It seems like you can keep moving and change location and direction if you move close to Tai'E from the side.	3	3	3
1201	I have a bad feeling about these pools. You just might be able to make your way through them if you can freeze them.	3	3	3
1202	Kuroros will run away in fear, too, if the character around its fall into the water.	3	3	3
1203	There is water all around the Kuroro at the bottom. Maybe we don't need to make our hands dirty at all, Commandant.	3	3	3
1204	You can probably use the Kuroro in the upper-right corner. Keep it safe until you're done using it.	3	3	3
1205	It seems like there is no way you'll ever be able to reach the Kuroro up there... Guess you'll need a few extra hands.	3	3	3
1206	After spotting an abnormal occurrence in its sight, the Roseblade will move to where it took place in the next round.	3	3	3
1207	Roseblade won't stop in front of the pool. If only you can move it forward...	3	3	3
1208	Is there a way we can move the Kuroro in the middle down to the bottom...?	3	3	3
1209	You need to catch the stepping stone with another stone so it won't fall into the water.	3	3	3
1210	The butler won't come down for you if you don't knock on the door.	3	3	3
1301	Be careful. The Kuroro carries fire with it, and fire will melt ice...	3	3	3
1302	The Kuroro has decided to burn through the ice. You'll have to go around to get close to it, then.	3	3	3
1303	If you stand on the green mark, all the stone gates with the same mark will drop down.	3	3	3
1304	You need someone to keep these stone gates from going back up so you can get close to the Kuroro in the bottom-left corner...	3	3	3
1305	Let's burn the grass first. The path that appeared doesn't seem like a difficult walk at all.	3	3	3
1306	The Kuroro at the bottom is wrapped up in ice under the bushes. Try to get close to it from the side.	3	3	3
1307	There are quite a few pools on the field, and the Kuroro is an Ice Kuroro. I wonder if we can somehow get its help...	3	3	3
1308	You'll need to come up with a way to burn down the grass that's blocking its way before luring out Roseblade.	3	3	3
1309	Now, imagine for a second that the Kuroro up there is all alone by itself...	3	3	3
1310	Move up the Fire Kuroro at the bottom so it can work with the Kuroro on the right.	3	3	3
1401	The Lightning Circle pulls in all the characters and Kuroros that carry Lightning Attribute with them.	3	3	3
1402	Use Lightning Circle	3	3	3
1403	Pushing Kuroros into the water seems to come with more benefits than one.	3	3	3
1404	If you can somehow keep the Kuroro from moving away from the Lightning Circle on the right...	3	3	3
1405	Now, both Kuroros carry Lightning Attribute with them—which doesn't just happen for no reason. It has to be a hint.	3	3	3
1406	Move to the right from the get-go and let miracles happen.	3	3	3
1407	Lightning Attribute still works even when it's carried by a Kuroro.	3	3	3
1408	Push the Kuroro to the right and make the grass grow so you can land on it.	3	3	3
1409	You need to clear the path up to the endpoint with Roseblade. Try to block its way with the grass.	3	3	3
1410	Head to the right and block Tai'E clockwise. The endpoint is right there.	3	3	3
1501	You don't have another choice... Need I say more, Commandant?	3	3	3
1502	It teleports everything—even Kuroros, yes. Chase it down and make it your stepping stone.	3	3	3
1503	Let's familiarize ourselves with it: Teleport it into the mist and follow it.	3	3	3
1504	The mist has multiple entrances and exits, so best of luck choosing the right path.	3	3	3
1505	To start with, you can try getting rid of the elemental Kuroros, Commandant.	3	3	3
1506	Hold off on changing direction when you're done eliminating the Kuroro at the bottom. See, there is a crypt below the Lightning Circle.	3	3	3
1507	Try destroying the Lightning Circle on the left, Commandant. The Kuroro will take care of the rest.	3	3	3
1508	Try to make the Kuroro on the left fall into the water, then approach the crucial Kuroro using Teleporting Mist.	3	3	3
1509	It seems like you'll have to make a round.	3	3	3
1510	It doesn't seem like you can make it straight to the endpoint... You'll have to catch the Kuroros that fall and make them into a wall to catch yourself with.	3	3	3
2101	Keep going forward—looks like this is our only option.	3	3	3
2102	Changing your direction immediately after you stop doesn't seem to work here.	3	3	3
2103	I see... A Kukuro will run in the opposite direction whenever a Construct shows up near it.	3	3	3
2104	And it seems like they get scared and run away, too, when enemies around them are eliminated.	3	3	3
2105	If you could push the upper-right Kuroro up...	3	3	3
2106	It will be easier if we can patch the opening on the left.	3	3	3
2107	Watch out, Commandant. That red circle shows Shark-speare's detection range.	3	3	3
2108	The walls in front of the endpoint are pretty smooth. How do I make it to the other side...?	3	3	3
2109	Look carefully. There are only two paths leading to the endpoint. If you can take one of them...	3	3	3
2110	Tai'E moves along a fixed route in each turn... And anything with a predictable pattern can be exploited.	3	3	3
2201	You will also be able to control the shadows, but they won't scare Kuroro off or eliminate them.	3	3	3
2202	Hmm... Is there a way to get pass the walls and get to the area below?	3	3	3
2203	It seems there is only one entrance to the area below.	3	3	3
2204	Those holes look dangerous... Remember to avoid them.	3	3	3
2205	Kuroro will be scared and run if someone falls into a trap hole.	3	3	3
2206	You have to sacrifice your own shadow when necessary.	3	3	3
2207	It seems better to reach the Kuroro on the left edge from above or right.	3	3	3
2208	The key is to get back to the area above from below and reach the endpoint.	3	3	3
2209	On the bright side, with the detection range and traps around, we're bound to steer clear of some of the wrong paths.	3	3	3
2210	The endpoint and Shark-speare are surrounded by walls. Is there anything we can use as a stepping stone...?	3	3	3
2301	The Electro-Walls are electrified, so be careful not to bump into them. Step on the switch to turn them off.	3	3	3
2302	You don't always need to get your hands dirty to get what you want.	3	3	3
2303	One and only objective: Turn off the switch.	3	3	3
2304	You don't have to push every single button, Commandant. Stay focused.	3	3	3
2305	There is only one entrance at the endpoint. How can we get there...?	3	3	3
2306	Turn off the switch before using the Kuroro as stepping stones, otherwise, they will be eliminated by the Electro-Walls.	3	3	3
2307	We have to find a stepping stone to reach the endpoint after eliminating the Kuroro in the upper-left corner...	3	3	3
2308	Don't be scared by the Electro-Walls, Commandant. Those are just paper tigers.	3	3	3
2309	Try to finish the battle in the middle of the battlefield. Don't let Kuroro escape to the right side.	3	3	3
2310	Sometimes you need to move more than once to get Kuroro to the place where it needs to be.	3	3	3
2401	I know it's hard but please keep me safe, Commandant.	3	3	3
2402	Watch out for the trap hole on the right. Even I don't want to fall into it.	3	3	3
2403	Try to kill Shark-speare first.	3	3	3
2404	Get the Kuroro above down and use it as a stepping stone, not me.	3	3	3
2405	Sometimes you have to take the longer path to make the best use of your stepping stone, Commandant.	3	3	3
2406	You want to evacuate people who shouldn't be there before starting a hunt.	3	3	3
2407	Don't fight Kuroro the second you enter the battle. Take a walk around it first.	3	3	3
2408	You only have a few ways to reach the key Kuroro. Moving from left to right could be a good idea.	3	3	3
2409	You could use the help of Celica when necessary, Commandant.	3	3	3
2410	...I can also be your assistant if necessary, Commandant.	3	3	3
2501	After spotting an abnormal occurrence in its sight, the Roseblade will move to where it took place in the next round.	3	3	3
2502	Distract the Roseblade and don't look back no matter what is blocking your way.	3	3	3
2503	You could use the help of your allies, including me, when necessary, Commandant.	3	3	3
2504	Enemies that will only move under certain conditions are just moving stepping stones.	3	3	3
2505	You have to stop the Kuroro on the left to reach the Kuroro on the right.	3	3	3
2506	Use the Roseblade as your stepping stone, Commandant.	3	3	3
2507	You can never have too many stepping stones. Get yourself two stepping stones if one is not enough.	3	3	3
2508	Places that are hard to reach won't be a big deal when you have the help of the stepping stones.	3	3	3
2509	I've seen a complete letter S. You are on its tail, Commandant.	3	3	3
2510	The Roseblade here won't stay very long. You need to make him stay somewhere.	3	3	3
3101	Keep going forward—looks like this is our only option.	3	3	3
3102	Think about it... If Kuroro on the left wasn't there...	3	3	3
3103	Changing your direction immediately after you stop doesn't seem to work here.	3	3	3
3104	I see... A Kukuro will run in the opposite direction whenever a Construct shows up near it.	3	3	3
3105	It's a bit far... But there must be a way to approach the Kuroro up top.	3	3	3
3106	The Kuroro on the right cannot be eliminated directly, but if you use that...	3	3	3
3107	Make good use of your enemies, Commandant.	3	3	3
3108	Instead of eliminating each enemy, maybe you can use them to your advantage.	3	3	3
3201	Watch out, Commandant. That red circle shows Shark-speare's detection range.	3	3	3
3202	The area outside the red circle is Shark-speare's blind spot. Time to strike now!	3	3	3
3203	The enemies on the top side are impossible to break through... Why not turn to the ones on the bottom?	3	3	3
3204	"Move along a fixed route in each turn"... Indeed, the more regular of a routine, the easier it is to spot a fatal flaw.	3	3	3
3205	Sometimes it's not bad to take a detour...	3	3	3
3206	Only if you can lure the Kuroro to the bottom left corner... But how?	3	3	3
3207	That patrolman was just bluffing. Don't let him get away, Commandant!	3	3	3
3208	There are two Kuroro... You have to think carefully about which one should be dealt with first.	3	3	3
3301	There's only one way for sure, right, Commandant?	3	3	3
3302	Let's ignore the Kuroro on your left for now.	3	3	3
3303	Looks like they're going in different directions. If we choose the right one...	3	3	3
3304	If you're finding it difficult... Why not take a look at the Kuroro on the right?	3	3	3
3305	It's not difficult to predict their next move based on their movement pattern. Go right first, Commandant.	3	3	3
3306	The patrolman and stone gate are in line with each other. If we can trap him...	3	3	3
3307	Looks like... Now's the time to take down all the enemies at once.	3	3	3
3308	The Kuroro up top can't be taken out from here, but if you can use that...	3	3	3
3401	...I'm sure you're aware that you've only got one choice.	3	3	3
3402	Please keep in mind that a new path might form when the terrain changes, Commandant.	3	3	3
3403	...It's a dead end? Well then, we'll just have to make them clear the way!	3	3	3
3404	The top one seems to be a decoy... Wanna know how I know that? My intuition!	3	3	3
3405	Let's eliminate the enemies on the bottom first, Commandant.	3	3	3
3406	It's fine to let your enemies run for a while... And please remember to count your steps.	3	3	3
3407	The terrain toward the top is complicated. Don't let your enemies get there, Commandant.	3	3	3
3408	It's not always bad to take a detour... Hmm? Is that an infinity symbol?	3	3	3
