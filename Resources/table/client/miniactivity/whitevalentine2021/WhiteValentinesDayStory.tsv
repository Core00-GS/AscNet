4	Encounter: Alpha	Alpha pulls you onto her jet ski before you can rent one. The waves almost knock you over, but she catches you in time.

8	Encounter: Lux	Having met Liv as you both bought crepes from the food truck, you swap your different-favored crepes with each other halfway through. Liv looks happy to you.

12	Encounter: Zero	You have afternoon tea with Bianca after running into her shopping and helping carry her things. She gives you a whole bunch of vouchers.

16	Encounter: Storm	Having gotten lost in the float parade, you run into Nanami, who is pretending to be an NPC. You two hide in the parade, not discovered until the very end.
17	Encounter: Pulse	After getting a higher score than Nanami out of sheer luck at the Game Center, she drags you to play 20 games of Zevious BX with her nonstop.
18	Encounter: Nightblade	Taking a stroll on the beach, you cannot resist digging up some of the clams and mussels, and you run into Watanabe, who is also squatting on the beach.
19	Encounter: Astral	Coming upon a flea market, you witness Watanabe's exceptional bargaining skills as he purchases two large cases of gifts for the Forsaken children.
20	Encounter: Arclight	While visiting the aquarium, Chrome explains to you the differences between the fishes in different biospheres with more in-depth knowledge than a tour guide.
21	Encounter: Silverfang	Playing hide-and-seek in the Venus Splash Park, you only find Sophia at the very end. She has been hiding near where you started the whole time.

24	Encounter: Rigor	Watching the old animated movie "Shark-speare's Adventure" at the holo-cinema in the park, you find Rosetta sitting beside you, moved by Shark-speare's resolve.
25	Encounter: Pavo	You have to comb Qu's hair for nearly an hour after riding the roller-coaster with her. Due to her long hair, you barely saw anything during the ride sitting behind her.
26	Encounter: Qilin	You run into Changyu, who is holding a handful of game coins at the Game Center. He proceeds to drag you to the gift counter and clear it out.
27	Encounter: Laurel	You and Luna watch moon jellies together after you run into her at the aquarium. She is mesmerized by how the frail creatures simply drift along the waves.
28	Encounter: Brilliance	You watch as seagulls knock over Ayla's paint while she is painting on the beach, and her work eventually becomes...
29	Encounter: Tempest	You find Selena playing her violin impromptu at the center of the square. Somehow, her violin case is filled with Venus Coupons.

63	Encounter: XXI	No. 21 has been standing at the beach for quite some time now. Letting the water wet her knees and sleeves, she seems to be feeling and remembering some unknown smell.

65	Encounter: Garnet	Vera stands tall at the beach with a spear in hand. "Smoothie On Sale" is what it says in squiggling letters on the flag when the sea breeze ruffles it. There is the draw, but who's going to run the shop?

69	Encounter: Empyrea	Looking up at the sky, you see Liv floating in the air, almost one with the clouds. You can't quite tell if she is just playing or dancing up there.
