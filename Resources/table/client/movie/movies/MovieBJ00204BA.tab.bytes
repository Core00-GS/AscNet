3	3		301									Bexonidas is deep in thought.																						
4	4		301									"Deep in thought" might not be the best way to put it. He's holding an assault rifle, after all, and it's aimed at the observation post, jutting out of the distant trench.																						
5	5		301									The tendons of his finger are wound tight, suspended over his rifle's double-action trigger. Within a tenth of a second of receiving the order to fire, his trusty weapon will unleash the rage he's been saving up this entire time.																						
6	6		301									But yes, he's still deep in thought. The nine warriors next to him would have no idea what he was pondering in the moment.																						
7	7		301									They've all been through the same training, inherited blood and duty from their Forsaken predecessors. Like their forefathers, they are stoic, courageous instruments of death.																						
8	8		301									Bexonidas looks no different from the others if not for the insignia he wears on his shoulder, marking him as a Sergeant.																						
9	9		301									But Bexonidas has more responsibility on his shoulders than his nine brothers‚Äîhe's the leader, after all.																						
10	10		301									But at this very moment, the group is in a foxhole, far away from both their base and the fight, weapons trained on their enemies at all times‚Äîyet not allowed to fire.																						
11	11		301									Their mission is simply to observe and guide the shells in.																						
12	12		301									That's why, instead of shooting, Bexonidas is simply deep in thought.																						
13	13		301									Bexonidas.																						
14	14		301								Gryphon	Hm?																						
15	15		301								Bexonidas	We're changing shifts in half an hour. Halam and I will take over. You and Castien can rest a bit at the bottom of the trench.																						
16	16		301								Gryphon	How's the motion sensor?																						
17	17		301								Bexonidas	It's as quiet as Lake Baikal at night. Nothing to worry about.																						
18	18		301								Gryphon	In that case, I'll go on patrol for a bit.																						
19	19		301								Bexonidas	...Not gonna stop you hogging the work.																						
20	20		301								Gryphon	Gryphon is used to Bexonidas going patrolling during his off time. In fact, he'd probably be surprised if Bexonidas actually decides to rest.																						
21	21		301									Bexonidas has been squad leader for five years. For five years, he took care of all nine members of his team diligently and thoughtfully.																						
22	22		301									Gryphon decides to discreetly extend his own shift and shorten Bexonidas'.																						
23	23		301									Just like how Bexonidas takes care of other squad members, Gryphon and the others do their best to look out for Bexonidas as well.																						
24	24		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					...There's no need to tell each other about what they know. They're thinking the same thing.																						
25	25		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After checking the motion sensor once again and deeming it satisfactory, Bexonidas stands up from the temporary barricade.																						
26	26		301								Command Central	Command Central to 19-1.																						
27	27		301								Bexonidas	19-1 copies.																						
28	28		301								Command Central	"Ash" has responded. You'll be moving to the rear soon.																						
29	29		301								Command Central	But before that, there's one more mission you must complete...																						
30	30		301									Bexonidas stands erect in the ravaging desert winds, radio in hand, expression frozen.																						
31	31		301								Bexonidas	...																						
32	32		301								Bexonidas	...Roger. We'll get it done.

41	41		301							1	Lee	Incoming shortwave on your terminal.	1																					
42	42		301									Following Lee's finger, I see the flashing red signal on my personal terminal.																						
43	43		302								Who could it be...	44																						
44	44		301								Lee	Unfortunately, ID recognition doesn't work for shortwave messages.	1																					
45	45		302								All right, I see.	46																						
46	46		302								(Patch it through)	47																						
47	47		301								ÔºüÔºüÔºü	And here I thought you'd forgotten about this special channel.																						
48	48		301									A familiar voice comes on the line, though you know it to be a composite from a simulation device.																						
49	49		301									You still somehow detect a sense of relief.																						
50	50		302								Watanabe.	51																						
51	51		301								Watanabe	Heard you guys are on a mission... so I thought I'd come see you.																						
52	52		302								You heard?	53																						
53	53		301								Watanabe	I "heard".																						
54	54		301									...Always with the hidden meanings.																						
55	55		302								You need something?	56																						
56	56		301								Watanabe	I need your help. Or should I say... I need Gray Raven's help.																						
57	57		301								Watanabe	Some of my guys in the area got into some trouble.																						
58	58		301								Lee	What kind of trouble?	1																					
59	59		301								Lee	If there's a certain someone tagging along, thanks, but no...	1																					
60	60		302								Lee.	61																						
61	61		302								Let him finish.	62																						
62	62		301								Watanabe	Thanks. I'll get to it.																						
63	63		301								Watanabe	There's a doomsday defense line not far from your position. Two Forsaken squads are stationed there.																						
64	64		301								Watanabe	However, an unidentified force popped up recently and chased them out... or I should say, kicked them out.																						
65	65		301								Watanabe	This force appears to utilize techniques that you're familiar with, so I would like your help with this.																						
66	66		301									...																						
67	67		301									...Did something happen to the Nighter after that...?																						
68	68		301									Guess we can't sit back and watch, even if Watanabe hadn't asked us for help.																						
69	69		302								Let me think about it.	70																						
70	70		301								Watanabe	Think fast.																						
71	71		301									The connection is cut.

107	107		301								Bexonidas	So far, allied artillery and landmines have divided enemies occupying the K-44 defense line into several small groups.	2																					
108	108		301								Bexonidas	If we hammer each group in their weak spots, we should be able to break through. The issue, however, is manpower...	2																					
109	109		301								Watanabe	What about the guys from Squadron 22? They're tasked to K-44 too.	1																					
110	110		301								Bexonidas	The guys from Squadron 22 have put every mortar they have into action, sir. They've been taking shifts, hammering the border day and night.	2																					
111	111		301								Watanabe	...In that case, we'll leave it to my "guests" to break the standstill.	1																					
112	112		301								Watanabe	You guys carry on with what you're doing.	1																					
113	113		301								Bexonidas	Got it. 19-1 will continue our spotting mission.	2
