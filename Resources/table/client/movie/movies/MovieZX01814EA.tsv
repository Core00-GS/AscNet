8	8		202							1					1																			
9	9		301									Wanshi's lips move faintly, spitting out vital fluid on the "Gear". He cannot see the figure's expression, but he can see that the light source on its body gradually changes from fluorescent to dark red.																						
10	10		201							1	500288																							
11	11		301			PanelActor1Shake				1	Gear?	Ah... How blasphemous and banal.	1																					
12	12		202							1					1																			
13	13		401							2	1503																							
14	14		301			RImgBg1Shake						"Gear" slowly lifts up Wanshi, then throws him onto the ground, cracking the ground from the force of the impact.																						
15	15		301									Wanshi's body slightly bounces into the air from the impact. Just as he is about to land, "Gear" catches him by the left leg.																						
16	16		201							1	500288																							
17	17		301							1	Gear?	Endeavors deprived of faith are merely mundane shellsâ€”vulnerable and meaningless.	1																					
18	18		301								Gear?	How disappointing.	1																					
19	19		202							1					1																			
20	20		401							2	1503																							
21	21		301			RImgBg1Shake						"Gear" speaks, slamming Wanshi to the ground on both sides like a doll in the hands of a child. "Gear" lifts Wanshi above its head, then slams him down again.																						
22	22		201							1	500288																							
23	23		301							1	Gear?	You may be weak, but you still manage to withstand a beating, foolish one.	1																					
24	24		301									This continues for some time, but the thrashing from "Gear" appears to be slowing.																						
25	25		301								Gear?	...Hmm?	1																					
26	26		401							2	1545																							
27	27		301									"Gear" looks down at Wanshi clenched within its right hand to discover that it is covered in a layer of frost.																						
28	28		301									Due to the numbing cold of the frost, it had no idea that a layer of ice had formed. Although it is not thick, the ice affects its ability to control its limbs.

30	30		201							2	500273	4	200																					
31	31		301				DialogDisable			1		Wanshi lifts his right leg and delivers a powerful kick to "Gear's" forearm. Coupled with the numbing frost on the joint of its right hand, Wanshi is finally able to free himself from its clamp.	1	2

33	33		203							1	0.4	-200																						
34	34		203							2	0.25	600																						
35	35		301			DialogEnable						After seeing Wanshi break away, "Gear" immediately swings his left hand to catch its prey again.	1	2

39	39		301									Falling to the ground, Wanshi shoots a silver orb of light at "Gear's" head.																						
40	40		301									Right as the orb of light is about to land a direct hit, "Gear" turns its head at an awkward angle and deflects the shot. Barely grazing the armor on its cheek with a trail of glistening sparks, the beam shoots off into the sky.																						
41	41		201							1	500288																							
42	42		301							1	Gear?	Is that all? Trivial scum!	1																					
43	43		301									Grievously wounded, Wanshi smirks as if to indicate that the attack was not as trivial as "Gear" was lead on to believe. It quickly turns to look in the direction of the orb of light.																						
44	44		301									It turns to discover Troy, which it had previously sent flying, floating in the air. Only once Troy firmly wraps the orb of light around its hand does "Gear" see the attack's true form.																						
45	45		301									It is a silver conical claw attached to a transparent composite rope. This thin rope, which is now attached to "Gear's" frozen right hand, is connected to a snare gun wielded by Wanshi.																						
46	46		201							1	500273	4																						
47	47		301							1	Wanshi	Sleep tight.	1																					
48	48		202							1					1																			
49	49		301									Wanshi tosses the snare gun behind "Gear" and quickly rolls to the side. Flying behind the enemy, the snare quickly wraps around "Gear" and tightly ensnares its limbs.																						
50	50		301									Once the snare gun completely secures "Gear", it transforms into a square sheet and adheres tightly to the back of "Gear", preventing it from freeing itself.

54	54		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryLouDianNew.prefab		1																					
55	55		301							1		At the same time, Troy grabs the silver claw and flies over a raised section of the ruins, then quickly descends to the other side.																						
56	56		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStorySandNew.prefab	2																							
57	57		301			PanelActor1Shake						Troy's injuries cause him to collapse onto the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust and smoke around him. The thin rope hoists "Gear" up, leaving it hanging in the air.																						
58	58		301							1		Dragging his left leg, Wanshi limps over to Troy and helps him up. Troy plants the claw into the floor, then Wanshi drops a frost grenade next to the claw.																						
59	59		401							2	1545																							
60	60		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Right as Wanshi and Troy leave, the grenade activates and freezes the claw to the floor of the ruins.

66	66		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Wanshi	Looks like our equipment won't hold out much longer. Have you relayed all of the enemy intel?	2																					
67	67		301								Troy	No, I can't seem to send it. Seems like something in the air is jamming our signal with Babylonia.	1																					
68	68		301									Troy points up, but as Wanshi looks in the direction of his finger, all that can be seen is the thick cover of night that has imprisoned the entire area in darkness. Moonlight tries to pierce the dense layer of clouds, but only a dim glimmer of light reaches the ground.																						
69	69		301								Wanshi	Nothing on the scanner... Maybe it's the same composition as that thing back there.	2																					
70	70		301								Troy	Initiate emergency evac plan. See that fork up ahead? Let's split up there, then meet back at the evac point.	1																					
71	71		301								Wanshi	Alright... Got it.	2																					
72	72		301								Troy	Sync up the time. 0043.	1																					
73	73		301								Wanshi	0043.	2																					
74	74		301								Troy	No problem. ETA for the evac point is three hours. Give each other a five minute window.	1																					
75	75		301								Troy	Switch comms to stealth mode in five minutes to prevent us from being followed.	1																					
76	76		301									After Wanshi gives the two of them basic first aid, they lean up against the corner of the building separating their paths. The air is so quiet that they can hear their breathing.																						
77	77		301								Troy	Signal off. Entering stealth mode.	1																					
78	78		301								Wanshi	Ditto.	2																					
79	79		301									After the final confirmation, Troy and Wanshi get up and break off in different directions. Right then, Wanshi hears Troy's voice coming from behind him.

93	92		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The ice crystals begin to gradually melt under the high temperature generated by "Gear". Clenching its right fist, "Gear" breaks the composite rope ensnaring its body and smashes into the ground with a heavy thud.																						
94	93		201							1	500288																							
95	94		301							1	Gear?	Dannazione. Run if you so dare, wretched fools.	1																					
96	95		301								Gear?	Preparations must still be made for the path that will lead us to "Sage".	1																					
97	96		301									After losing its counterweight, the rope snaps and falls limply to the ground. "Gear" throws the composite rope still clinging to its body aside and looks in the direction in which Troy and Wanshi had left.																						
98	97		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Gear?	This may take longer than anticipated, but all potential threats must be eliminated.	1

102	100		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Wanshi arduously makes his way through the abandoned city and crater-filled streets.																						
103	101		301									Moonlight cascades on the broken buildings, casting overlapping shadows like the tenebrous depths of a lake. The night breeze passes through an open building and blasts Wanshi with hot wind and gravel.																						
104	102		301									Ravaged by war, buildings throughout the city have toppled to their foundation. Some are no longer covered by roofs; others are now only empty shells. The disjointed buildings that still remain standing appear ready to collapse at the slightest gust of wind and sand.																						
105	103		301									The monotonous scenery continues to extend in front of Wanshi. No matter where he goes, he sees similar ruins.																						
106	104		201							1	500273	4

110	108		301									The dormant pain begins to resurface, disrupting each of his data circuits. The severe pain causes Wanshi to stumble to the ground.																						
111	109		201							1	500273																							
112	110		301							1	Wanshi	Nrgh, Wanshi... Now's not the time for a nap.	1

118	116		301									Wanshi's eyesight begins to tremble slightly. The sound of the wind in his ears becomes distant. He feels himself drift away from the world like the sensation just before falling asleep.

123	121		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Right as Wanshi's body is about to forcibly shut down his vision module due to his injuries, a figure appears before him.																						
124	122		301								???	...?																						
125	123		301								Wanshi	...Who...																						
126	124		301								???	A human...? No...																						
127	125		301								???	I must... first...																						
128	126		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					The stranger walks closer, but his voice becomes more distant. All Wanshi can feel is endless darkness.
