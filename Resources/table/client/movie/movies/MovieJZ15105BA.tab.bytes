4	4		301									After they flee the city, Camu stalks off away from the other survivors under the moonlight.																						
5	5		301									He tears off his shirt, revealing his battle-hardened body‚Äîor should he call it his serum-ravaged body?																						
6	6		301									Even before his squadmate's "accident," Camu had already noticed certain abnormalities within his body.																						
7	7		301								Camu	I don't feel a thing...																						
8	8		301									Camu tries to touch the abnormal parts, but no matter what he does, he feels nothing and gets no reaction.																						
9	9		301									That part of his body can no longer be salvaged. Camu knows that, one day, he will end up like his dead squadmate...																						
10	10		301								Camu	An antibody experiment, huh? Serum.. mixed with the Punishing Virus?																						
11	11		301									Before they fled the city, the pilot called him "Corrupted". Though unacquainted with the relevant research, Camu can still easily come to the only possible conclusion.																						
12	12		301									That must be why the guards at the gate kept their distance from him, and why he was never allowed to enter the cities.																						
13	13		301									And why the body of his companions had to be preserved carefully and returned to Kurono.																						
14	14		301									‚Äî‚ÄîBecause their squad had all been injected with the Punishing Virus.																						
15	15		301									The pilot also called them "flawed". Which meant that the superiors believed that this experiment could no longer continue.																						
16	16		301									They're trying to destroy all evidence that this experiment had happened by burying Camu's squad in eternal darkness.																						
17	17		301								Camu	What the ****? ****!																						
18	18		301									Camu already knew that, as low-level squads, they would never be treated well. They might even be deployed somewhere dangerous where they could easily die.																						
19	19		301									But he sure did not expect to become a test subject‚Äîa failed one, at that. One that would eventually become a Corrupted and die.

24	24		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Soldier A	Camu! We thought you were captured by the Kurono guys.	1																					
25	25		301									The other survivors appear and interrupt him from his thoughts. They have all patched each other up and have came before Camu for further orders.

27	27		301							1	Camu	What are you guys doing with the luggage?	3																					
28	28		301								Soldier A	Fleeing, of course. We've still got some supplies. We should be able to survive if we find the right place.	1																					
29	29		301								Soldier B	Too bad we don't have our van anymore. If we go somewhere Kurono can't find us, we'll have to face lots of Corrupted...	2																					
30	30		301								Soldier A	But with the Corrupted, at least we can choose whether to fight or flee. If the opponent is Kurono... well, do you think we can survive a bombing like that a second time?	1																					
31	31		301								Camu	So is fleeing your only option? Don't you want revenge?	3																					
32	32		301								Soldier A	So... what do YOU want to do?	1																					
33	33		301								Camu	I want to get my revenge on Kurono. They have a base around here, right?	3																					
34	34		301								Camu	Rally all survivors, attack the stronghold, and destroy them all!	3																					
35	35		301								Soldier B	That won't work. We'd basically be walking to our graves. And even if it works, they'll send others after us...	2																					
36	36		301								Camu	Then we'll destroy the next base. And the next.	3																					
37	37		301								Soldier B	Huh?	2																					
38	38		301								Camu	Surely you must have noticed that the serum's mixed with something else! And the abnormal changes in your body!	3																					
39	39		301								Camu	Even if we don't get killed on the way, we'll die from the painful side effects of the serum, just like the others.	3																					
40	40		301								Camu	By fleeing, you're simply prolonging your suffering before you eventually die. I'm not doing that.	3																					
41	41		301								Camu	I'm not someone who'd just shut up and bear it when I'm betrayed. If I have to die either way...	3																					
42	42		301								Camu	I'll show them the true meaning of fear.	3																					
43	43		301								Soldier A	What‚Äî	1																					
44	44		202								1	2																						
45	45		301									The others stare, mouth agape, as a crazed expression begins to overtake Camu. But when Camu pulls out the greatsword he had stuck in the ground and steps forward...																						
46	46		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					They all follow.
