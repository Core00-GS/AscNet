4	4		301									Those keywords were all Bianca knew about cranes as they often appeared in the data.																						
5	5		301									Babylonia's database had a detailed section about cranes, but Bianca struggled to link those text and images with the actual creatures. After all, she had never seen them in real life.																						
6	6		301									During the Golden Age, the earth was overdeveloped and animals could only be kept in nature reserves.																						
7	7		301									Humans "blessed" them with stable environments and food supplies, which made them forget their nature over time.																						
8	8		301									But without such blessings, the animals were extremely fragile in the wilderness during the Post-Pandemic Age. Cranes were no exception.																						
9	9		301									During many missions on the earth as the officer of Purifying Force, Bianca had never seen this so-called creature of elegance.																						
10	10		301									To her, cranes were more like a mythical symbol...																						
11	11		301									As always, Bianca finished her usual prayer. She raised her head and stretched her back, bathing in sunlight.																						
12	12		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Unlike always, she then received a message. One that somewhat linked her with cranes, the creature that she only knew in data.

15	15		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Asimov	Have you heard of the "Combat Unit Booster" that the Science Council and WGAA mentioned in the routine meeting?	1

17	17		201							2	500128	1	400																					
18	18		301							1	Bianca	Yes. I had already used it in a previous operation.	2																					
19	19		301								Asimov	Good, saves me the time to explain it again. I hate going through the same piece of basic information over and over.	1																					
20	20		301								Asimov	We have a new model of Combat Unit Booster, but we can't use it yet.	1																					
21	21		301								Asimov	Because it's still "uncooperative."	1																					
22	22		204							2																								
23	23		301								Bianca	...Uncooperative?	2																					
24	24		301								Asimov	...It's a long story. I'll try to make it short.	1																					
25	25		301								Asimov	The improved Combat Unit Boosters all had new AI installed for better tactical support and coordination with the Task Force.	1																					
26	26		301								Asimov	Allen was really pushing for it... So WGAA was also brought into the design of this AI system, in the name of "Combat Unit Booster simulation optimization." I should have told them off in the meeting, but it's all too late now.	1																					
27	27		301								Asimov	Anyway, here's the end result. Although this new model has substantially improved performance and situational awareness, but... it has developed strong hostility toward all Constructs trying to work with it.	1																					
28	28		301								Asimov	We tried to limit its aggressive actions in the lab... But it simply abandoned the collaborator and escaped in the very first field test.	1																					
29	29		301								Asimov	Unfortunately, we don't have the manpower needed for a thorough search... So we can only rely on the Purifying Force, who excels in pursuit and solo search operations.	1																					
30	30		301								Asimov	I know you would be an overkill for such a task, but we must bring it back at all cost, even if we are to tear it apart later.	1																					
31	31		301								Asimov	Because it is the very first prototype of this version of Combat Unit Booster. The raw data inside its storage unit would also help us to prevent similar accidents in future...	1																					
32	32		204							2	1																							
33	33		301								Bianca	Understood. I'll take the mission.	2																					
34	34		301								Asimov	...That's great news.	1																					
35	35		301								Bianca	The fact that you have come to me means it has to be me. Right?	2																					
36	36		301								Asimov	Correct. I don't intent to hide that from you.	1																					
37	37		301								Bianca	That's enough.	2																					
38	38		301								Asimov	Appreciated. Your cabin's ready. My assistant will show you the way.	1																					
39	39		301								Bianca	You're welcome. On a side note, I think you need more rest. The dark circles around your eyes are very obvious.	2																					
40	40		301								Asimov	...Are they? Thanks...	1

43	43		301									After seeing Bianca leave, Asimov touched the rims of his eyes.																						
44	44		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Asimov	...It's been almost five days since I last slept. Probably should take a leave after this.	1

47	47		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Bianca	Bianca reporting. Area 9 search complete. Nothing found.	1

49	49		301								Comms	...																						
50	50		201							1	500128																							
51	51		301							1	Bianca	I have reached the collapsed buildings in area 10.	1																					
52	52		301									At a glance, the wasteland looked no different from the numerous places that Bianca visited, or fought on.																						
53	53		301									A few water puddles were reflecting the sunlight among sand and ruins, with some greenery around.																						
54	54		301									Countless Corrupted still ravaged the land, the threat of Ascendants was still present.																						
55	55		301									But the world didn't seem to care.																						
56	56		301									Flowers and grass grew in the ruins. Sunlight was refracted by the puddles, and turned into green light circles onto a gray broken wall.																						
57	57		301									This almost looks like a miracle described in books, Bianca thought.																						
58	58		301								Bianca	Entering the buildings now for further exploration.	1																					
59	59		202							1					1																			
60	60		301								Comms	F-further...? But all the locations marked in the brief are open areas. CUBs don't seem to possess the intelligence to conceal themselves...																						
61	61		301								Comms	Please further elaborate your reason for the exploration...																						
62	62		201							1	500128																							
63	63		301							1	Bianca	I think the urgency of this mission does not contradict the need for a more thorough search. That's all I have to say.	1																					
64	64		202							1					1																			
65	65		301								Comms	...Sure, no problem. Very solid reason. Please continue your search of area 10.																						
66	66		301								Comms	But please don't mention my name should anyone asks... Um, no, just tell them it's me. I can handle it. Please, please don't put my name down on your list. Haha...																						
67	67		201							1	500128																							
68	68		301							1	Bianca	...	1																					
69	69		301									Bianca heard fear and panic in every word of the conversation. A situation that she was too familiar with as the captain of the Purifying Force.																						
70	70		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She let out a quiet sigh, then closed the comms without further explanation and walked deeper inside the ruins.																						
71	71		202							1					1																			
72	72		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory6.jpg																								
73	73		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The pattern of the walls nearby became more visible as she ventured forward.																						
74	74		301								???	Eeek——																						
75	75		301									The empty buildings made the sound extra crisp and clear. Out of reflection, Bianca looked up, trying to figure out where it came from.																						
76	76		301									She then saw it in the direction of the sun.																						
77	77		201							1	500312																							
78	78		301							1		It was a crane-like mechanoid, standing on the ruins slightly higher above. Its long, svelte neck curved naturally between its wings. To Bianca, it looked like a believer making silent prayers.	1																					
79	79		301									It then slowly raised its head, so it could see Bianca standing down below.																						
80	80		201							1	500128																							
81	81		301							1	Bianca	Combat Unit Booster sighted inside the building. No visible damage found. It is not displaying intention to relocate.	1																					
82	82		202							1					1																			
83	83		301								Comms	N-now I understand why you are the leader of the Purifying Force... N-no wonder the CTO specifically allocated you to this task.																						
84	84		201							1	500128																							
85	85		301							1	Bianca	Thank you.	1																					
86	86		202							1					1																			
87	87		301							1	Comms	I will let other squads in the area know, but "Toniris" is still unstable. Please keep it under control.	1																					
88	88		201							1	500128																							
89	89		301							1	Bianca	...What do I need to do?	1																					
90	90		202							1					1																			
91	91		301								Comms	Just treat it like any other animal. Let it know that you are safe and won't hurt it...																						
92	92		301								Comms	...And connect to it if possible! If you can form a connection, it will never run again!																						
93	93		301									...The comms ended abruptly. The coordinator must be calling other squads.																						
94	94		201							1	500128																							
95	95		301							1	Bianca	To make it feel that I'm safe... Like this?	1																					
96	96		301									Bianca carefully reached out for "Toniris", who was high above.																						
97	97		201							1	500312																							
98	98		301							1	Toniris	—?	1																					
99	99		301									Toniris stretches its neck. Its bill gently taps on Bianca's hand. Although it is not showing any signs of obedience, it does not look rebellious or aggressive either.																						
100	100		202							1					1																			
101	101		301									Unlike what Asimov described, Toniris is not disturbed by Bianca's presence. She knew her best bet was to initiate a connection immediately.																						
102	102		301									————Tactical connection process commencing. Establishing handshake protocol————																						
103	103		301									————Connection failed!————																						
104	104		201							1	500128	21																						
105	105		301							1		Bianca felt her Inver-Device burning after hearing the warning sound.																						
106	106		301								Bianca	Ouch...! So this is what a connection failure feels like...	1																					
107	107		204							1																								
108	108		301									Hoping to "calm it down" again, Bianca reached out for Toniris one more time—																						
109	109		202							1					1																			
110	110		201							1	500312																							
111	111		301							1		—But it does not want to come in contact this time. Instead, it flies away and lands at a higher place.																						
112	112		301									At which point, Bianca finally managed to have a good view of the entire ruin.																						
113	113		301									Under Toniris was a high wall with inlaid stained glass. The religious-themed pattern showed it was once a church.																						
114	114		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Toniris just happened to be standing on where the statue used to be. The sun rained down through the shattered ceiling, engulfing it.
