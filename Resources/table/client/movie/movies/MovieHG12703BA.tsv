7	7		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You have lost track of time, but the pain still lingers on your forehead. You feel the soft mattress on your back. The pendant lamp above you sways from the breeze.																						
8	8		401							1	5																							
9	9		302								It is a familiar ceiling.	10																						
10	10		301									You seem to have returned to the same bedroom. The interior looks no different, and you are wearing an identical, casual outfit.																						
11	11		301									But unlike last time, it is a sunny day outside. The alarm clock reads 08:00.																						
12	12		301									And Nanami is still not in the room.																						
13	13		301									"Knock-knock."																						
14	14		301									You hear a light knocking sound on the door. After smoothing out the wrinkles on your clothes, you walk to the door and put your hand on the handle—																						
15	15		301								Nanami	Comm... Senior 【kuroname】, are you awake?																						
16	16		301									The voice sends a chill up your spine. All your muscles immediately contract, stopping your hand from turning the handle.																						
17	17		301									You finally understand what Nanami meant by "playing your role."																						
18	18		302								(So this is what we're doing now.)	19																						
19	19		301									You calm yourself and open the door. The girl before you is wearing a dress and standing calmly.																						
20	20		201							1	500038	7																						
21	21		301							1	Nanami	Huh, you are already awake. I was going to ambush you.	1																					
22	22		204							1	14																							
23	23		301								Nanami	What a pity...	1																					
24	24		302								...	25																						
25	25		302								Put the chainsaw down first. Show some decency.	26	When you say ambush, do you mean dismantling me with that?	32																				
26	26		204							1																								
27	27		301								Nanami	Okay.	1																					
28	28		401							2	561																							
29	29		301									The chainsaw is almost half of Nanami's height, but she tosses it away with ease. It hits the floor and makes a dull noise.																						
30	30		204							1	14																							
31	31	36	301								Nanami	Now I can't see Comm—eh... Senior 【kuroname】's sleeping face.	1																					
32	32		204							1																								
33	33		301								Nanami	No, I only wanted to use the chainsaw to open the door.	1																					
34	34		204							1	2																							
35	35		301								Nanami	By ambush... I mean to look at Comm... um, Senior 【kuroname】's sleeping face.	1																					
36	36		302								I never sleep in.	37																						
37	37		301									You are a soldier after all. You follow strict daily routines.																						
38	38		204							1																								
39	39		301								Nanami	I see.	1																					
40	40		301									Nanami takes more notes on the holo-screen.																						
41	41		301								Nanami	Let's go to school, Comm... um, Senior 【kuroname】.	1																					
42	42		301									Before that, there is still a question that bothers you—																						
43	43		302								Why are you playing a freshman this time?	44																						
44	44		204							1	2																							
45	45		301								Nanami	Because Nanami wants to experience it!	1																					
46	46		301									It is indeed a very Nanami-like answer. Still—																						
47	47		302								You can't even get used to it yourself.	48																						
48	48		302								I think you should give up that setting.	49																						
49	49		204							1																								
50	50		301								Nanami	But this is what I planned...	1																					
51	51		302								I think you should follow your heart.	52																						
52	52		301								Nanami	Hmm...	1																					
53	53		204							1	1																							
54	54		301								Nanami	Commandant, you're right. Nanami prefers this more.	1																					
55	55		301									Seeing Nanami no longer insists on calling you "Senior," you feel relieved. At least you don't have to call her "Freshman Nanami".																						
56	56		302								Let's go then.	57																						
57	57		204							1	7																							
58	58		301								Nanami	Huh? Where are we going?	1																					
59	59		301									Were you not going to school?																						
60	60		204							1																								
61	61		301								Nanami	Oh, that's already over.	1																					
62	62		301									Over?																						
63	63		301								Nanami	Nanami only wanted to be your junior, Commandant. After the morning call, that experience is over.	1																					
64	64		301								Nanami	Nanami didn't get to break into your bedroom or use the chainsaw as planned, but that was the end of the story.	1																					
65	65		301									Is "break into" literal?																						
66	66		301								Nanami	After arriving at school, we will be separated based on grades. Then your "classmates" will have a chance to hit on you.	1																					
67	67		301								Nanami	I won't let that happen!	1																					
68	68		301									Nanami crosses her arms, making a giant "X" sign.																						
69	69		301								Nanami	Besides, school is so boring. I'm not going there.	1																					
70	70		301									Don't look down on school!																						
71	71		301								Nanami	Let's move on to the next experience, Commandant!	1																					
72	72		302								How many are there?	73																						
73	73		204							1	1																							
74	74		301								Nanami	This—many—	1																					
75	75		301									Nanami taps her screen open, and you see a long, almost infinite string of numbers.																						
76	76		302								That's too many!	77	Will I ever live to finish them?	77																				
77	77		301									Is the number still increasing down there?																						
78	78		204							1	2																							
79	79		301								Nanami	Don't worry! I've got a plan!	1																					
80	80		301								Nanami	And you don't have to worry about time. Time passes much faster here than in real life.	1																					
81	81		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Nanami	Enough with this. Let's go!	1

85	85		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Nanami grabs your hand, and your vision blurs for a second before the scenery in front of you transforms from a bedroom to an amusement park. Not to mention...																						
86	86		201							1	500038																							
87	87		301							1	Nanami	Does it feel familiar, Commandant?	1																					
88	88		204							1	1																							
89	89		301								Nanami	That's right! This is the abandoned park we visited before—	1																					
90	90		204							1	2																							
91	91		301								Nanami	Except Nanami has fixed everything here!	1																					
92	92		301								Nanami	Now, we can play through everything for once!	1																					
93	93		202							1					1																			
94	94		301									The park before you no longer looks deserted and neglected, just as Nanami said. All the facilities have been repaired and renovated.																						
95	95		301									The Ferris wheel is spinning, the rollercoaster soaring past you. A clown robot is waving at you in front of the door to the haunted house.																						
96	96		301									The metal, plastic, and fabrics have all been coated with new colors by Nanami, who has reconstructed the magical kingdom before your very eyes.																						
97	97		301									Except—																						
98	98		302								(My spider sense is tingling...)	99																						
99	99		201							1	500038	2																						
100	100		301								Nanami	Commandant, let's ride the carousel!	1																					
101	101		301									Nanami leads you to the carousel. You pick a random horse and hop on.																						
102	102		301									Nanami, meanwhile, jumps on behind you, wrapping her arms around your waist.																						
103	103		302								N-Nanami?!	104																						
104	104		204							1	1																							
105	105		301								Nanami	It's about to start, Commandant. Remember to hold on tight!	1																					
106	106		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Right as she says that, the horses start moving.																						
107	107		204							1																								
108	108		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Nanami	Your heart is racing as well, Commandant.	1																					
109	109		202							1					1																			
110	110		301									Holding you close, Nanami seems to be listening to your heartbeat. When she speaks, her breath is carried through your clothes, caressing your back.																						
111	111		301									But you do not have time to pay attention to that—																						
112	112		301									It is not an exaggeration to say that your heart has never beaten as fast as it does right now your entire life.																						
113	113		301									After all—

115	115		401							2	968																							
116	116		301									The horse you are riding is currently traversing through the air at 500 kilometers per hour. This is a bona fide panoramic flight experience.																						
117	117		302								(So, "fixed" means it can now fly!)	118																						
118	118		301									The turbulence dissuades you from talking. The freezing wind hits your face like needles piercing through your skin, threatening to tear your face off your skull. You can only hold on tight in case you are thrown off.																						
119	119		201							1	500038	1																						
120	120		301							1	Nanami	Hahaha! You also find this fun, don't you, Commandant?	1																					
121	121		301								Nanami	Humans' heart rates rise when they're excited. Given how fast your heart is beating, you must find this super fun!	1																					
122	122		302								Wabibabobabiaulawoye...	123																						
123	123		301									Your refutation scrambles in the wind, turning into gibberish.																						
124	124		204							1	2																							
125	125		301								Nanami	In that case, let Nanami make this even more fun!	1

133	133		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You are not sure how it is designed, but the horse eventually returns to its original position steadily and stops. You try your hardest not to fall when you get off it, your legs trembling and weak.

135	135		301							1	Nanami	How are you feeling, Commandant?	1																					
136	136		302								It was too exciting...	137																						
137	137		302								But it was very stress-relieving as well.	138																						
138	138		301									Dopamine took over your brain after the initial terror passed, and your fatigue from working the past few days has all but vanished.																						
139	139		204							1	2																							
140	140		301								Nanami	We have to do the rollercoaster next. Then the haunted house, the Ferris wheel, the bumper cars...	1																					
141	141		301									Your face grows paler with every new attraction Nanami names. You do not dare to imagine in what ways Nanami has "fixed" them.																						
142	142		301									But seeing her enthusiasm as she counts them with her fingers, you do not have the heart to reject her.																						
143	143		302		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				At least let me take a break first.
