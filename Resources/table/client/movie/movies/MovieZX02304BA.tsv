4	4		301									Someone with a guitar sits among several like-minded musicians, strumming weakly.																						
5	5		301									Someone takes out a pair of cards that were almost crumpled and slickly tosses them in front of their comrade's bed.																						
6	6		301									Someone rummages through their pants pocket, searching desperately for a bit of wheat lost between the stitches.																						
7	7		301									Someone knows that they are dying of a terminal disease, and have given their rations away to others for the past several days.																						
8	8		301									Someone lies down in a damp corner, weeping for the relatives they just buried.																						
9	9		301									While most ignore the passing time, the dim light outside, and the continuous rain.																						
10	10		301									They look at the old mottled ceiling. Their eyes had lost their light, leaving only an empty silence.																						
11	11		301									But despair will not stop growing in those who raise their hands and surrender.																						
12	12		301									Liv routinely checks the condition of all the wounded, and unconsciously rubs her aching chest. With the lack of maintenance chambers, she hasn't rested for many days.																						
13	13		301									During a search and rescue mission, Liv's leg was seriously injured while protecting her target.																						
14	14		301									However, in order to leave medical supplies for refugees to come, she only splints her broken leg and refrains from fully repairing it.																						
15	15		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					But she is by no means an exception. Both people and Constructs alike are forced to stand on a sinking island. No one can be spared.

28	28		301									A man and a woman rush to the gap in the insolation door. The woman's long hair and clothes are well kept as if they have been carefully cleaned recently.																						
29	29		301									The other man beside her, holding a child covered in blood, seems a little familiar.

51	51		301							1	Familiar Man	Thank you.	1																					
52	52		301									He nods in thanks and gently sets the child down on the folding bed. Stanley turns and leans against the corner with a gloomy expression as if lost in thought.

70	70		301								Liv	Alright. Looks like we need a serum.	1																					
71	71		301								Liv	What has he eaten the past few days?	1																					
72	72		301								Familiar Man	I don't know. He said he hadn't found any food the past few days and was starving last night, so he wanted a pack of my biscuits.	3

82	82		301								Stanley	...Why?	1																					
83	83		301								Stanley	Why would you let him go alone? Your backpack is obviously full of supplies. Why would you let a child risk his life?	1																					
84	84		301									The man is caught off guard by the sudden question. He turns and looks closely at the boy standing in front of him, then frowns as if remembering something.

86	86		204							2	14																							
87	87		301								Refugee Woman	Sorry, it's because of me... I'm pregnant and sprained my ankle. I can't walk that fast. The child said he wanted to go with the others, so he left early... I didn't think he would...	2																					
88	88		301									She sighs and looks at the child on the fold-up cot. Without any anesthesia, he cries in pain while Liv sutures his wound.

100	100		301								Stanley	Then why... get pregnant?	1

107	107		301								Refugee Woman	...	2																					
108	108		301									The woman wasn't expecting to be asked this question by such a young boy. Just as she opens her mouth to respond, she suddenly stops herself.																						
109	109		301								Stanley	He's lucky you found him and brought him to such a kind doctor.	1																					
110	110		301								Stanley	But what in the future? He's going to be just like me... Or worse.	1																					
111	111		201							1	500413		-450																					
112	112		301							1	Matches	(Whimpers)	1																					
113	113		301								Familiar Man	Why do you say that?	3																					
114	114		301								Stanley	Why...? Because my parents were just like you.	1																					
115	115		301								Stanley	They had me without thinking about the future. As soon as they couldn't raise me, they just kicked me to the side of the road.	1																					
116	116		301								Refugee Woman	...Without thinking about the future?	2																					
117	117		301								Stanley	Exactly. You have a child on the way. You know what I'm talking about.	1																					
118	118		301								Stanley	Refugees and conservation areas give preferential treatment to expecting parents and those with children.	1																					
119	119		301								Refugee Woman	...	2																					
120	120		301									She lowers her head, not denying the boy's accusation.																						
121	121		301								Stanley	I know they have good intentions...	1																					
122	122		301								Stanley	But some people like to take advantage of this. Just like my parents...	1																					
123	123		301								Stanley	They just used these good intentions for their own benefit without considering the future.	1																					
124	124		301								Stanley	...After my mom was pregnant, they were given special admission into the conservation area, where they had me and my brother.	1																					
125	125		301								Stanley	When I was two years old... My dad "gave" me to another family for a bowl of porridge.	1																					
126	126		301								Stanley	My adoptive father turned out to be just like him, too. He was just freeloading on the sympathy of others and would use me to get supplies from the conservation area.	1																					
127	127		301								Stanley	But no matter which "parents" I was with, they would only ever give me the scraps.	1																					
128	128		301								Stanley	Once I got a little bigger and lost this "privilege," they threw me by the roadside just like those empty cans they finished eating.	1																					
129	129		301								Refugee Woman	...How could they do such a thing?	2																					
130	130		301									Hearing Stanley speak, the surrounding refugees begin to whisper to each other.

136	136		301								Refugee 5	How are they bastards? Without them, who'd dare to have children in a world like this?																						
137	137		301								Refugee 6	They don't look into who the child belongs to and just give out supplies.																						
138	138		301								Refugee 7	How can they? And can you guarantee you'd be alive tomorrow? If someone's alive to take care of a child, that's all that matters.

140	140		201							1	500413																							
141	141		301							1	Stanley	...But have you ever thought about it? How can abandoned children survive on the side of the road?	1																					
142	142		301								Stanley	Being a burden on others, banished from conservation areas, and cursed at...	1																					
143	143		301								Stanley	So... I want to ask you, as a parent, why would you have a child if you can't take care of them?	1																					
144	144		301								Stanley	Are you just looking for short-term benefits? Or is it because you don't care about your child's future?	1																					
145	145		201							1	500393	14																						
146	146		301							1	Refugee Woman	...	1																					
147	147		301									She hangs her head in silence, unable to come up with an answer. Silence fills the depressing air until the familiar man coughs quietly.																						
148	148		201							1	500262																							
149	149		301							1	Familiar Man	Sorry. This isn't an answer, but...	1																					
150	150		301								Familiar Man	...I'm not the child's father.	1																					
151	151		301								Familiar Man	And, of course, she isn't his mother.	1																					
152	152		301								Familiar Man	Her husband and I used to be merchants... Our profession is much more dangerous now, but some are still willing to take the risk.	1																					
153	153		301								Familiar Man	Half of the supplies belonged to her husband... And I can't go eating someone else's food, now can I?	1																					
154	154		301									Stanley's eyes widen at the unexpected answer.																						
155	155		201							1	500413																							
156	156		301							1	Stanley	S-sorry. I didn't realize...	1

161	161		301								Refugee Woman	We aren't his parents, but I heard him say that he had a similar experience as your own. His biological parents died in an accident two years ago when he was only eight years old.	2																					
162	162		301								Refugee Woman	None of us can be sure that we'll live to see tomorrow in this cruel world, let alone stay together with our children.	2																					
163	163		301								Refugee Woman	And, of course, we can't guarantee a safe upbringing for our children...	2																					
164	164		301								Stanley	Okay...	1																					
165	165		301									She slowly walks up and sits down next to Stanley, then gently pats him on the back with one hand and rubs Matches' fluffy head with the other.																						
166	166		301								Refugee Woman	...It's so hard for children to even just stay alive when they're separated from their parents at such a young age...	2																					
167	167		301								Refugee Woman	I will consider what you said carefully and be sure to make the right decision...	2																					
168	168		301								Stanley	...Okay.	1																					
169	169		301								Refugee 7	(Sighs) Enough with this crap. Isn't it obvious? If you have a child, you should raise them. Everyone is faced with hardship in this cruel world. We're all equal here. No point in complaining.																						
170	170		301								Stanley	...Sorry.	1																					
171	171		301								Refugee Woman	No need to apologize.	2																					
172	172		301								Refugee Woman	The world is full of injustice.	2																					
173	173		301									She looks at everyone, then slowly closes her eyes.																						
174	174		301								Refugee Woman	We're all struggling with the same adversities, but some people are armed and some people can move freely. Others... carry lives yet to be born and others are forced to run before they can walk.	2																					
175	175		301								Refugee Woman	It's amazing if you can survive in this world and save another life.	2																					
176	176		301								Refugee 7	Alright, it's my fault. I just don't want to see everyone looking down in the dumps. It's hard enough to have a new born life only to get kicked back.																						
177	177		301									He turns his back to the refugee woman and Stanley with a little indignation.

190	190		301								Liv	The arrival of a new life should be a joyful thing, but we don't want to give each other a burden beyond our means.	1																					
191	191		301								Stanley	...You're right.	2																					
192	192		301								Liv	Even still... This difficulty can also be rewarding.	1																					
193	193		301								Liv	By that, I don't just mean getting supplies using the kindness of others, but hope and dependence.	1

198	198		301								Liv	But by doing so, your life has become more difficult and has made your food even more scarce.	1																					
199	199		301								Liv	But as you said, he gives your life meaning and motivation. That's why you made the choice... Right?	1																					
200	200		301								Stanley	...Yeah.	2

212	212		301								Refugee 8	If there are only a few living people left in this land, what good are more supplies? This world won't be so lonely with more lives around.																						
213	213		301								Refugee 7	Yeah! That's what I mean.																						
214	214		301									Hearing this, he immediately turns around excitedly and claps his hands.																						
215	215		301								Refugee 7	Whether it's a person or a dog, you need to protect them as their mom. You can't be so quick to give up... Ugh, there I go running my mouth again...																						
216	216		301									He gently pats himself on the face in apology. Stanley and the woman in the crowd laugh at his "motherly instinct" kicking in.																						
217	217		301								Refugee 7	Sorry, I've never been too good at talking with others.																						
218	218		301									He rubs his hands with a kind smile. The dust from his hands causes him to sneeze a couple of times.																						
219	219		301								Refugee 7	Well, since you're already here, how about changing the subject? What's your name? Where did you come from? How's the situation outside?																						
220	220		301									Every new refugee always gets asked, "Where did you come from" and "what's the situation outside". So much so, they've become the standard greeting. Even if they don't answer at first, they will be asked in private.

233	233		301									Hearing this, the refugees begin to whisper amongst each other.																						
234	234		301								Refugee 4	I thought it would be safest to the south. Looks like it's just more of the same suffering. There may not be those twins, but there are just as many Hetero-Creatures!																						
235	235		301								Refugee 5	Guess it's not safe here anymore. We need to evacuate ASAP!

237	237		301							1	Old Lady	Evacuate? Where else is there to go?	1																					
238	238		301								Old Lady	Are there any safe places left out there?	1																					
239	239		301								Refugee 6	Then what else should we do?																						
240	240		301								Old Lady	If Babylonia doesn't send any more support, what about the Forsaken?	1

244	244		301								Fantine	Actually, this gentleman came from the Forsaken.	2

247	247		301							1	Familiar Man	I don't know them too well, but I've done business with them as a merchant.	2																					
248	248		301								Familiar Man	They're still sheltering refugees, but every base is already overcrowded.	2																					
249	249		301								Old Lady	...Looks like we need to think about evacuating.	1																					
250	250		301								Familiar Man	They're still in a better position than most conservation areas. At least they have food reserves. But given this environment, they're in desperate need of serum.	2																					
251	251		301								Familiar Man	I came here to see if I could find any spare serum in the conservation areas to exchange with them.	2																					
252	252		301								Old Lady	...Exchange?	1																					
253	253		301								Old Lady	You mentioned her husband is also a merchant. What about him?	1																					
254	254		201							2	500393		-400	-50	50																			
255	255		301								Fantine	He fell into the Red Tide while protecting me... The last I heard his voice, he was already...	2																					
256	256		301								Fantine	I know he isn't alive anymore, but the Hetero-Sapien sounded just like him...	2																					
257	257		301								Fantine	If this gentleman hadn't come here to pick up goods, I would have been... torn to pieces by those Hetero-Sapiens.	2																					
258	258		301								Old Lady	Seems like you've had your fair share of experience with those monsters.	1																					
259	259		301									The old lady nods in recognition.																						
260	260		301								Old Lady	What's your name, young man?	1																					
261	261		201							2	500262		-400

271	271		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The first time she heard this name was before they encountered the Polyphage.																						
272	272		301									Gray Raven had received a new mission that required them to search the coordinates left by Huaxu in the "Deserted Ruins". She had accidentally stumbled across a book while searching for clues.

274	274		301							1	Liv	"Cardman Rider Genesis"...?	1																					
275	275		301									She carefully opened the faded cover. After reading the whole story, she found a line of a beautifully written message written on the back cover.

286	286		301							1	Liv	How very inspiring.	1																					
287	287		301								Liv	It looks kind of new as well. Could one of the Scavengers have written this?	1																					
288	288		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					A hazily written "of course" can be seen below the slogan. There seems to be something else after these two words, but they have been roughly scrubbed off.

310	310		301								Shrek	Also the Serum. He was originally tasked with exchanging supplies. But since he hadn't returned in a long time, I went to look for him.	2
