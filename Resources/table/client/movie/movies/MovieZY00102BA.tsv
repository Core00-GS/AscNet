7	5		301								Lucia	It's also divided into clearly-defined zones. I wonder how many mechanoids have gathered here.	2																					
8	6		301								Lee	My initial estimation is over a thousand of them. After all, maintaining a hologram of this scale must involve an enormous amount of recon drones.	3																					
9	7		302								Who organizes this?	8	Can't believe there's so many mechanoid here.	10																				
10	8	9	301								Lee	It could be Foreman, it could be others, but from my experience, a convention of this nature is usually run collectively by the fans.	3																					
11	9	1003	301								Liv	Foreman did say they all enjoy Ghost Expert here.	1																					
12	1353		301								Lee	Even with the results from our database, it's still difficult to determine what this Ghost Expert is...																						
13	10	1003	301								Lee	Anyway, we should definitely look into a group this size. We might just get our hands on some useful intel.	3

18	12		301								Mechanoid B	We can always give it another go later. Let's try the other trials first to liven things up.	2																					
19	13		301								Mechanoid A	I'm gonna give that East General a taste of my fist after the event's over. Just you wait!	1

23	15		301								Lucia	Looks like they're contestants who did the trial before us. Should we ask them how it went, Commandant?	2																					
24	1008		302								That's not necessary.	16	Let's ask them.	17																				
25	16	1013	301								Lucia	Copy. Then let's keep going.	2																					
26	17	18	301								Lucia	Understood.	2

33	20	21	301								Lucia	We're also participants in this competition. We're just wondering if you can tell us a little bit about the content of the trial?	1																					
34	21	22	301								Mechanoid A	Won't hurt to tell you what it is, I suppose. Basically, it's a game of riddles.	2																					
35	22	23	301								Lucia	Are they riddles that challenge our knowledge base?	1																					
36	23	24	301								Mechanoid A	It's a challenge on how well you know your companions. Speaking of which—how the hell did you not notice that guy's a fake?	2																					
37	24	25	301								Mechanoid B	Hey, stop hitting me!	3																					
38	25	26	301									Halfway through your conversation, one of the mechanoids starts smacking the other one, and you feel like this is as much information as you can get from them.

52	32		301								East General	Regardless, I should provide you with a little more information before you begin.	1																					
53	33		301								East General	Apart from the Northern trial, all the other trials only permit one participant each time, and those who have taken part in a previous trial cannot join another one.	1																					
54	34		301								East General	Considering that you're a group of Constructs with a commandant, I'll allow your commandant to assist you through your comms.	1																					
55	1020		302								Thanks.	35	Wouldn't that be unfair?	36																				
56	35	1023	301								East General	Sure.	1																					
57	36	1021	301								East General	Given that you Constructs only work well with a commandant and that you're all new to this... Consider this a newcomer gift.	1

64	39		301								East General	But you certainly won't be fooled by such trickery as outstanding Taoists yourselves! Therefore, I, East General, shall test your perception!	1
