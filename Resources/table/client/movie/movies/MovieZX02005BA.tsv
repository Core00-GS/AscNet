4	4		301									But unlike how he described it, the vehicles are hardly "parked" outside—they are stacked together haphazardly, like a child leaving toys behind. You wonder how Noctis managed to pull a functional car from this pile.

20	20		301									Before you can stop her, No. 21 fires her laser cannon toward the window, tearing a wide hole in the car, revealing the empty seats inside with the shattered glass.

33	33		301									No. 21 knocks over a stack of folders when she enters, and they fall all over the floor. A monitor terminal on the desk seems to be awakened by the commotion as it turns on and shows a video of a football game.																						
34	34		302								Power is still running in the town at minimum capacity?	35																						
35	35		301									The top right corner of the display writes "REC", as if the owner of the terminal left the seat in the station for some reason, leaving behind the game recorded the night before and played during work.

57	57		301									At the same time, an intense sentiment is prickling you, reminding you of how intimate and trusting you are of the safety this place has provided. The nostalgia is so intense that you can feel your heart aching.

64	64		301									The loud noises surround the whole precinct, untraceable. Meanwhile, the blurry figure appears again by the window.

68	68		301									You hear a child's laughter on the other side. No. 21 puts her hand on the window, and the feverish image clears up—a young girl in twintails, no more than five years old, has her back facing you outside, looking up.																						
69	69		301								Eerie Girl?	...Dad isn't in the car...																						
70	70		301								Eerie Girl?	...When is Dad leaving work?

80	80		301									Failing to locate her target, No. 21 looks around, stupefied.																						
81	81		301								No. 21	What was that? A new enemy?	1																					
82	82		302								...I don't know.	83																						
83	83		301									The only thing you are certain of right now is that, for some reason, Vera could not see what you saw, despite being connected as well, but No. 21 can.																						
84	84		301									You cannot say if this is why Kurono wants you here... Have they done something to you? Is this the doing of the "third party"? Or have you been hallucinating, somehow transmitting your hallucination to No. 21?																						
85	85		302								Let's get out of here.	86																						
86	86		301									Regardless, you have no way to tackle it right now. You can only move forward.

96	94		302								A birthday party?	95																						
97	95		301									You immediately recognize that she is asking about what the eerie girl mentioned.																						
98	96		302								It's a celebration of a person's birthday.	97

146	141		301									A few masked and armed Constructs in bulletproof vests are here as well, making the small room even more claustrophobic. In your hazy vision, you can see they have their weapons pointed at your face.																						
147	142		301									After making sure that you are not going to go berserk and attack them, the Constructs calmly step back and leave the room.																						
148	143		301									You slowly sit up on your chair, your back feeling like it has been run over by Asslam as your bone aches and cracks. Your ribs are still hurting from the injury you received in the sewer.																						
149	144		301									The chains on your ankles clang along your movement.																						
150	145		301									You peek around you to find the same depressing room with your reflection on the same piece of glass. The small window to the outside is now closed, and Rebecca is gone, leaving only a roomful of Construct soldiers.

170	165		301								Noctis	Alright, alright.																						
171	166		301									This is... surveillance.																						
172	167		301									No... this is a warning. Your every move is being monitored. Despite knowing this from the beginning, you cannot help but look up and meet the silent gaze behind the narrow window.

181	176		301								Rebecca	For some reason, we lost all signals on 21, and the Cerberus captain couldn't connect to her comms either. She just vanished like a snuffed candle.	1																					
182	177		301								Rebecca	Since you were connected, you were also forced to disconnect, bypassing the system and stressing your mind. Others would've been out for hours, but your condition means we've only lost 13 minutes and 26 seconds.	1																					
183	178		301								Rebecca	We're progressing nicely.	1																					
184	179		302								Progressing nicely?	180																						
185	180		301								Rebecca	You seemed to have found some interesting leads, didn't you? I noticed that you had stayed for quite some time at an unrelated location.	1																					
186	181		301									She is trying to fish information out of you.																						
187	182		302								I would've reported in if I found interesting leads.	183																						
188	183		301								Rebecca	Fine. Given the situation, the plan's changed. Vera seems to be in trouble, so you'll be connecting with her. After you deal with that, you'll return to where the leads were and continue your investigation.	1																					
189	184		302								What about 21?	185																						
190	185		301								Rebecca	Our guys are investigating why she was disconnected. Just prioritize your mission.	1																					
191	186		301									Kurono's intention is clear. They just want you to work like a mule as fast as you possibly can.

196	191		204							1																								
197	192		301								Rebecca	The only term for you leaving this place is obeying our order. Do you not understand that?	1																					
198	193		302								I have a better offer.	194																						
199	194		301									Vera is skilled—she could not have simply gotten lost. But the fact remains that even she did not have time to search for No. 21 in Kurono's recording.																						
200	195		301									—More importantly, you need No. 21. You are not sure why yet, but she is the only one who can feel, hear, and see those eerie "illusions."																						
201	196		302								Let me connect with 21.	197																						
202	197		301									The Parliament's condition is to "keep the commandant safe," and members of the Task Force are not included. Given how relentless Kurono is, it is highly possible that they would abandon their search on No. 21.																						
203	198		302								As long as her M.I.N.D. is working, my Mind Beacon will find her.	199																						
204	199		302								I can do what your machines can't.	200																						
205	200		301								Rebecca	It'll just burden you and waste our time.	1																					
206	201		301								Rebecca	Isn't this the first time you have connected to this Construct? Let me tell you a secret—the Cerberus Commandant has never connected with 21 before. Do you know why?	1																					
207	202		302								I don't know.	204	I don't care.	203																				
208	203		301								Rebecca	You know what I care about? I care if you can finish your mission, and you should care if you can leave this place alive. Getting what we both want requires the same thing—we're on the same side, not opposite, not now.	1																					
209	204		301								Rebecca	You don't know this Construct as well as we do. Our data shows that her M.I.N.D. has never been stable. Connecting with her was risky in the first place.	1

230	225		301								Rebecca	...Commandant, are you losing your mind?	1																					
231	226		302								I meant I saw something strange in that neighborhood.	227																						
232	227		204							1	4																							
233	228		301								Rebecca	Why didn't you report it?	1																					
234	229		301									The smile fades from Rebecca's projection as she shifts her posture and leans forward.																						
235	230		302								I wasn't sure why I could see them...	231																						
236	231		301									Your mouth goes dry at the absurdity of reporting a haunting to your superiors.																						
237	232		302								But 21 could see them too.	233																						
238	233		302								I don't know why. Maybe she's special.	234																						
239	234		204							1																								
240	235		301									Rebecca pauses for a second before smiling again. The image of the woman who has been threatening you has completely vanished.																						
241	236		301								Rebecca	...Very well. I see.	1																					
242	237		301								Rebecca	Operator, follow what the commandant said and act accordingly.	1																					
243	238		301								Adjustment Operator	But... the device was overloaded in the accident. Considering the maximum threshold of the commandant's Mind Beacon, it's best to only connect to one Construct...																						
244	239		301								Rebecca	You heard him, Commandant.	1																					
245	240		302								...I understand.	241																						
246	241		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Adjustment Operator	Okay, then. Prepare to connect. Please put on the remote connection device.

250	245		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Your Mind Beacon traverses through muddy consciousnesses like a fish swimming deep in the ocean.																						
251	246		301									You soon find a dot of light in front. Unlike your connection with Vera, it is weak—a frail, cold glow.																						
252	247		301									Too frail... Your head hurts.																						
253	248		301									Managing your breaths, you concentrate, your will steadfast.																						
254	249		301									The Mind Beacon opens up from a thread to a net, interweaving and expanding gently.																						
255	250		301									The weak glow skips around, trembling, seemingly trying to escape. Weak and obscured it may be, it is still whole.																						
256	251		301									You struggle to catch it to reveal its entirety, but your efforts have been in vain. The stress on your mind over time has almost depleted your mental prowess.																						
257	252		301									No... you cannot give up yet. Just try a little harder—you reach out, your attempt as futile as trying to touch the unreachable sky. But you do not give up.																						
258	253		301									In the infinite ocean of the M.I.N.D., you keep walking on the endless path.																						
259	254		301									And you grab that waning light.

265	260		301			RImgBg1Shake					No. 21	Urgh! Ah!																						
266	261		301									The pain slowly subsides as you refamiliarize with the sensation, and you find yourself back in the town. In your blurry vision, you can tell that you are indoors.																						
267	262		302								Thank goodness you're safe.	263																						
268	263		301								No. 21	Stay away...																						
269	264		301									No. 21 stumbles and sits down with a dreadful expression, surrounded by fallen, orb-shaped mechanoids and Medic Bots that look like her Co-Bot.																						
270	789		301									Like an animal, No. 21 has her arms by her body, her back bent, and she growls quietly like a wild beast. You have no doubt that she would have bitten you if you were standing before her physically.																						
271	265		301								No. 21	Stay... away from me!																						
272	266		301									Her jaw is trembling as well, muddling her words.																						
273	267		301									She is hurt. Bandages drenched in vital fluid lie on the tiled floor next to a half-empty bottle of isopropyl alcohol. You faintly see the wound on her abdomen, the soaked wraps failing to stop her from "bleeding."																						
274	268		301									She seems to have been trying to patch herself up.																						
275	269		302								Listen to me, 21.	270																						
276	270		301								No. 21	Get out of my head—																						
277	271		302								You shouldn't be using that... That is for human...	272																						
278	272		301									She keeps repeating her grumbly command. There seems to be a black fog lurking at the edge of the light, ready to devour her at a moment's notice.																						
279	273		302								You know me, 21.	274	Something's wrong with you, 21... What happened?	274																				
280	274		302								I'm not going to hurt you.	275	Vera lost your signal.	276

283	277	279	301								No. 21	...【kuroname】?																						
284	278		301								No. 21	...Capt.?																						
285	279		301									Your words seem to work. The hostility she is displaying has slightly relaxed, and she seems less tense.																						
286	280		301									It has taken almost twenty seconds. Silent, No. 21 does not clutch her fist nor command Buddy to attack. She seems to have been trapped inside a trance, stuck with a question she cannot answer, and so she does not.																						
287	281		301									The black fog dissipates, not disappearing completely, retreating to somewhere not far behind you. But it is far enough from her for now, and she is safe from being immediately devoured.																						
288	282		301								No. 21	...																						
289	283		301								No. 21	...【kuroname】, is that you... inside my head?																						
290	284		302								It is.	285	I'm sorry.	285																				
291	285		301								No. 21	What have you done to me...?	1																					
292	286		302								...? I haven't done anything.	287	I've connected with you.	287																				
293	287		301									She looks left, and right, and left again—until she is shaking her head violently as if trying to get rid of the voice in her head.																						
294	288		301								No. 21	I don't want you.																						
295	289		301									All you can do is maintain your focus amidst all the pain and tiredness, controlling your Mind Beacon and reducing the sense of invasion as much as you can.																						
296	290		301								No. 21	Capt...																						
297	291		302								I can't connect with Vera for now.	292	We have to look for Vera ourselves.	292																				
298	292		301								No. 21	Have to find... Capt.																						
299	293		301									No. 21 mumbles to herself and briefly quiets down. Despite feeling her rejection, you can feel the connection stabilizing.																						
300	294		301									She... does not trust you. Even though you have connected before, her attitude has not softened. In fact, it has gotten even odder. The hallucinations seemed to have affected her quite a bit.																						
301	295		301								No. 21	I hate strangers inside here.																						
302	296		301									She points at her head.																						
303	297		302								I won't probe your M.I.N.D., I swear.	298																						
304	298		301									This is the best you can promise, anyway.																						
305	299		301								No. 21	Okay.																						
306	300		301									She replies concisely, her tone suggesting that she will terminate the connection forcefully if you make her feel uneasy.																						
307	301		301								No. 21	I'll listen to you for now.																						
308	302		302								Let's treat your wound first.	303																						
309	303		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				No. 21	...Okay.

312	306		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		After stopping the bleeding with a frost patch, No. 21 asks you again.																						
313	307		301								No. 21	What do we do now?	1																					
314	308		302								Investigate the coordinates.	309	Rendezvous with Vera and Noctis.	309																				
315	309		301								No. 21	Complete the mission, then we'll find Capt.	1																					
316	310		302								Did anything happen when we were disconnected?	311																						
317	311		301								No. 21	I followed my orders and arrived here, finding traces of battle.	1																					
318	312		302								Traces of battle?	313																						
319	313		301								No. 21	Yes. And then headache. I don't know what happened.	1																					
320	314		302								Just to be safe, let's look around this place once more.	315																						
321	315		301								No. 21	Okay.	1																					
322	316		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					She answers quietly. Your mission officially begins, and No. 21 is no longer alone.
