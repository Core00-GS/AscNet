5	5		301								Roland	It's been a long time since this conference room has seen any use. It's covered in dust. The prop team always fails to clean up the place. Cough.	1																					
6	6		204							1	4																							
7	7		301								Roland	Least I managed to avoid those mechanoids. I need a rest. Phew...	1																					
8	8		301								Roland	It'd be safer to barricade myself in here, but I don't know what's going on. Can't believe my EMP baton broke at a time like this.	1																					
9	9		301								Roland	This is... so strange. Did hackers attack the park? Or is there some new virus that forces machines to attack humans?	1																					
10	10		301								Roland	I don't know enough to even know where to start. I should sever the connection to the park first. If it's a virus or hackers, that should cut their connection.	1																					
11	11		401							2	1515																							
12	12		301								Roland	I need to get in touch with the outside world... A phone... Grr, I can't get through.	1																					
13	13		301								Roland	Can't say I'm surprised. Whether it's hackers or a virus, of course they'd cut off external communication if they can control so many mechanoids.	1																					
14	14		301								Roland	Backup plan. I need a backup plan. Let's see. There should be a bunch of terminals lying around here somewhere...	1																					
15	15		301									The emergency phone in the drawer... Doesn't work. The fire safety line in the basement... Damaged. Walkie-talkies in the cabinet... Scrapped.

17	17		204							1	1

20	20		301								Roland	Current viewers... Great, there are still people online.	1																					
21	21		301								Roland	Need to hurry. First, I'll screen out all unstable signals, then call the last caller... Got one, viewer 6875.	1																					
22	22		301								Roland	Oh, it's that overbearing woman. Whatever. It's an emergency. Now's not the time to care.	1																					
23	23		301									Or is it? Roland hangs his hand on the terminal and hesitates.																						
24	24		301									Directly talking with a viewer like this will ruin the show and expose the truth to the world.																						
25	25		301								Roland	The director's going to yell at me.	1																					
26	26		204							1	1																							
27	27		301								Roland	...Bahahah! Go right ahead. The fee for breaking the contract can't be more than my life.	1																					
28	28		301									Roland smiles bitterly and shakes his head. Still worried about something like that when his own life is in danger... It really is hard to take off the mask after wearing it for so long.

45	45		301								Viewer	Shh, Roland. You don't have to say another word! Call the police, right? Got it!	2																					
46	46		204							1	4																							
47	47		301								Roland	Huh? Miss, you know...	1																					
48	48		301								Viewer	Of course, I do. First, the screen went black. After that, the cameras kept changing, but I saw everything.	2																					
49	49		301								Viewer	You running and looking for a place to hide, then ending up in that conference room. I saw the whole crisis!	2																					
50	50		301								Roland	Oh, haha. Thanks for being such a loyal viewer... Anyway, please call the police ASAP.	1																					
51	51		301								Viewer	Alrighty, you got it!	2																					
52	52		301								Roland	Phew...	1																					
53	53		301									With a sigh of relief, Roland's mind finally has the spare strength to assess the situation with the others.																						
54	54		301								Roland	...The camera was filming me? Was the show recording everything I had just gone through automatically?	1																					
55	55		301								Roland	Oh, that must've been the screenwriter... Thanks. I hope we all get out of here alive.	1																					
56	56		301									(Clenches fist) We will. We just need to call the police. Everyone'll be saved once they get here. They'll put an end to the haywire mechanoids here in the park. After that, Mandy can be fixed up in no time...																						
57	57		301								Viewer	â€”Ok, well have a nice day now! I've got other stuff to do.	2																					
58	58		301								Viewer	I gotta say, this attempt at boosting audience participation is a bit ham-fisted... If I hadn't watched you so much, I would've actually called the police.	2																					
59	59		204							1	7																							
60	60		301								Roland	...Huh?	1																					
61	61		301								Viewer	I knew it right from the start. Adventure shows get old quick. The acting's over the top and the product placement feels forced. And the script? Not good. Plot holes everywhere. A post-apocalyptic spinoff will make for a better sequel.	2																					
62	62		301								Viewer	The crew's ditching the lead actor and they aren't even bothering to hide it, are they? But with you as the lead, I've got my hopes set high. Good luck on the sequel!	2

81	81		301								Roland	Viewer & ^%? Why are there random codes here? Forget it. No point in beating a dead horse.	1																					
82	82		301								Roland	...It connected?!	1																					
83	83		401							2	1515																							
84	84		301									Surprised, Roland turns on the screen and begins to think of what to say. Maybe he was too relaxed when calling for help just now. Maybe he should show some tears. That'll get them to call the police quickly.

229	229		301									As the advertisement draws to an end, a flood of comments suddenly passes by the screen. Right at that moment, Roland sees several familiar IDs.																						
230	230		301									Praise, envy, expectation and worry. The stream of comments, carrying countless emotions, washes toward Roland. Similar content, similar tone, but its point is no longer the illusory Roland.																						
231	231		301									Indeed. Building such a large studio with the intent of keeping a human caged in it for decades without them realizing it is obviously impossible.																						
232	232		301									However, if that person thinks that they are the one deceiving others, it is more likely for them to think that those ubiquitous cameras are not pointed at them, and that the audience is not watching them either. That makes things much easier.																						
233	233		301									Overwork them, distract their mind with complex thoughts, then set up some things disguised as "the outside world" so that they won't have any clue that they are really the star.

236	236		301							1	Roland	W-why...	1																					
237	237		301									A few seconds later, the advertisement ends with cheers from the audience. Regaining control over his limbs, Roland discovers it is his fingers that begin to move first.																						
238	238		204							1	4																							
239	239		301								Roland	No, no, it's okay. Doesn't matter that I've been deceived this whole time. Now, I just need to think about how to survive...	1																					
240	240		301								Roland	Yes, even if it's all fake, it's all of those bastards in the park that did this to me. To hell with them. My parents and Rolmo are still waiting for me outside. As long as I live, I'll be able to see them.	1																					
241	241		301								Roland	Considering the situation now, I won't be able to log into the official account. But the advertisement said that I was the only human in the park, my contract must be somewhere in the database. I should be able to get my family's contact info on it.	1																					
242	242		301								Roland	Contract, contract. If I'm the only human, it should be easy to find... Hack the park's encrypted firewall, and I'll find it in no time... I'm coming, twerp.	1																					
243	243		301								Roland	I've been working hard to maintain this life... I've put in so much blood, sweat, and tears... How can it all be fake...	1																					
244	244		301								Roland	Please... Anyone... Just tell me this is all a part of the rewrite. Tell me that if I leave, it'll all be over...	1

259	259		401							2	561																							
260	260		301			RImgBg1Shake						Suddenly, something crashes into the door behind him, knocking over a pile of heavy objects stacked in the doorway.																						
261	261		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStorySandNew.prefab	2																							
262	262		301									Looking back, a hole is busted into the base of the door. Even though it is too small for someone to fit through, it is still big enough for Roland to see numerous mechanoids shouting as they attempt to squeeze through the door.																						
263	263		301									Even though their faces are destroyed and their eyes shining red, Roland could recognize his colleagues in the surging sea of mechanoids.																						
264	264		301								Roland	Neferti... Omi... The screenwriter...	1																					
265	265		301								Roland	Hahahah! Of course. All of you who kept me company, cared about me, and deceived meâ€”of course, you're all mechanoids. You guys didn't happen to do that twerp's AI, too? Haha!	1																					
266	266		301								Roland	Not only that, but so far, the things I like, the things I hate, the things I stick to, the things I look forward to are all fakes made by you, right? Hahahaha...	1																					
267	267		301									Turning off the terminal, Roland doesn't immediately run away from the door. Rather, he courteously gestures to the door with his arms gently raised and his feet apart like a noble knight greeting guests from afar.																						
268	268		301								Roland	I see. The things in your hands look dangerous. Those aren't props. This time it's for real, isn't it?	1																					
269	269		301								Roland	Alrighty then. Show me what you've got...	1																					
270	270		301								Roland	If nothing is left, no name, no experiences, no pastâ€”everything is fakeâ€”wouldn't it be better just to get this boring life over and done with? Being here with you all now, yes, I wouldn't have it any other way.	1

273	273		201							3	500379		-600																					
274	274		301							1		The hole in the door bursts open. Roland watches as the first mechanoid crawls in through the hole. Perhaps it's a glitch, but he seems to be able to hear them mumbling to themselves.																						
275	275		201							3	500013		-600																					
276	276		301							1	Omi	No, no, no! Roland, you've got the intonation wrong! You need to speak from your gut!		3																				
277	277		301									Omi said this when she was training him to act. She was holding a rolled-up script as she prodded his abdomen and scolded him. Now, that iron bar in her hand would sure pierce right through him.																						
278	278		201							1	500013		600																					
279	279		301							1	Screenwriter	Roland, scene HZZ... Come on, chop, chop!	1																					
280	280		301									Every time the director urged Roland to go to a scene, he would always speak in a hurry. It sounded like two knives stabbing into his ears from his earpiece. Now it liked like he actually wanted to stab him in the ears with those two sharp knives in his hands.																						
281	281		201							2	500013																							
282	282		301							1	Neferti	I hope you... can get some... proper shuteye...	2

286	286		301								Roland	It's almost like you really remember me...	1																					
287	287		301									Neferti is only holding a crude blade. He looks like his muscles are about to tear his clothes to shreds. But based on the damaged frame, he is just a simple, hollow shell.																						
288	288		301									Maybe he only has enough strength to lift that knife. What a joke.																						
289	289		202							1					1																			
290	290		301									Roland thinks a moment, then closes his eyes and takes a step toward his colleaguesâ€”																						
291	291		301			RImgBg1Shake						â€”But he is then pushed aside by a shadowy figure.																						
292	292		201							1	500365	17																						
293	293		301							1	Roland	Rgh...	1																					
294	294		301									Roland crashes into the wall, and his shoulders feel like a chunk is missing from them. But there is no doubt that he is still alive.																						
295	295		204							1	7																							
296	296		301								Roland	...Mandy?	1																					
297	297		301									Looking back, the mechanoid officer stands in his place. His side appears to be pierced by a sharp weapon, exposing his familiar mechanical insides.																						
298	298		204							1	1																							
299	299		301								Roland	Haha. Mandy, it's not like you to join the battlefield. But now that you're here, don't hold back...	1																					
300	300		201							1	500378																							
301	301		301							1	Mandhasti	When a knight. In trouble. Is the King's duty. To help.	1

312	312		301							1	Roland	Hmph.	1																					
313	313		301									One step back, two steps back. Roland suddenly turns around and bumps into the shelf beside him. A shelf full of prop goods falls over, blocking the small hole.																						
314	314		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					He doesn't bother to check on the mechanoids behind him. Instead, he turns to run out of the other exit.

318	318		301									Where is he going? He doesn't know where in the park is still safe, nor if he could still survive this.																						
319	319		301									There is no direction, no goal, just running like a bat out of hell. Every step he takes, he wants to take back. Every time he accelerates, he feels something slow him down.																						
320	320		301									Roland does not even feel that he is running. He feels like he is just tormenting himself with the ultimate goal of exhausting every ounce remaining of his strength.																						
321	321		301									His legs gradually fill with the burn of lactic acid. Yet the pain clears up his sense of logic and reason.																						
322	322		301									The brief scene and fragmented sentences gradually come together to make sense in his head.

336	336		301								Roland	AI-simulated personality, holograms, voice changers... Imitating family members when speaking with them and playing recordings when necessary... It's too easy to fabricate the illusion of family. Real family members can also enjoy a life of leisure and watch all this on TV from a distance.	1																					
337	337		301								Roland	I wonder if they got a good price out of me. Are their lives any better because of it?	1																					
338	338		301								Roland	What do they think when they watch my performance?	1																					
339	339		301								Roland	Hah... I'm sure they'd get a kick out of it.	1																					
340	340		301								Roland	A knight? An actor? Or that so-called process of pursuing whatever that gives me a sense of really being alive?	1																					
341	341		301								Roland	In the end, everything I pursued was a lie. Just a clown in makeup mocked and laughed at by others.	1																					
342	342		301								Roland	Good show... Jolly good show...	1																					
343	343		301								Roland	How can you not laugh at such a wonderful performance?	1

349	349		301									Breathing can no longer support the strenuous exercise. Each breath is like swallowing an inflated balloon. Every time he steps, the lactic acid makes his muscles feel like they're being pulled apart.
