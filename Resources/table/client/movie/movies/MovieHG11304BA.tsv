4	4		401							2	1516																							
5	5		301									You were just leaving the building after being done with work, when a sudden wave of dizziness strikes you—something forceful is clamping on your nape and dragging you toward the glow of a street lamp.																						
6	6		201							1	500168																							
7	7		301							1	Vera	You just never learn, don't you?	1																					
8	8		302								Vera?!	9																						
9	9		301									Vera has her knife poised before your neck. You feel the cold steel almost licking your throat, as well as the steadfastness of her grip through her supple fingers.																						
10	10		204							1	13																							
11	11		301								Vera	Need a lesson. Hm?	1																					
12	12		301									With that, Vera presses her knife closer and closer to your neck. Your breath pauses. Her eyes glow—red, sinister, obsessive. Staring, lips unfurling, crazed...																						
13	13		302								W-wait!	14	(Retaliate)	17																				
14	14		301								Vera	Begging for forgiveness? Now?	1																					
15	15		301								Vera	Hah, but the more you beg... the more it gets me going!	1																					
16	16		302								(Life-or-death!)	17																						
17	17		301									You raise your arm and lash out at her elbow to throw off her balance. She circles around you to regain posture, during which you hop back, gaining distance.																						
18	18		302								What is wrong with you?	19																						
19	19		204							1																								
20	20		301								Vera	Still playing dumb? Then I'll just cut to the chase.	1																					
21	21		301								Vera	You've been looking into me, haven't you?	1																					
22	22		302								...	23	(Deny)	24																				
23	23	25	301								Vera	I'll take that as a yes.	1																					
24	24		301								Vera	You know I despise liars.	1																					
25	25		301									Vera rushes you with her knife raised. You dodge by the skin of your teeth.																						
26	26		302								I know what you've been doing.	27																						
27	27		204							1	13																							
28	28		301								Vera	Pushing it, aren't you? Get ready for a lesson.	1																					
29	29		302								Sensory boosters, right?	30																						
30	30		204							1																								
31	31		301								Vera	...	1																					
32	500		401							1	211																							
33	32		301									On hearing that, Vera darkens up and her attacks grow more and more murderous.																						
34	33		301								Vera	And? Policing me, now, are you?	1																					
35	34		302								Are you using them?	35																						
36	35		204							1	13																							
37	36		301								Vera	Pah... You think I need that batter to feel pain?	1																					
38	38		302								Then why...	39																						
39	39		301								Vera	You know NOTHING about how hellish it gets on the battlefield.	1																					
40	40		302								I know.	41																						
41	41		301								Vera	Yeah? You ever had your squad mates dismembered, torn apart before your eyes? You ever had your people devoured by the Corrupted?	1																					
42	42		301								Vera	You ever felt despair? You ever tried to stop something—even throwing your life at it—and not make a dent in the slightest?	1																					
43	43		301								Vera	You ever died, only to live again?!	1																					
44	44		301									Vera's continual assault slowly edges you toward a wall. You find yourself overwhelmed and cornered.																						
45	45		204							1																								
46	46		301								Vera	Soldiers turn themselves into "machines," forfeiting their souls in battle. Ravenling, you have the best of the best under you. You know nothing of war. To win against the virus, your happy-go-lucky few won't cut it.	1																					
47	47		301								Vera	In war. You either grit your teeth and take it. Or you die.	1																					
48	48		301								Vera	I'm only choosing the lesser evil.	1																					
49	49		302								But you can always recall your consciousness.	50																						
50	50		301								Vera	...Aha. Ahahaha...	1																					
51	51		301								Vera	My, oh, my. Mon cher Commandant. Are you naive or are you just dumb?	1																					
52	52		302								...?	53																						
53	53		301								Vera	I'll put it this way then. Even as a Construct, doing so is no different from admitting defeat.	1																					
54	54		301								Vera	On the battlefield, pain is life.	1																					
55	55		302								But you shouldn't use drugs.	56	You don't trust your teammates.	58																				
56	56		204							1	13																							
57	57	501	301								Vera	Hah. You're the last person I need telling me what I should or shouldn't do——	1																					
58	58		204							1	13																							
59	59		301								Vera	Who cares if they live or die! As long as they don't stand in the way of my mission——	1																					
60	501		401							1	210																							
61	60		301									You perform the same move from before. She responds this time by twisting the cut downward, sidestepping to maintain distance. You catch her wrist with your left hand, then chop at her knife with your right.																						
62	61		301									Clink, clang——																						
63	62		301									Her knife falls to the ground with a melodious trickle.																						
64	63		301									You entangle her remaining hand with your right, now keeping both her hands locked. Vera slightly raises her brows. She did not expect it to turn this way.																						
65	64		204							1	1																							
66	65		301								Vera	"Commandant"... How long do you want to keep me pinned like this?	1																					
67	66		302								(Let her go)	67	Sorry.	67																				
68	67		301									Now free, Vera strokes her neck meaningfully.																						
69	68		302								...?	69																						
70	69		301									You touch your throat as well and find it wet. Raising your hand before your eyes, you realize that it is blood. Somehow, you feel no pain from the wound, only a slight tingling sensation.																						
71	70		302								Anesthetics?	71																						
72	71		301									If she truly wanted you dead, you would not have lasted more than a few seconds.																						
73	72		301								Vera	Guess it's impossible to get it through your thick skull... Hmph, consider our warm-up just now a little "hello," commandant of Gray Raven.	1																					
74	73		301									Vera spits the words out clearly. Her voice echoes like whip-cracks, demanding and intimidating.																						
75	74		204							1	13																							
76	75		301								Vera	Stay out of my life.	1																					
77	76		302								I can help.	77																						
78	77		204							1	1																							
79	78		301								Vera	...Sure. Then why don't you wrap yourself up in a nice little gift box and send your rump over to my room?	1																					
80	79		302								Not like that!	80																						
81	80		204							1	13																							
82	81		301								Vera	Then get lost. Birdbrain.	1																					
83	82		301								Vera	...Oh. You aren't doing this so you can squirm out of this whole ordeal, are you?	1																					
84	83		301								Vera	Then let me save you the trouble. That thing about using your name? That was just me messing with you.	1																					
85	84		302								Wha...	85	Finally out with it now, huh?	85																				
86	85		204							1	1																							
87	86		301								Vera	You didn't think I was serious, did you?	1																					
88	87		301								Vera	How adorable.	1																					
89	88		301									Your honest reaction to being messed with seems to have pleased Vera. She pats you on the head roughly.																						
90	89		302								...	90																						
91	90		301								Vera	Alright alright, I'll let you go.	1																					
92	91		301								Vera	Your name's clean. So shoo—fly, little bird. Never let anyone stop you.	1																					
93	92		301								Vera	And. Another tip. Stalk me again. And you'll get the full Vera treatment.	1																					
94	93		302								Is this a threat?	94																						
95	94		301								Vera	Damn right it is.	1																					
96	95		301									Vera eyes you thoughtfully all of a sudden, then squints. Something seems to have come over her.																						
97	96		301								Vera	Wait. Change of plans.	1																					
98	97		301								Vera	Meet me tomorrow. The current time. C-Labs. F23-C04.	1																					
99	98		302								C-Labs?	99																						
100	99		301									The C lab blocks are all deserted, and a key card is required for entry. Why would Vera want you to meet her there...?																						
101	100		301								Vera	Come and you'll know.	1																					
102	101		202							1																								
103	102		401							2	1516																							
104	103		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Leaving you with this enigmatic farewell, Vera walks away.
