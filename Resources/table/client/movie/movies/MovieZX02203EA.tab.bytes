4	4		301									Defensive artillery runs silently at the city outskirt. Building repairs inside the conversation area are not over; people set up tents at the foot of the CPF, resting and dining by the sporadic campfire and the moonlight.																						
5	5		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You can hear the conversation of two soldiers from a nearby tent. They have kept their voices low to avoid disturbing others' rest, but you still manage to hear them, having sat close by.

9	9		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Construct Soldier	Why aren't you sleeping?	1																					
10	10		301								Armed Scavenger	...Can't sleep.	2																					
11	11		301								Construct Soldier	Something on your mind?	1																					
12	12		301								Armed Scavenger	...	2																					
13	13		301									The Scavenger soldier sighs heavily after a long silence.																						
14	14		301								Armed Scavenger	Sigh... It just feels unreal.	2																					
15	15		301								Armed Scavenger	Before you lot saved me and took me here, my friend and I were just wandering about.	2																					
16	16		301								Armed Scavenger	There was no tent, not to mention a bed, just in case some Corrupted showed up during our sleep and took us out. We had to rest back-to-back, guns in our hands, hidden in a hole somewhere.	2																					
17	17		301								Armed Scavenger	Now there's a tent, and food, and Babylonia to keep us safe. We ain't relying on our junk equipment to protect ourselves no more.	2																					
18	18		301								Armed Scavenger	There's still a gun in my hand, but my friend couldn't last long enough to get help from Babylonia.	2																					
19	19		301								Construct Soldier	I'm sorry.	1																					
20	20		301								Armed Scavenger	There's nothing to apologize for. Ol' Johnny and I both knew we'd die any moment. No despairin' without dreamin', that's how we Scavengers see it.	2																					
21	21		301								Armed Scavenger	But seeing the conservation area being rebuilt, hearing the news of other cities getting taken back, and receiving supplies from Babylonia‚Äîthat's when I knew that the days of living in fear were over.	2																					
22	22		301								Armed Scavenger	Safety and stability are back, and it all just feels so unreal.	2																					
23	23		301								Construct Soldier	I understand.	1																					
24	24		301								Construct Soldier	I used to be a soldier fighting on the frontline as well. Barely got rescued from underneath the grim reaper's scythe, and now I'm stationed way back here in the conservation area.	1																					
25	25		301								Construct Soldier	The cries of my company when they died still echo in my ears. I can still feel their broken limbs on my fingertips.	1																					
26	26		301								Construct Soldier	Enemies with overwhelming power easily took down my squad. Despair had shattered my will to fight.	1																					
27	27		301								Construct Soldier	The last thing I saw before I blacked out was a raven-winged Ascendant.	1																					
28	28		301								Armed Scavenger	But you still survived.	2																					
29	29		301								Construct Soldier	Yeah. I found out afterward that a squad managed to defeat the Ascendant and held the defense line.	1																					
30	30		301								Armed Scavenger	Who were they?	2																					
31	31		301								Construct Soldier	Gray Raven. That's what the report said.	1																					
32	32		302								...	33																						
33	33		301								Armed Scavenger	Aren't they the ones here earlier today...	2																					
34	34		301								Construct Soldier	That's right. They're still fighting on multiple battlefields, even to this day.	1																					
35	35		301								Construct Soldier	It's because of soldiers like them that I don't think humans are hopeless in this war.	1																					
36	36		301								Armed Scavenger	I see... We were both crushed by despair, which is why the safety we're feeling now is so unreal, I guess.	2																					
37	37		301								Construct Soldier	Enough with the cheesy stuff. We're alive, after all.	1																					
38	38		301								Construct Soldier	As long as we live, we have to carry on our companions' hopes and dreams and bring them to fruition.	1																					
39	39		301								Armed Scavenger	...You're right.	2																					
40	40		301								Construct Soldier	Don't you have some cards with you? If you can't sleep, how about a game?	1																					
41	41		301								Armed Scavenger	Sigh... Sure.	2																					
42	42		301								Construct Soldier	...	1																					
43	43		301								Armed Scavenger	...	2																					
44	44		301								Armed Scavenger	Dammit... I can't even hold my cards steady now...	2																					
45	45		301									The old, raspy voice of the Scavenger sounds shaken.																						
46	46		202							2																								
47	47		301								Armed Scavenger	I'm going to bed... We'll play next time.	2																					
48	48		202							1																								
49	49		301									Having said that, the Scavenger does not seem to have fallen asleep, given the rustling sound you hear from the tent.																						
50	50		301								Construct Soldier	Right, next time. Both of us.																						
51	51		301									You hear quiet sobbing from the tent, and his weeping adorns the silent night.																						
52	52		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You stand up and walk far away.																						
53	53		401							1	208																							
54	54		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory11.jpg																								
55	55		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You hear a lullaby, on and off, on your way. Following the sound, you see Liv sitting in a crowd next to a woman, humming along with her. The woman is teaching her how to sing the song.																						
56	56		301									Between the two lies a familiar, kitten-like boy. The corner of his mouth is still dotted with crumbs of rations; Liv has covered him with a blanket, in case he catches a cold during the night.																						
57	57		301									The woman teaches Liv as she watches carefully at the sleeping boy, gently rubbing away the crumbs by his mouth.																						
58	58		302								Liv, what's the situation...	59																						
59	59		301									Liv gestures to you to be quiet. It seems that the boy has just fallen asleep.																						
60	60		301									The woman carries a cup to you.																						
61	61		201							1	500251																							
62	62		301							1	Woman	This is some soup that we made. I hope you won't mind.	1																					
63	63		301									You find yellow-tinted broth inside. Behind them is a pot with barely enough soup cooked, but she still fills your cup to the brim. The sweetness of corn perfumes the air.																						
64	64		302								Did you plant this?	65																						
65	65		301								Woman	Yes. We planted them on the experimental farm inside the conservation area.	1																					
66	66		301								Woman	Akdilek brought us excellent seeds for corn from other conservation areas, turning the impossible dream of growing crops possible.	1																					
67	67		301									You take the cup from the woman and take a sip.																						
68	68		301									The initial bitterness turns to sweetness as the corn mixture passes your throat, its fragrance filling your mouth. As the woman has said, this is something impossible to dream of in the past, with the harsh environment on the surface.																						
69	69		301								Woman	There's something I want to say to you ever since leaving the no man's land.	1																					
70	70		302								?	71	Please.	71																				
71	71		301									Looking at Liv and you, the woman is getting emotional. Her lips are trembling before eventually saying two words.																						
72	72		301								Woman	Thank you.	1																					
73	73		301								Woman	You didn't mind how hostile we were when we first met, saving my grandson nonetheless and bringing us here to this conservation area.	1																					
74	74		301								Woman	Even though we agreed with relocating here, we still didn't approve of everything Babylonia did when we first arrived.	1																					
75	75		301								Woman	But after living here, we start to realize something we didn't want to accept‚Äîthat even though the World Government has abandoned us once, it doesn't mean that everyone there has given up those of us remaining on the surface.	1																					
76	76		301								Woman	The conservation areas built one after another are the best evidence.	1																					
77	77		301								Woman	Old habits die hard, but we Scavengers have left the no man's land behind. Perhaps it's time we start anew.	1																					
78	78		301									After thanking you, the woman's words come out nonstop like a broken dam.																						
79	79		301								Woman	My apologies. Someone my age should be able to remain calm despite the changes, but it turns out I'm still as sentimental as ever.	1																					
80	80		202							1																								
81	81		301									She wipes away the tears from the corner of her eyes, returning to her grandson's side, sitting down and caressing his cheek.																						
82	82		301									Still, the gentle smile hung at the corner of her mouth cannot hide the sorrow underneath.																						
83	83		301									They finally have food on their plates and a roof above their heads, but the only family they have left is each other.																						
84	84		301									All her other relatives, much like the many families on the surface, have been lost during the war with the Punishing Virus.																						
85	85		301									Liv reaches out and gently pats the woman on the back.																						
86	86		301									The woman is no longer the defensive mother she once was, leaning her head on Liv's shoulders and drifting off to sleep.																						
87	87		301									Seeing the woman and child by her side, Liv looks at you and nods, indicating that you can leave this area to her.																						
88	88		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The temperature begins to decrease as the night continues. People gather in their tents in groups, soundly asleep, accompanied by the moonlight and the lullaby.

103	103		301									Conservation areas are being built one after another behind the frontlines. With the help of Akdilek, people are trading with each other. ARU is being steadily rebuilt. Lost bases in some areas are recovered by the Forsaken.																						
104	104		301									With each of your recent missions, you can see the surface is on track to being reclaimed.																						
105	105		301									You have also fulfilled your objectives perfectly, encouraging the men and women on the ground as the Parliament hopes.

164	164		301									Why would they withhold the coordinates of Luna's home from Cerberus in the first place? Why did they give them the wrong coordinates and task you to locate them?																						
165	165		301									That arrangement was not a mistake. It was a deliberate test.																						
166	166		301									And ignoring the underlying threat Kurono is presenting, hidden beneath the calm surface of Babylonia‚Äî
