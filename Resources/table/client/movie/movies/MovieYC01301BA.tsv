4	4		301			DialogEnable						The sound of anxious back-and-forth pacing fills the research room, deep in the facility.																						
5	5		201							1	500184																							
6	6		301							1	Shome	It's been too long...	1																					
7	7		202							1																								
8	8		301									It is a dimly-lit room, the interior flickering under the weak jaundice of the lighting. To the Ascendant Shome, however, brightness has long since lost its meaning.																						
9	9		301									In the middle of the research room lies writhing mechanical remains—some are missing limbs, some have their torsos replaced by monstrous-looking ones, some are left with only their heads.																						
10	10		301									Oil, vital fluid, indistinguishable liquids seep from under their bodies.																						
11	11		301									The network of attached pipes are endlessly pumping activators inside, forcing these remains awake.																						
12	12		301									...Forcing them alive, pumping them with life, making them writhe in sickening madness.																						
13	13		401							2	1508																							
14	14		301									They squirm and shift, struggling to drag themselves toward Shome. However, the cables and tubes attached to their bodies stop them from ever reaching him.																						
15	15		301			RImgBg1Shake						Unending hisses and wrathful thrashes of the Corrupted erupt from the back of the research room. The electricity traps on the wall flicker and burn their bodies.																						
16	16		401							2	1506																							
17	17		301									Their limbs burn, disintegrate, but regenerate, bit by bit. They repeat this cycle over and over, all to break through this wall and reach the research room.																						
18	18		301									Why? Because Shome is in the center of the research room, and his hand holds a shot of the Punishing Virus, flashing with scarlet electricity.																						
19	19		301									This place should be a familiar sight, but Shome's heart twinges with unease.																						
20	20		201							1	500184																							
21	21		301							1	Shome	Seventy-two hours have passed. He would never make such a mistake.	1																					
22	22		301								Shome	...	1																					
23	23		301								Shome	For safety's sake.	1																					
24	24		202							1																								
25	25		401							2	1515																							
26	26		301									Shome turns to the console behind him and taps quickly on the screen.																						
27	27		201							1	500184																							
28	28		301							1	Shome	Experiment Record No. 70412:	1																					
29	29		301								Shome	Experimental Ascension Bodies Batch 70411, failed. The initial Ascnet filtering is too much for the current equipment and degree of modification. The impact still cannot be alleviated externally.	1																					
30	30		301									Shome sets the injection aside. He clears his throat before he continues.																						
31	31		301								Shome	Hmph, as expected.	1																					
32	32		301								Shome	Based on the initial reactions of the subjects, I'm walking on the right path.	1																					
33	33		301								Shome	Given the right environment and some fine-tuning to the mod-data for the corrupted host, I will definitely succeed.	1																					
34	34		301								Shome	Alright, this should do it for the final recording. Begin data export.	1																					
35	35		301								System	Export command received. ID verification: Dr. Shome. Authority level: EX+. Beginning export procedure.																						
36	36		202							1																								
37	37		401							2	1516																							
38	38		301									The console hums as it runs. Shome walks past the carnage in the room.																						
39	39		201							1	500184																							
40	40		301							1	Shome	Experimental Subject No. 65018 lasted a long time in the first filtering. He gave me good refitting materials.	1																					
41	41		301								Shome	Experimental Subject No. 63901. This humanoid was made from the Constructs of the same squad. They were all good raw materials but it's a pity they still couldn't survive the first filtering after fusing them.	1																					
42	42		202							1																								
43	43		301									The scenes flash through Shome's mind. Every single experimental subject, taken apart, studied, forced to connect to the Ascension-Network. To Shome, all of the subjects are like his medals of honor.																						
44	44		401							2	1509																							
45	45		301								System	Data export complete.																						
46	46		301									Hearing the system beep, Shome returns to the console. He stows the ejected black cube on himself.																						
47	47		301									Mechanical noises ring out from where he stowed the cube. When the noise finally dies down, Shome straightens his clothes and moves, checking to see that the cube is not affecting his movement.																						
48	48		201							1	500184																							
49	49		301							1	Shome	Even the most wonderful of times must come to an end. It's time to say goodbye to this place.	1																					
50	50		401							2	1515																							
51	51		202							1																								
52	52		301									At that, Shome enters the terminal command on the console. Several mechanical arms appear on the walls as the command is executed. The arms dance about the room, dismantling all the machinery one by one.																						
53	53		301									Soon, the barely alive mechanical remains become piles of metal scrap.																						
54	54		301								System	Bzz—																						
55	55		401							2	1506																							
56	56		301									After a burst of buzzes, the console and all its mechanical arms fall silent.																						
57	57		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Seeing the research room taken by silence, Shome pushes his glasses lightly and leaves.																						
58	58		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory29.jpg																								
59	59		401							1	201																							
60	60		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Shome walks alone on the main path of the research facility. Suddenly, he stops at a T-section.																						
61	61		301								???	Long time no see, Shome.																						
62	62		201							1	500184																							
63	63		301							1	Shome	Hah. You actually came over. Didn't you use to look down on my research?	1																					
64	64		301								???	Heh. You're the same as ever.																						
65	65		203							1	0.25	-400																						
66	66		201							2	500008		400																					
67	67		301							1		The speaker steps out casually from the back right corner. He rests his chain blade to one side, then lazily leans against the wall.																						
68	68		301								Shome	You seem different from before.	1																					
69	69		301								Roland	I did go through a lot in that city after all.	2																					
70	70		301								Shome	You did, didn't you? Judging from the data reports from Kowloong, there were quite a few accidents. But, overall, we can consider it a victory.	1																					
71	71		301								Roland	"We?" Hah. All your time was spent holing up in labs around the world, messing around with your pointless research.	2																					
72	72		301								Roland	"We," hah. Almost forgot you're an "Ascendant."	2																					
73	76		301								Shome	You're mostly right, but I must get one thing clear.	1																					
74	77		301								Shome	I am not chosen by Miss Luna, but you and I both serve the Ascension-Network. Technically speaking, we are both Ascendants.	1																					
75	78		301								Roland	Ahaha. You're becoming just like Gabriel in your pedantry.	2																					
76	79		301									Shome is about to protest, but resigns when he notices Roland rambling without a care for him.																						
77	80		301									So Shome merely shakes his head and begins to walk again.																						
78	81		301								Shome	I'll listen to your rambles after I come back. I have a new research task on hand.	1																					
79	82		301									Roland pauses and looks at Shome.																						
80	83		301								Roland	I take it that you aren't coming with us on the next mission, then?	2																					
81	84		301								Shome	Naturally. My research is what made me live through the filtering, is it not?	1																					
82	85		301								Roland	Ahaha... Is that so?	2																					
83	86		301								Shome	Hmph. Which reminds me, how's that device you asked me for working out? You didn't seem to have used it in front of the others. Remember to send me the data after you use it.	1																					
84	87		301								Shome	After all, I'm just a researcher with zero combative capabilities. All this killing and fighting—I'll leave it to you professionals.	1																					
85	88		401							2	1516																							
86	89		203							1	0.25	-600																						
87	90		301									Shome strolls past Roland, walking toward the left of the intersection.																						
88	91		301								Roland	Hah. A researcher with zero combative capabilities, you say. Never knew these researchers could leisurely fix all the hidden turrets on someone pointing a piece at 'em.	2																					
89	92		301								Shome	If you really wanted me dead, I'd be long dead before all this turret business.	1																					
90	93		301								Roland	...Oh, what a spoilsport you are.	2																					
91	94		301								Shome	Born this way.	1																					
92	95		401							2	1516																							
93	96		203							1	1	-1460																						
94	97		301									Shome pushes his glasses up again. With no intention to fool around with Roland, he leaves through the passage.																						
95	98		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Roland puts away his scythe gun after he speaks, and walks in the completely opposite direction of Shome, to the other end of the corridor.

100	103		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Gabriel	Looks like the rat came out of its hole.																						
101	104		301								Roland	Indeed. But why all this hassle anyway? It'd be easier for me to just off him right now.	1																					
102	105		301								Gabriel	Then we cannot weed out all of his labs.																						
103	106		301								Roland	Fine, fine, I got it.	1																					
104	107		203							1	0.25	-400																						
105	108		201							2	500101		400																					
106	109		301							1		Roland displays his impatience in full, waving his hand to cut Gabriel off. From outside of the facility, Gabriel puts away the book he was reading and steps into the light.																						
107	110		204							1	4																							
108	111		301								Roland	You know, if you weren't sitting here, I might have already popped a cap in him.	1																					
109	112		301								Gabriel	You cannot bear the consequences of doing so.	2																					
110	113		301								Roland	Pah... Enough of that. What about the others?	1																					
111	114		301								Gabriel	Alpha has set off. I'm ready too.	2																					
112	115		301								Roland	Hah, well, well. Guess it's finally time.	1																					
113	116		301									Roland stretches as he walks past Gabriel. Gabriel turns to face the research facility, removing his hat in a salute. He returns the hat and catches up to Roland.

116	118		301									A loud explosion booms from behind, and the research facility collapses in the blast. The heatwave sends the coats of the two fluttering wildly.

118	120		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	Now then, let the game begin.	1
