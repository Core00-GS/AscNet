3	3		301			DialogEnable						As far as the conception of consciousness goes, humankind and the machines are different in one regard—that is, humankind is unable to recall when exactly they first became conscious in life.																						
4	4		301									Was it during infancy, when they first developed memories and emotions? Or from the very first cry after they left their mother? Or could it be traced all the way back to when the zygote was formed in the oviduct, and was about to rapidly self-divide?																						
5	5		301									This topic is rather philosophical than biological. But the same question is very easy to answer for mechanoids.																						
6	6		301									When you connect a mechanoid to power and turn on its program, a brand-new, mature, and highly-intelligent consciousness is born.																						
7	7		301									Mechanoids can find any moment that is stored in their memory at any time.																						
8	8		301									A prediction by humankind produces contradiction—because, try as they may, humankind will run into unpredictable causality and time.																						
9	9		301									But in a computed prediction by mechanical programs, every action is but an execution of the known future.																						
10	10		301									Running at full power, Gestalt is able to deduce several different routes of the world's possible endings. Nanami will store them all in her memories.																						
11	11		301									Gestalt's simulation of the future has no influence on what's going on in the real world. Each time Nanami makes a decision on a time node, a possible future outcome is selected. When she moves forward, infinite possibilities are created once again.																						
12	12		301									She is unaware of how many possible scenarios stand between her and the future at the end of the chosen time-space. Nor does she know whether all the routes selected will lead to the same future.

52	52		301								Gestalt	...According to my search results, it's a sci-fi movie humankind created in the Golden Age.																						
53	53		301							1	Nanami	I have... seen a lot of interesting work like that. humankind loves giant robots with a capital L.	1																					
54	54		301								Nanami	In their culture, such robots are often related to the power of god... As long as humans are piloting them, they have the courage to battle storms.	1																					
55	55		301								Nanami	I think I now understand... why I have Power in the future. I really like it.	1																					
56	56		301								Nanami	Which is why I made it... I mean, if I didn't make it, then I don't see why I always have Power with me in the future. Interesting, no?	1																					
57	57		301								Gestalt	Are you implying that robots are a symbol of man-made power to fight against destiny?																						
58	58		301								Gestalt	But my scanning results only show that the mechanoid named Nanami was experiencing a computing power overload. I believe this robot is but evidence that you had to change to a different frame and rely on external tools to continue the simulation.																						
59	59		301								Nanami	Haha. That's so not romantic...	1
