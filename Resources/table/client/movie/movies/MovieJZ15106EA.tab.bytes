8	8		301			RImgBg1Shake						The Corrupted thrusts his greatsword forward, in a move just like the past... and the Construct blocks it just as easily.

13	13		301							1	Mao Zhen	You're just a kid I found on the street. Thought you had something in you, so I taught you a thing or two.	2																					
14	14		301								Mao Zhen	You don't really expect me to take care of you to the end, huh? Besides, you wouldn't even have survived without me.	2																					
15	15		301								Camu	What's the point of surviving as a lab rat? And stabbed in the back by our own... Are you kidding me? Shouldn't our enemy be the Corrupted?	1																					
16	16		301								Mao Zhen	You ARE the Corrupted, Camu.	2																					
17	17		301								Camu	We're humans!	1																					
18	18		401							2	1512																							
19	19		301									Since halfway through the duel, Camu has abandoned his weapon and started fighting with his legs and fists. He attempts to move closer, but Mao Zhen continues to back away, blocking Camu's every move with his greatsword.																						
20	20		301								Mao Zhen	The Punishing Virus in your body is way over the limit. And you're wreaking havoc, letting your instincts take over. What difference do you have from the Corrupted now?	2																					
21	21		301								Mao Zhen	You were once a human... but it's a matter of time before your corporeal body is destroyed by the virus.	2																					
22	22		301								Camu	How dare you!	1																					
23	23		301								Mao Zhen	In the beginning, you did have a chance to be promoted to real Kurono soldiers... Too bad the experiment failed.	2																					
24	24		301								Mao Zhen	Or I should say that it was doomed to fail in the beginning. Injecting humans with the Punishing Virus? This sort of madness would never bear fruit.	2																					
25	25		301								Mao Zhen	When abnormalities started occurring in your squad, the officials understood that Constructs were the way to go.	2																					
26	26		301								Camu	So you're the result of a successful experiment, huh?! Mao Zhen?!	1																					
27	27		301								Mao Zhen	I was a test subject all the same. Only 50 members of the Special Security Department survived.	2																					
28	28		301								Camu	In that case, why would you still work for Kurono?	1																					
29	29		301								Mao Zhen	No matter what's involved in the process, as long as we can defeat the virus and protect the world... then the sacrifices are worth it.	2																					
30	30		301								Camu	That's not what I think!	1																					
31	31		301								Mao Zhen	But that's what the whole world thinks! It's the only thing that keeps it going, Camu!	2																					
32	32		301								Camu	All I know is that we were lied to. The virus is not what wants to kill us... you are!	1

35	35		301									By then Mao Zhen has stopped backing away and starts stepping forward to meet Camu's attacks.																						
36	36		301									Camu recognizes exactly what he is doing and leaps onto Mao Zhen's greatsword, using it as a stepping stone to reach a higher spot.																						
37	37		201							1	500188																							
38	38		301							1	Mao Zhen	Hmph. Take that, kid!	1																					
39	39		202							1																								
40	40		301									Instead of losing balance from Camu's action, Mao Zhen stabilizes himself with his Construct capabilities and raises his greatsword, swinging it at Camu.																						
41	41		201							1	500189																							
42	42		301							1	Camu	Now!	1

48	48		301									This was never a one-on-one duel to begin with.																						
49	49		301									Camu had long expected that Mao Zhen would be waiting for him and that they would duel.																						
50	50		301									So his squadmates had been waiting for their chance out of sight. Right on cue, a bullet penetrates Mao Zhen's palm, sending his greatsword flying.																						
51	51		301									Camu takes the greatsword a second before Mao Zhen can.																						
52	52		201							1	500189	5																						
53	53		301							1	Camu	No need to blame it on the virus or call yourself a savior of humans. Even without the pandemic, I know you people would still do what you did for your own benefit!	1																					
54	54		301				DialogDisable				Camu	Someone who abandons others easily are not qualified to talk about saving the world!	1

60	60		301			DialogEnable						He lands, turns around, and charges towards Mao Zhen, roaring. The greatsword pierces through the Construct's body.																						
61	61		301									For a second, time seems to have frozen.																						
62	62		301								Camu	Besides... I despise this world, Master.																						
63	63		301									Mao Zhen does not reply. He gazes at Camu's face, at his gradually bruising arm, then at the greatsword, drenched with his own vital fluid.																						
64	64		301									And then down at his own body, where sparks from the snapped wires are dancing. He looks nothing like a human.																						
65	65		301								Mao Zhen	Honestly... same.																						
66	66		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Camu	Master...?

70	70		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						As Mao Zhen collapses, the fire from downstairs has spread to where they are. Camu finally hears the screams of horror and despair coming from inside the building.																						
71	71		301									There are tears in everyone's eyes, be it Camu's comrades or the guards on Mao Zhen's side.																						
72	72		301									And then Camu hears a familiar noise.																						
73	73		301									A loud whirring sounds from above his head. Something crashes through the wall and drops‚Äî																						
74	74		301									And explodes.																						
75	75		401			RImgBg1Shake				2	10007502																							
76	76		201							1	500189	5																						
77	77		301							1	Camu	Kurono!!!	1																					
78	78		301									Through the opening in the wall, Camu sees the aircraft that had killed his comrades. They have found his squad...																						
79	79		301									...And have come after them.																						
80	80		301									Without a way to escape this burning building, Camu can only watch as the explosions swallow his comrades and the guards.																						
81	81		301									There is nothing he can do. He has no strength left anyway after dueling Mao Zhen. Not that he would want to live after that.																						
82	82		301									As the building falls, Camu lets the weapon slip out of his hand. He gazes up at the pale, pale sky.																						
83	83		301								Camu	Dammit...	1																					
84	84		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Camu	Damn it all!	1
