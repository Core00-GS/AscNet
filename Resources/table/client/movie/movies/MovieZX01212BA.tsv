5	5		301									On your way back to the city, you run into the traveling Support Force agents. You follow their instructions and put Lucia in the transport truck.

10	12		301								Bridget	She's in pretty bad shape. What on earth happened...?	1																					
11	13		302								The Ascendants happened.	14	Is she gonna be okay?	17																				
12	14		301								Bridget	The Ascendants...? Then you guys must be Gray Raven. It's incredible you made it here alive. Elite squad indeed.	1																					
13	15		301								Liv	But we didn't even get anything done. Worse, we...	2																					
14	16	18	301								Bridget	Just the fact that you're all alive is something.	1																					
15	17		301								Bridget	Yes, as long as we can keep her M.I.N.D. alive. But she's not returning to the battlefield any time soon.	1																					
16	18		301								Bridget	Anyway, first things first, we gotta bring her back to our base. You guys go ahead and return to battle.	1																					
17	19		301									With that, Bridget motions the driver to start the truck and hops on the back.

23	25		301							1	Ayla	Then from here on out, let me assist Gray Raven!	2																					
24	26		301									A cheerful voice from a scythe-wielding Construct dispels the gloom—Ayla. Like always, she is in that painterly frame of hers, looking out of place in a battlefield.																						
25	27		302								What are you doing here, Ayla?	28	Assist...?	29																				
26	28	30	301								Ayla	President Hassen issued a call to arms. I'm not a combatant, but I know I gotta be a part of this!	2																					
27	29		301								Ayla	I rushed over as soon as I learned what happened to Lucia. So let me help out, Commandant!	2																					
28	30		301								Ayla	And besides...	2																					
29	31		301									Ayla pauses and fishes through her decorative backpack, then displays a strangely shaped device.

34	36		301							1	Hassen	Good, now we can talk. Gray Raven, how am I sounding?	2																					
35	37		302								Mr. President?	38	Why this device?	40																				
36	38		301								Hassen	...You must be wondering why I'm speaking to you via Ayla's connection device.	2																					
37	39	41	301								Lee	Must be the scrambler waves from Kowloong. Not sure if it's effective against the Ascendants, but it sure messed up our comms systems.	1																					
38	40		301								Hassen	Kowloong is broadcasting a scrambling signal. This is the only way I can contact you from outside the city.	2																					
39	41		301								Hassen	We're already at work fixing the connection, but I'm afraid it's gonna take a while, so I had this comms device sent to you.	2																					
40	42		301								Lee	You have new orders for us, I take it?	1																					
41	43		301								Hassen	Originally, several, yes. But there's been a change of plans. One of the Ascendants, Gabriel, launched a surprise assault, so now I need you to go there and stop him.	2																					
42	44		301								Hassen	Of course, I've sent other squads too. And let me repeat this—the Ascendants are after the Gestalt-grade terminal within the light wall.	2																					
43	45		301								Hassen	Stop them at all costs. I'm counting on you.	2																					
44	46		302								Understood.	47	Can we really defeat the Ascendants?	48																				
45	47	49	301								Hassen	Good. Now take Ayla with you and go.	2																					
46	48		301								Hassen	Not like we can just surrender. But you know that already, 【kuroname】.	2

48	50		301							1	Liv	Oh, and President Hassen!	1																					
49	51		301								Hassen	Yes?	2																					
50	52		301								Liv	Who was it that saved us on the bridge?	1																					
51	53		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Hassen	They... are the fruits of our labor.	2
