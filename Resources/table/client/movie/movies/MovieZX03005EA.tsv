6	6		301									But that is not because things are getting better. On the contrary, the infection has greatly disrupted Bianca's sensors, turning the scorching pain into a summer breeze.																						
7	7		301									She remembers the Red Tide flooding over her. Her infection rate having long passed the safety threshold, she will not be surprised if she rises as a Corrupted at any moment.

12	12		301									Bianca feels an unprecedented calmness inside the silent darkness, but this silence threatens to drag her into an eternal sleep.

25	25		301									"She" presses against Bianca, caressing Bianca's cheeks with "her" bone-dry fingers.																						
26	26		301									The Punishing Virus around them is like "her" nutrients, gradually being absorbed by "her."																						
27	27		301									Devoured by the Red Tide earlier, Bianca is now resting in "her" arms and being taken to a safe place.																						
28	28		301								Bianca	...																						
29	29		301									Twisted as "her" face may be, Bianca still recognizes it.
