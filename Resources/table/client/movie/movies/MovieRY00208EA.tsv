12	12		301								???	Nanami, over here!	1																					
13	13		301									Inside the chaos, a hand grabs onto Nanami's arm and drags her out of the smoke.

50	50		301								Liv	I'm so sorry, Nanami... Because of the anomaly, everything we said back then came out opposite of what we actually meant.	2																					
51	51		301								Nanami	Even when Nanami replaced the matcha powder with wasabi powder in the dessert you made for Commandant?	1

65	65		301								Karenina	Hahahaha! That's splendid! That's probably karma, and you probably deserved it!	2

67	67		204							2																								
68	68		301									Karenina scratches her head, slightly embarrassed.																						
69	69		301								Karenina	When Nanami came to the Engineering Force and informed us about this, I was really angry... But then I calmed down and did some digging, and I did find some traces of suspicious programs...	2																					
70	70		204							1	1																							
71	71		301								Nanami	See! Nanami told you so!	1																					
72	72		301								Karenina	Fine, fine... I'm sorry I screwed up...	2																					
73	73		301								Nanami	What was that? I can't hear you!	1																					
74	74		301								Karenina	Enough with it... Because I was prepared, the Engineering Force managed to connect with Gestalt and came up with a solution when I was dragged to the virtual space, and we executed emergency repairs.	2																					
75	75		302								So that's how the malfunction on Liv and everyone was fixed...	76																						
76	76		301								Nanami	Then... what would happen to these abnormal programs...?	1																					
77	77		301								Karenina	The temporary solution is to isolate them from the anomaly. They are results from a bug in Gestalt, after all, so it's up to the Science Council and the folks upstairs eventually.	2																					
78	78		301								Karenina	It's starting...	2																					
79	79		301									A giant ebony crack appears behind the Queen Program, and all the abnormal programs are sucked inside.																						
80	80		302								Is that Gestalt's isolated drive?	81

85	85		302								Karenina, your body!	86																						
86	86		301									Karenina's body slowly turns translucent—as well as Liv beside her.

91	91		202							1	2				1																			
92	92		301									Indeed, both Lucia and Lee are almost completely gone, significantly weakening the attacks that hold the Queen Program back, giving her a moment of respite.

101	101		301							1	Chrome	Nanami, what are you doing?! Get out of there! It's dangerous!	1																					
102	102		301									Her chainsaw comes down on the Queen Program's arm, and the Queen Program sinks deeper into the crack behind the beautiful, metal-clashing sparks.																						
103	103		201							1	500324																							
104	104		301							1	Queen Program	Nanami<//#%?#%?>? Nanami<//#%?#%?>!	1																					
105	105		301									Seeing the Queen Program's expression, Nanami frowns, but her face is filled with pity.																						
106	106		201							1	500091	5																						
107	107		301							1	Nanami	You were born from an error, and so you wanted to create a world of falsehoods and mistakes.	1																					
108	108		301								Nanami	But you shouldn't have attacked those who don't approve of you. You should never take advantage of other people's kindness.	1																					
109	109		301								Nanami	People make mistakes... but people also reflect and change. So... go reflect on yours!	1																					
110	110		301			RImgBg1Shake						Nanami's chainsaw digs deep into the ground, and with a thunderous crack, a large piece of the floor is broken off. The spots that the Queen Program is holding on crumple, and soon she is entirely devoured by the crack.																						
111	111		301								Nanami	Maybe when we see each other again...	1																					
112	112		301									As the crack closes, the storm of data stream slowly dies down, leaving Nanami by herself in the empty square.
