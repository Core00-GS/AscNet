6	6		301									The Demon King and Liv were heading toward the next Demon General's Castle. Liv was a little concerned with the rapidly changing scenes around them.																						
7	7		301								Demon King	Of course. Don't you underestimate the power of Demon King.	1																					
8	8		301								Liv	Does this have anything to do with power...?	2																					
9	9		301								Demon King	Instead of worrying about the scenes, let's just hurry. We can't run again if there are enemies nearby. This is the only way to the castle.	1																					
10	10		301								Demon King	Two of us... No, you alone are no match for the guards if there are many of them.	1																					
11	11		301								Liv	I should have told others about the situation...	2																					
12	12		301								Demon King	Sorry, but the previous heroes of revelation left me a bad impression about you.	1																					
13	13		301								Demon King	Remember when we first met? I was trying to take you with violence.	1																					
14	14		301								Liv	Um-hum. I was really scared...	2																					
15	15		301								Demon King	Regretting won't help us. If your friends are as kind as you are, we will meet again eventually.	1

25	25		301								Demon King	Who are you...?	1																					
26	26		301									It was a red-haired Construct, followed by a male Construct in black. Vera and Camu walked toward them.																						
27	27		301								Liv	Vera, Camu, why are you here... Wait. Are you our enemy?	2																					
28	28		301									Liv was glad to meet more of her peers, but she immediately recalled something mentioned by the guards.

34	34		301							1	Demon King	Just like last time. I was hoping to meet you later. If only I can have the artifact...	1

36	36		301							1	Camu	The artifact is in our hands now.	1																					
37	37		301									Knowing what the Demon King was thinking, Camu took out a shiny gem fragment. Liv didn't know what it was, but the Demon King immediately recognized that it was the last piece of artifact.
