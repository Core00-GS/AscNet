15	15		301								Councilman A	If the minimum casualty rate of the Task Force is 87.1%, what's even the point of the plan, General Wells?	1																					
16	16		301								General Wells	This is the best I can do, given that you are not willing to deploy all of the Omega Weapons. If you have better suggestions, I'm all ears.																						
17	17		301								Councilman A	You have to lower the casualty rate to at most 20%. Babylonia does not have that many soldiers to waste!	1																					
18	18		202							1					1

20	20		301								Councilman C	Ahem...																						
21	21		301								Councilman C	We've already discussed that. To prioritize securing the lunar base, we must reserve half of the Omega Weapons before we are certain what the infection rate of the moon is.																						
22	22		301								General Wells	But no reconnaissance report has shown any sign of the Punishing Virus on the moon...																						
23	23		201							1	500340

25	25		301								Councilman B	If there is a sizable concentration of the Punishing Virus in the remaining areas and we don't have enough Omega Weapons, humanity can wave goodbye to the lunar base.	1																					
26	26		301								General Wells	That is just a guess...																						
27	27		301								Councilman B	We can't afford even a 1% chance! That is the lunar base! It is where we produce Omega Weapons! Are you going to gamble with humanity's future, General Wells?!	1

180	180		301								Nikola	As we all know, the production of Omega Weapon takes time. During this time window, numerous people will die. In other words, almost all humans living on the surface will be wiped out.	1																					
181	181		301								Nikola	We can still make it if we throw all the available resources in now. The proposal jointly developed by our advisors and the Science Council has taken into account the time required for the transport, handover, deployment and activation of Omega Weapons.	1																					
182	182		301								Nikola	But if we keep wasting our time here, this last chance would be lost. Once the Red Tide has developed to a certain extent, the available Omega Weapons we have cannot do anything to it.	1

195	195		301								Councilman B	Omega Weapon is mankind's future hope! How are we going to fight against the Punishing Virus if anything goes wrong in the lunar base?! Are we going to sacrifice another two eras to find another solution?	1
