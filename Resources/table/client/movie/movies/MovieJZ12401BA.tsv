5	5		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Light pierces through the heavy, impermeable clouds. Birds rise above the empty church as a sudden gust blows across.																						
6	6		301									The gust soon grows into a gale that catches the attention of every living thing, from crouching humans to fighting Constructs, even the creatures who were bred from the Red Tide have paused their slaughter. They all look at the light.																						
7	7		301									From the light, she descends.																						
8	8		301									She first sees with her eyes, then feels the Punishing Virus with her frame. The virus is floating in the air, and also present in the M.I.N.D. of Constructs and the data within the Red Tide.																						
9	9		301									The virus is entangled with infinite, noisy data. When she feels it, she also feels the agony and scream of thousands of souls.																						
10	10		301									She waves the scepter, letting the Punishing Virus rush into her M.I.N.D. along with all her painful emotions.																						
11	11		301									Her M.I.N.D. is immediately overwhelmed by the data torrent, but also infinitely extended. She floats in the space. Every satellite, every strain of the virus serves as her eyes. She is everywhere.																						
12	12		301									Her actions are no longer guided by her mind and memory, but by a duty-like instinct instead. With her specialized frame running at an extremely high frequency, her body becomes more brilliant each time she waves her scepter.																						
13	13		301									If the Punishing Virus is visualized, one may witness millions of the viruses form a tide in the air, rushing toward her like moths to a flame. She stands in the sky like a goddess of the sea, while the tide of Punishing surrounds her, engulfs her, then eventually disappears in her light.

31	31		301									Agony, despair, remorse—almost all the emotions and memories that the virus has ever caused on this planet have flooded in like a furious roar from the abyss, along with the distortion caused by corrupted data.																						
32	32		301									They turn into thorns that spread across her M.I.N.D., piercing into her heart like stakes.																						
33	33		301									Vital fluid surges from her chest. As her artificial heart continues to beat, more fluid comes out of her mouth and nose. She cannot tell whether it is vital fluid or the Red Tide.																						
34	34		301									Her vision starts to fade, but her consciousness is well awake. Unable to move, she can only wait for an ending like an angel crucified on rusty thorns.																						
35	35		301									She takes in all the information too hastily and feels like she has drowned in the river of eternity. Every thorn spike carries multiple memories. All are transmitted to her within an instant.																						
36	36		301									Countless lives are displayed in front of her. Memory data that belongs to different souls, related or unrelated to the Punishing Virus, has occupied her M.I.N.D.																						
37	37		301									The chest of a Construct is penetrated by a Corrupted that was once her friend. A wandering Scavenger jumps into the Red Tide to respond to his love. Inside a smoking forest, a lost child hugs a Hetero-Sapien who keeps calling him while piercing his body with its arm.																						
38	38		301									Every second is split into a thousand milliseconds, every millisecond is split into a thousand microseconds. She witnesses multiple lives within every unit of time. She stays with every soul on Earth.																						
39	39		301									Liv looks up. As her vision blurs, she sees a color other than the red that devours the sky. A gray bird flutters and stops on a branch nearby.																						
40	40		301									It tilts its head. Unlike other distorted data in her M.I.N.D., this bird feels like a living creature from the real world that accidentally ended up here.																						
41	41		301									She cannot tell the breed of the bird. Suddenly, it chirps and flaps its wings, pulling her into a data stream.

61	61		301									A magpie lands on a bush, but soon flies away as a hand waves.																						
62	62		301									I bend down to pick up a hairband left on the grass. I let out a sigh, then shout out loud.

67	67		301								??	Callie!																						
68	68		301									I walk over and see her sitting on the lawn, digging the soil with a mini shovel.																						
69	69		301									I squat down and take out my handkerchief to wipe out the mud on her cheeks.

73	73		301								??	Honeysuckles...	2																					
74	74		301									She answers in a serious manner.																						
75	75		301								??	Because winter is over. I want to plant honeysuckles all over this place to celebrate the passing of winter.	2																					
76	76		202							1	2				1																			
77	77		301								Mistress	Time to come home, □□□. Dinner's ready. Don't make Calliope look for you in the garden every time.																						
78	78		301									She immediately gets up hearing the Mistress' voice. I quickly put the hairband on her, so the Master won't rant about the importance of being presentable.

81	81		301							1	Young Mistress	I forgot to check the time again... Thanks, Callie.	2																					
82	82		301									Thanks to the Mistress' teaching, she is always very polite. I can't help but pat her on the head seeing her shy smile.																						
83	83		301								Calliope	My young lady, you should go eat now. I will keep watch the sprouts and make sure they aren't eaten by the sheep.	1																					
84	84		301								Young Mistress	Is that okay?	2																					
85	85		301									She is a little hesitant.																						
86	86		301								Young Mistress	But I want Callie to eat together with us... If Bell eats my flower, I will take her dinner away!	2																					
87	87		202							1	2				1																			
88	88		301									The Young Mistress loves gardening, so the Mistress lets her grow all sorts of plants in the back garden. Bell is the name of a sheep we saw in the market. It was going to be slaughtered, but the Young Mistress begged me to bring it back. The Mistress let her keep the sheep in the garden.																						
89	89		301									Somehow, I feel like my life is similar to this old sheep's.																						
90	90		301									My grandmother was a believer. She disregarded the advanced technologies in bionic machines and believed a devoted heart would prevail. Over time, our family fell behind the world, but she held on to the pride of the family until the very end.																						
91	91		301									Still, piety alone could not save a large family on the brink of collapse. After losing our home, we began wandering. I could not even find a job in a world full of amazing machines that I could hardly imagine. Nobody wanted to hire a person with zero knowledge about modern technologies.																						
92	92		301									"Machines may replace human labor, but they will never replace our beautiful souls." My mother used to say this to me a lot.																						
93	93		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					I think I have met one with a beautiful soul.																						
94	94		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory15.jpg																								
95	95		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						A few months ago, I was desperate in the bleak winter. Mistress saw me in the market and took me home. She offered me a job as a maid in this mansion.																						
96	96		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Despite not using cutting-edge technologies, the mansion is well decorated like a well-preserved time capsule from many years ago. Sometimes I even have the feeling that my religious grandmother would come out of a room all of a sudden, calling me by my nickname.																						
97	97		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory374.png																								
98	98		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						But when I cast the illusions off, I always see a smiling Mistress instead of the family that I remember.

102	102		301								Calliope	You say it every time.	1																					
103	103		301									I take her hand and walk toward the Mistress.																						
104	104		301								Young Mistress	I really mean it this time! Bell, don't eat my flowers!	2																					
105	105		202							1	2				1																			
106	106		301									Bell responds with a long "baa," and I chuckle. Mistress is wearing an elegant dress, smiling at us outside the garden. The spring sun shines upon her long silver hair, giving a soft and warm reflection.																						
107	107		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					I realize that spring has come.

114	114		401							1	207																							
115	115		301									Under the moon, I see her struggling to hug Bell with her arms open. She has tears in her eyes and has to bite her lips to not cry out.																						
116	116		301									I rush over and realize Bell is chewing her hair. Her face turns red from the pain, but she stays still as the sheep mistakes her hair for hay.																						
117	117		201							1	500342		450																					
118	118		201							2	500049		-450	-200	200

120	120		301									I quickly force the sheep to let go and shoo it away.																						
121	121		301								Calliope	Why didn't you call me?!	1																					
122	122		301								Young Mistress	...Sobs...	2																					
123	123		301								Young Mistress	But Bell has not eaten anything for two days... Will she get better if she eats my hair...?	2																					
124	124		301									She rubs her eyes. I see tears running down her cheeks.																						
125	125		301									I don't know what to say.																						
126	126		301									Bell is too long in the tooth. Most animals lose appetite in hot summer, why would an old sheep be any different? She has been very worried and keeping it company over the past few days.																						
127	127		301									But how can I explain life and death to a kid of her age? All I can do is wipe her tears in silence.																						
128	128		301								Calliope	Bell is just tired... It's preparing for a new journey. It just needs some good rest.	1																					
129	129		301								Young Mistress	A new journey...? Where is she going? Is she going to leave me?	2																					
130	130		301								Calliope	It can't stay in one place forever. My young lady, it's late now. Mistress would be worried if she can't find you. Can we go back first?	1																					
131	131		301								Young Mistress	Is Mother awake?	2																					
132	132		301									She lets go of her hands. Tears are still on her lashes. She starts to ask about her mother.																						
133	133		301								Young Mistress	Why is she always sleeping? Is she very tired?	2																					
134	134		301								Calliope	...She has been exhausted. She also needs to rest.	1																					
135	135		301									That is all I can say to her.																						
136	136		301								Calliope	But Mistress is awake now. She misses you a lot and wants to see you.	1																					
137	137		301									The medics in her room are probably gone by now.																						
138	138		301								Young Mistress	I miss her too. I want to ask her what to do when Bell doesn't eat! I'm sure she knows.	2																					
139	139		202							1	2				1																			
140	140		301									She becomes motivated again.																						
141	141		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Without a word, I take her hands, but deep in my heart, I am praying. Dear God, I devote my life to serving you, please treat these kind people nicely. How I wish the world can be restored to its former shape before the summer ends.

145	145		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The grievous news arrives on a gloomy autumn day.																						
146	146		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Mistress was a fighter. She stayed with us for several summers, but nobody thought she would be taken by an accident instead of the sickness.																						
147	147		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory519.png																								
148	148		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						When I rush to the hospital, I see Master sitting on a bench in the corridor, pulling his hair in anger and pain. Their marriage wasn't filled with a fiery passion, but I know how much they love each other after witnessing it for so many years.																						
149	149		301									I know what happened when I see his face and his tears. I feel dizzy as pain grips my heart.																						
150	150		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Struggling to hold my grief, I stagger inside the ward.																						
151	151		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory524.jpg																								
152	152		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The Young Mistress is sitting there, holding the Mistress' pale, slim hands covered under a white cloth. The very hands that took me out of winter, but left me in autumn. The pain is excruciating. I have to gather all my strength to not cry my heart out.																						
153	153		301									But another more excruciating pain strikes me the moment I see the Young Mistress' face.																						
154	154		301									I have never seen her so helpless. She tightens her grip on her mother's hand for one instant, then gives up as if she wants to wake her up, but does not want to interrupt her sleep.																						
155	155		301									She opens her mouth slightly, pale lips trembling. I see dried tear stains under her eyes. This child has lost her soul and does not know what to do for the rest of her life.																						
156	156		301									I only find out later that the Mistress lost her life in an accident on the way to the hospital when she tried to protect her daughter.																						
157	157		301									I cannot imagine what impact it could have on this kind, innocent child who loves her mother so deeply. Just thinking about it kills me inside.																						
158	158		301									The Young Mistress hears the noise I made. She turns around and sees me. She looks lost.																						
159	159		201							1	500049			-200	200																			
160	160		301							1	Young Mistress	Callie...	1																					
161	161		301									I see her mouth move as if she is about to burst into tears. But she holds it back and bites her lips instead. God, please bless this girl. She is unfortunate yet so strong.																						
162	162		301									She finally manages to ask me a question after a short pause. I hear her voice trembling.																						
163	163		301								Young Mistress	...Is Mother not going to wake up again? Just like Bell...?	1																					
164	164		301									I burst into tears and almost begin to hate myself for being not able to do anything.																						
165	165		301									I cry so hard that I cannot talk properly, but she seems to learn the truth anyway. She lowers her head, her hands clenching the white bedsheet hard.																						
166	166		301								Young Mistress	...Callie... Sorry... I couldn't take care of Mother...	1																					
167	167		202							1					1																			
168	168		301									She wipes her eyes with her sleeve, sobbing.

170	170		201							2	500049		-450	-200	200																			
171	171		301							1	Calliope	No! Don't say that! No way this is your fault...	1																					
172	172		301									I'm so shocked by her words and immediately argue back. Still sobbing, she looks up at me and forces herself to put up a smile.																						
173	173		301								Young Mistress	Sorry... Callie... I will take good care of you and Father...	2																					
174	174		202							1	2				1																			
175	175		301									The sorrow in her words, along with her fear that I would also leave one day, make me speechless.																						
176	176		301									In the name of God, I will never leave you... I want to make a thousand promises. I want to walk up and hug her, so she can let down her guard and cry it all out. But somehow I see Mistress in her miserable smile through my vision blurred by tears.																						
177	177		301									I don't know if it is an illusion, or if God really has heard my prayer. I see Mistress again. This great, beautiful lady descends into the ward, as kind and brilliant as when I first met her.																						
178	178		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Smiling, she puts her arms around the Young Mistress and kisses her on the forehead. She then disappears in the air, as if she had never been here.																						
179	179		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory385.png																								
180	180		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The Young Mistress used to have so many quirky dreams. She wanted to become a forest ranger, open a flower shop that keeps all sorts of animals or be a shepherd that helps soaked sheep stand up after rain. She never talks about them again.																						
181	181		301									The Master has a family business to pass down. The Mistress, who used to kindly preserve her naive dreams, is no longer around.																						
182	182		301									She starts to read books in her room all day and night. I have a vague feeling that the death of Mistress has given her a new direction.																						
183	183		301									The Master, on the other hand, becomes more depressed after losing his wife and locks himself in the study immediately after work. In the beginning, the three of us were still eating at the same table together, but such occasions become increasingly rare as he is "busy with work".																						
184	184		301									The Young Mistress seems to be troubled by guilt. She asks me to teach her some common dishes, and she would try her best to cook them and awkwardly take them to her father's study. But the response she gets is no different from what I always had—"Just leave it there."																						
185	185		301									I want to tell her that none of this is her fault. She should never blame herself.																						
186	186		301									But when I see her beautiful and loving eyes, they remind me of her mother. I know I cannot change anything.																						
187	187		301									I can only do my best to make her life more comfortable. I suggest her to write letters to the Mistress. It does make her happier, and I'm glad it works.																						
188	188		301									But as time goes by, things are not getting better. When winter falls, the chill seems to also have impacted the mansion.																						
189	189		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					It starts snowing early in the morning. The Young Mistress has not seen snow for a while, so I wake up early and take her to the garden. I finally see her innocent smile once again.																						
190	190		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory423.jpg																								
191	191		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						But Master summons me to his study. He stammers with an embarrassed look, telling me that he wants to order the most advanced management AI. I have a bad feeling about it.

195	195		301								Master	We can't stay in the old days forever... Science has changed the world.	2																					
196	196		301								Calliope	But you liked it that way when the Mistress was around, didn't you?	1																					
197	197		301									I panic and speak without thinking, but soon realize the mistake when his face darkens.																						
198	198		301								Calliope	...I'm sorry, Sir. I'm just concerned about you and Young Mistress...	1																					
199	199		301								Master	We're fine now. Besides, we need some time of our own...	2																					
200	200		301									The Master keeps looking away. It suddenly comes to my mind that he has been coming home late recently. I then recall the grayish-brown hair that I often found in his laundry, along with other signs...																						
201	201		301									I understand what he is trying to say.																						
202	202		301								Calliope	I see...	1																					
203	203		301									I look outside and see the Young Mistress making the shape of a sheep with snow in the garden. How I miss her smile.																						
204	204		301									Bell was buried right there. The Mistress and Young Mistress made her tombstone. I guess it's my time to embark on a new journey.																						
205	205		301								Calliope	Sir, she is a good young lady.	1																					
206	206		301									I can't think of anything more intelligent to say.																						
207	207		301								Calliope	Please take care of her.	1																					
208	208		301									The Master seems to be relieved and nods with a smile. Seeing him recover from the death of his wife is the only thing that can make me feel slightly better.																						
209	209		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Master	I will. Thank you, Calliope... It's been many years.	2

212	212		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Sorry, my young lady... I have failed to keep my promise. But as long as you and Master can live on happily...																						
213	213		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					I return to the winter that I came from.

216	216		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						I find a casual job not far from the mansion. The pay is far from decent, but I'm still concerned about the Young Mistress and want to be able to go back occasionally.																						
217	217		301									Life is never easy for ordinary people. Another season has passed when I have finally settled in.																						
218	218		301									One spring morning, I find the honeysuckles along the street blossoming on my way to work. The memory of the Young Mistress hits me so hard that I put down all the tools and rush through the entire neighborhood, heading toward her home.																						
219	219		301									I just want to see her from afar. I wonder how she is doing? Has her winter passed?																						
220	220		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The sun is high in the sky when I finally arrive outside the mansion. I wait anxiously, hoping to see her through the fences of the garden.																						
221	221		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory374.png																								
222	222		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Thank goodness I don't have to wait too long. I almost shout out in excitement when I see her walking to the garden with a pot in her hands.																						
223	223		201							1	500342																							
224	224		301							1	Calliope	Oh my... The Young Mistress... She has lost so much weight...	1																					
225	225		301									Sorrow grips my heart once again. I want to take her hand, wipe the mud off her face and give her a warm hug.																						
226	226		201							1	500049			-100	100																			
227	227		301									She no longer skips around. Her hairband is tied up properly. It has been only a few months, but I feel like she has grown so much. The innocent child is gone.																						
228	228		301									I gaze at the Young Mistress, trying to remember everything about her at this very moment. But I must not let her see me, for she would blame herself again after seeing me in dire straits—I told her I received a better job offer when I left.																						
229	229		301									She squats down next to the garden bed and starts digging with the same old mini shovel. I realize the garden has been renovated. All the flowers that she once grew are now gone, replaced by neat green foliage and automatic robot gardeners.																						
230	230		301									She continues to dig the soil. Her face looks as serious as before, but there is no longer mud on it.																						
231	231		301									I watch her move honeysuckle from a pot to the garden bed.																						
232	232		201							1	500052																							
233	233		301							1	??	Hey, is breakfast ready?	1																					
234	234		301									A girl that I have never met shows up in the window on the second floor. The Young Mistress looks up, slightly nervous.																						
235	235		201							1	500049			-100	100																			
236	236		301							1	Young Mistress	Yes, it's in the kitchen... Father starts work early today, so I only cooked for three people...	1																					
237	237		201							1	500052																							
238	238		301							1	??	Why are you still digging the mud? We're going to eat first.	1																					
239	239		202							1					1																			
240	240		301									Her face flushes red.																						
241	241		201							1	500049			-100	100																			
242	242		301							1	Young Mistress	Sure, sister. You can have it first...	1																					
243	243		202							1					1																			
244	244		301									The window is slammed shut.																						
245	245		301									I am beyond shocked. There are so many questions I want to ask. Why does Young Mistress have to make breakfast? Who is that girl?																						
246	246		301									She lowers her head and continues planting the seedling. She looks lonely and saddened.																						
247	247		201							1	500342

251	251		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						But what can I do? Confront the master of the mansion when I am no longer part of it?																						
252	252		301									Unable to do anything, I feel suffocated by the sense of guilt. I spend hours wandering outside the fence, but I could not gather the courage to step into the mansion. Ever since that day, I have never stopped regretting that I did not talk to the Young Mistress.																						
253	253		301									Every time I see her lonely look in my dream, I feel the urge to see her in person. But I never get to meet her again.																						
254	254		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The letters I sent to the Master were never given replies.																						
255	255		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory424.jpg																								
256	256		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After a few years, I finally settled down and opened a flower shop. It doesn't make a lot of money, but enough to keep myself fed.																						
257	257		301									I never hear anything from the Young Mistress. Still haunted by the guilt and uncertainty, I rarely go back to look for her again. Maybe she has already found her new family and friends. Maybe it was all just my misunderstanding.																						
258	258		301									Still, I put many of her favorite flowers in the window on the day my shop opens, hoping that one day she may come by.																						
259	259		401							1	36																							
260	260		301									Life is finally getting better. I am already looking forward to a day that I can go back and visit her. But doomsday comes soon after.

266	266		301									All I know about "Punishing" is that this virus can turn the machines we see every day into ruthless killers. All residents have fled the city. Machines are scrapped, abandoned on the streets. Government announcements are looped on screens. My flower shop looks like a God's joke.																						
267	267		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					I believe the Master will protect the Young Mistress. I can only think that way.

269	269		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory373.png																								
270	270		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						I go to her mansion one last time when I pack up my bags and prepare to head to the shelter.																						
271	271		301									From a distance, I see a military vehicle driving past the gate. Are they here to protect her? She will be fine.																						
272	272		301									I gaze at the now desolated garden. It is nothing like what I remember. Finally, I find the honeysuckle that Young Mistress planted many years ago.																						
273	273		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					It has completely dried up on the gray soil and looks more like a piece of a specimen. A white dove lands next to it, then chirps and flies away.																						
274	274		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory325.png																								
275	275		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						I have lost all sense of time in the wandering journey. Pain and suffering in the post-apocalyptic world have turned me into a numb and dull walking dead. Only memories can remind me of my life in the past as a human.																						
276	276		301									When I was a human, I could endure the pain. But in a world of the Punishing Virus, we are no longer humans, but animals that would do anything just to live another day.																						
277	277		301									Can I really see my loved ones here? That's the first thing that comes to my mind when the Red Tide devours my camp.																						
278	278		301									When other Scavengers scream and run, I only close my eyes, waiting for miracles to happen.																						
279	279		301									...I don't know if it is my illusion, or if God has actually descended.																						
280	280		301									I feel like I have seen the Mistress... I cannot see her face, but she gently puts her arms around me like an angel.																						
281	281		301									I open my arms to embrace her. This is my final relief. But when I see the angel's face, I know it must be a miracle, for she is not the Mistress, but a grown-up Young Mistress.																						
282	282		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					I know somewhere in the world, she must have become the person she always wants to be. I shed happy tears at the last moment of my life.
