6	6		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You open your eyes to find yourself in a corridor.																						
7	7		301									Looking at the furnishings, this seems to be an abandoned church. Most of the paint is peeled off, giving a discordant feeling to the room. A faint song, sung by children, can be heard from beyond the wall.																						
8	8		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You move through the corridor, and hear some people speaking at the end of it.																						
9	9		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Boy?	I already ate all of it! What do you want me to do?

27	26		302								Luna, come to yourself!	27

36	34		301								Luna	If I kill you here—kill everyone here—I can remove my weakness.	1																					
37	996		301								Luna	If I do so, I'll become the most formidable agent. I can protect Lucia and live with her in a new world.	1																					
38	35		302								That will cause your M.I.N.D. to collapse!	995

69	54		301				DialogDisable					She trembles. A certain human holds onto her hand, and the dagger falls from her grip. The children around scream at her, calling her a monster, and run away.																						
70	56		302								...I don't know what's right.	57																						
71	57		302								But I know that... this is what I'd do.	58

80	67		301									You know full well that when you wake from this dream, you will both return to reality—return to being enemies, return to your duties... But...																						
81	68		302								At the very least, for you right now...	69																						
82	69		302								You deserve a better dream.	70

92	80		301									Under the glimmering light of the small room, Luna's thin lips seem to have curled into a faint smile on her pale face.
