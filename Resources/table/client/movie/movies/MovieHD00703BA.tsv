4	4		301									The children you saw running before are now gathered there, keeping busy among themselves.																						
5	5		301									Watanabe slows down his pace, and you are confused about what he is intending.

10	10		301							1	Ann	That's about the right amount... And then it's up to how fast we can act. Or else we'll get discovered.	3																					
11	11		301								Deckard	Is it because of the "supplier"? I heard from my uncle about some product testing... That's why Uncle Watanabe and the others are heading out.	2																					
12	12		301								Ann	...But if you think about it, the supplier also has it pretty rough, having to work at a time like this.	3																					
13	13		301								Xiuyong	Wait, it should go like this... like this! Twist this, and then... Argh!	1																					
14	14		301								Ann	You're right, but don't fold it with so much force! Gently!	3																					
15	15		301								Deckard	How about it we hang it right outside the entrance? They can see it once they come back...	2																					
16	16		301								Ann	And this one too! We can glue this by the gate!																						
17	17		302								What are you doing?	18	(Approach quietly with Watanabe)	20																				
18	18		301									All the children turn around at the same time, the excitement on their faces barely hidden.																						
19	19	21	301									The little girl is the first one to react. She steadies herself and watches you approach nervously.																						
20	20		301									Maybe it is the sound of your footsteps or your wavering shadow that has warned them, but the children immediately notice your presence. They are surprisingly alert.																						
21	21		301									They only relax until they realize that it is Watanabe who is heading toward them.																						
22	22		401							1	208																							
23	23		301								Deckard	Uncle Watanabe! Oh, and the supplier!	2																					
24	24		301								Xiuyong	Aren't you going on a mission, Uncle Watanabe?	1																					
25	25		301									Xiuyong and Deckard deliberately step forward, blocking Ann and the things she is holding in her arms from your view.																						
26	26		301									Watanabe acts like he has not noticed what they did, and he crouches to their height with a solemn and respectful expression.

29	29		301							1	Watanabe	I am, but that is going to take a while to prepare, so I am here to check and see how your mission's going.	1																					
30	30		201							1	500279																							
31	31		301							1	Deckard	...Even so, you should have said something. It's pretty rude to just sneak up on us!	1																					
32	32		201							1	1101001	1																						
33	33		301							1	Watanabe	Your enemies won't greet you before they sneak up on you. I'll let you off this time since it's your first mistake, but not a second time, got it?	1

41	41		301									The girl hiding behind them suddenly speaks, standing on her toes to look at Watanabe between the two boys.																						
42	42		301									The boys notice Watanabe's gaze shifting, and they move up to keep the girl hidden.

45	45		301							1	Xiuyong	So, Uncle Watanabe... I mean, Sir! Are you here to give us a new mission, Sir?	1																					
46	46		301								Deckard	We have finished mowing and patrolling as you ordered, Sir! We're free to take new missions now!	2

49	49		301							1	Watanabe	Smart kids. You're right, I've got a new mission for you.	1																					
50	50		301									Watanabe stands and turns to you with a very friendly wink.																						
51	51		301								Watanabe	As you know, this is 【kuroname】, our supplier who just arrived.	1																					
52	52		301								Watanabe	Your job is simple—	1																					
53	53		301								Watanabe	I'm heading out for the tests very soon. Once I leave with the adults from the combat team, you're in charge of keeping an eye on our supplier from wandering inside our camp. Understood?	1																					
54	54		302							946	Hold on, what about our mission?	57	I... am the mission?	59

57	57		301								Watanabe	What are you even talking about? The Forsaken never asks a guest in the camp to partake in a mission!	1																					
58	58	61	301									Watanabe smiles, slyly.																						
59	59		301								Watanabe	More or less. Think of it as a cooperative mission.	1																					
60	60		301									Watanabe shrugs, smiling slyly.																						
61	61		202							1					1																			
62	62		301									His comms ring right after he finishes speaking.																						
63	63		301									Watanabe turns away from the three curious children, one of his hands spontaneously petting one of their heads.

70	70		301									Watanabe just gives him a slight nod before ending the conversation. And then he leans in toward the children again with his serious face.																						
71	71		201							1	1101001																							
72	72		301							1	Watanabe	Do you understand your missions, Forsaken reserves?	1

77	77		301									Their mannerism is far from the military standard, but the children still sound quite authentic in front of Watanabe.																						
78	78		301									Watanabe straightens up, patting the children's heads one by one, then he turns to look at you and speaks again.

81	81		301							1	Watanabe	Simply put, you'll stay here with them when we're out collecting data.	1																					
82	82		301								Watanabe	They're an energetic bunch. I'm sure you'll keep each other occupied, and I won't have to worry about you wandering in my camp.	1																					
83	83		302								I'm not a kid!	84	Are you hiding something here?	85																				
84	84	86	301								Watanabe	See, an adult wouldn't have said that.	1																					
85	85		301								Watanabe	Maybe, maybe not. As your business partner, I simply don't think my supplier needs to go nosing about other people's business.	1																					
86	86		301								Watanabe	Stay awake, stay energized, 【kuroname】. Good luck.	1																					
87	87		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Watanabe	We'll be heading out, and I'll try to get it done as soon as possible. I'll see you later.	1
