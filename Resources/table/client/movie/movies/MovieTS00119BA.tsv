5	5		301								Watanabe	Those who're trapped inside are on the Purifying Force's kill list.	1																					
6	6		301								Watanabe	It's already difficult to rescue someone in a heavily guarded place...	1																					
7	7		301								Watanabe	It's not going to end well for my men if Bianca and her team get involved as well.	1																					
8	8		301								Watanabe	(Looks around) If I had built this place, I would've put the cells at the lowest level.	1																					
9	9		301								Watanabe	If I can find a map of this place, not only will I locate the cells, but I can also avoid all these guards on the way.	1																					
10	10		301								Watanabe	Speaking of which... this has been quite an eye-opening rescue op.	1																					
11	11		301								Watanabe	I can't believe such a sanctuary would still exist on Earthâ€”the level of Punish Virus concentration here is way too low.	1																					
12	12		301								Watanabe	That's probably what Bianca is after here...	1																					
13	13		301								Watanabe	Which means there are other teams here apart from her.	1

16	16		301								Watanabe	He wouldn't stop, no matter how many lives of his soldiers it costs him.	1

18	18		301							1	Watanabe	...Nikola is a piece of shit, but he's no gambler.	1																					
19	19		301								Watanabe	He must've held some concrete intel to send the Purifying Force. It means that this antidote may actually be real...	1																					
20	20		301								Watanabe	A cure... to the Punishing Virus...	1																					
21	21		301								Watanabe	...	1																					
22	22		301								Watanabe	...	1																					
23	23		301								Watanabe	No cure is more important than the lives of my people.	1																					
24	24		301								Watanabe	I'll leave saving the world to Babylonia.	1																					
25	25		301								Watanabe	Now...	1
