3	3		301			DialogEnable						On the bridge, Chi Ling headshots a Musashi VI opposite of them, then charges forward with two Pulao soldiers to cover Qu and then retreat behind the defensive line.

5	5		301									When the three approach, Qu grabs a rifle from a Pulao soldier and empties the clip under the bridge.																						
6	6		301									Once the gunfire stops, the roar from the Corrupted falls silent.																						
7	7		301									Qu hands the rifle back to the soldier who is left speechless.

10	10		301								Qu	Regroup and check each team for damages.	1																					
11	11		301									After giving the order, Qu takes the soldiers back to the human frontline below the city wall. The defensive turrets destroy hordes of Corrupted with each volley.																						
12	12		201							1	500223																							
13	13		301							1	Pulao Crew A	The Corrupted can't even get close thanks to all the suppressive fire from Baxia's turrets...	1

16	16		301			RImgBg1Shake						Suddenly, the blast from a cannon crosses the broken bridge and crashes into the frontline. The soldier is thrown to the ground mid-sentence...																						
17	17		301									The blast can be seen coming from a Musashi VI that has stopped working, despite still being in a firing position with only its upper body left.																						
18	18		301									Laying on the ground, the shell-shocked soldier opens his mouth in surprise to see that he is still alive despite being near the impact point.

23	22		301									A mouthful of warm blood falls on the soldier's cheek. He looks up to see that Chi Ling had protected him just now.																						
24	23		301									However, Chi Ling's left arm is badly burned by the explosion. Blood spills down the corner of his mouth, dripping on the soldier beneath him.																						
25	24		301									Watching from behind, Qu rushes over.																						
26	25		201							1	500220	4																						
27	26		301							1	Qu	Medic! Chi Ling needs medical attention.	1

29	28		301							1	Chi Ling	I'm fine.	1																					
30	29		301									Chi Ling raises his right hand to wipe the blood from the corner of his mouth and waves at Qu to stop her from calling a medic.																						
31	30		301									The soldier on the ground quickly gets up and trembles to help Chi Ling lean up against a barrier for cover.																						
32	31		301								Chi Ling	Thanks.	1																					
33	32		301									Chi Ling leans back and pats the soldier on the shoulder.																						
34	33		301								Chi Ling	Don't lower your guard on the battlefield. Go, I'm not dying so easily yet.	1

42	41		301								Chi Ling	It's okay. Just a flesh wound. I don't want to retreat from the frontline like this.	2																					
43	42		301									Chi Ling takes out his tactical knife from his belt and begins to quickly cut off the charred portion of his left arm.																						
44	43		301			PanelActor2Shake				1	Chi Ling	Nngh... Ugh.	2																					
45	44		301									Chi Ling quickly takes a deep breath, then expertly wraps the neatly cut portion on his arm in gauze.

47	45		301								Chi Ling	Don't worry, Lady Qu. It'd just get in the way.	2																					
48	46		301								Qu	You haven't changed a bit.	1																					
49	47		301								Chi Ling	Hehe, returning to formation.	2																					
50	48		301									Seeing Chi Ling's expression, Qu knew in her heart that she could never persuade him to retreat.																						
51	49		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	Alright, let's get going.	1
