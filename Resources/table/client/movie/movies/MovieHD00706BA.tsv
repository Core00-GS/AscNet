4	4		301									Watanabe departed a while ago due to his allegiance, while the people you are meeting have already arrived at the outpost, according to the message you received.																						
5	5		301									The headlights from your vehicle light up the entrance to the outpost, and you find two female Constructs standing there, waiting for you.

8	8		301							1	Bianca	【kuroname】. Happy to see you again.	2																					
9	9		302								...It's been a while.	10	The pleasure is mine.	12																				
10	10		301								Karenina	Better we see you less! After all, every time we run into you... some weird shit's gonna happen.	1																					
11	11	13	301								Karenina	...But nothing unusual this time, luckily. You'll have to travel with us for the remaining journey.	1																					
12	12		301								Bianca	I know it might be a bit unexpected, but Karen and I will be accompanying you and supporting you for the rest of your assignment.	2																					
13	13		301								Bianca	Please don't take it the wrong way. We're here for the same reason you are. As to where we've been... just consider our meeting a coincidence.	2																					
14	14		301								Karenina	Obviously. We are definitely not here because of how bothersome Gray Raven has been or because Lucia asked us to.	1																					
15	15		301								Bianca	Also, Asimov has talked to us, and before he gathers all the test data, you're in charge of bringing our test mechanoid back to Babylonia as well.	2																					
16	16		301								Karenina	It's simple—we're all heading back to Babylonia. Nothing weird for us to share a ride.	1																					
17	17		202							1	2				1																			
18	18		301									As Karenina speaks, Bianca has already opened a comms channel.																						
19	19		301									Although you cannot tell who she is talking to, judging by her phrases and expression, the person on the other end is surely someone important in Babylonia.																						
20	20		301									Bianca does not turn back immediately after the call has ended. A Construct stationed at the outpost steps forward and talks to her.																						
21	21		201							1	1111001																							
22	22		301							1	Karenina	...It's one thing for Constructs to have no holidays at all. It's another to ask you to go on a mission at this time of the year.	1																					
23	23		301								Karenina	What an odd fella, that Asimov. What's the obsession with data?	1																					
24	24		302								A mission is a mission.	25	Thanks for your hard work, Karenina.	26																				
25	25	29	301								Karenina	True. It's an emergency mission, after all. And I don't dislike this cute little critter.	1																					
26	26		204							1	5																							
27	27		301								Karenina	Don't say shit like this all of a sudden! What am I, a child?	1																					
28	28		204							1																								
29	29		301								Karenina	I'm quite familiar with the development of the CUBs. After all, I was responsible for developing the power system...	1																					
30	30		301									Karenina carefully goes through and examines the CUB after receiving it. The level of attention is not far from a professional's.																						
31	31		301								Karenina	The completed version is even more detailed than I thought... I hope the Forsaken bunch didn't break the damn thing... or implanted some weird shit on it...	1																					
32	32		302								You're overthinking things.	33																						
33	33		301								Karenina	(Chuckles) Who knows? It's never smart to trust someone blindly... How the hell have you survived to this day?	1																					
34	34		302								So have you found anything?	35																						
35	35		301								Karenina	Not yet... But! Those Forsaken...	1

37	37		201							2	1091001		400																					
38	38		301							1		Karenina is going to continue before Bianca returns and stops her.																						
39	39		301								Bianca	The results of the CUB project will be inspected by Asimov... We don't have to get involved.	2																					
40	40		301								Bianca	Our mission is also assigned with similar concerns, so we don't have to reveal too much. Also... I just talked to the other team members, and I've received some unexpected intel.	2																					
41	41		301								Karenina	...Intel? Bianca, what kind of intel?	1																					
42	42		301								Bianca	We'll discuss the details after we've entered the guard post in City 015 proper.	2																					
43	43		302								The conservation area?	44																						
44	44		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Bianca	Let's find something to do before you're back on Babylonia.	2

49	49		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The road to the conservation area outpost is calm and quiet. The track has been repaired, so the journey is far from tiring.																						
50	50		301									Apart from an argument on who gets to drive the vehicle, everything has been going smoothly.																						
51	51		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Suffice to say, the saying "Don't let Karenina go near the cockpit!" probably originates here.

54	54		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Once you have arrived in City 015, Karenina disappears the moment she leaves the vehicle.																						
55	55		201							1	1091001																							
56	56		301							1	Bianca	If there's nothing else to attend to, maybe we'll speak in length later about what we mentioned in the outpost, Commandant.	1																					
57	57		302								We'll talk later, then.	58																						
58	58		301								Bianca	By the way... Have you seen where Karenina has gone to? I might have missed her when we arrived.	1																					
59	59		302								Now that you mention it, I haven't seen her either...	60																						
60	60		201							1	500019																							
61	61		301							1	Construct A	Miss Bianca, are you talking about the girl in the hood?	1																					
62	62		301								Construct A	She has left for the old commercial district in the city.	1																					
63	63		301								Construct A	We showed her this when you were unpacking.	1																					
64	64		202							1					1																			
65	65		301									Bianca takes the sample the Construct passes her and examines it. The graffiti on the box looks familiar.																						
66	66		301									After identification, you are almost certain that it matches the graffiti previously found in City 015.																						
67	67		201							1	500019																							
68	68		301							1	Construct A	I'm sure you've heard about it before you arrived at our guard post?	1																					
69	69		201							1	1091001																							
70	70		301							1	Bianca	(Nods) ...That's what I wanted to talk to you about.	1																					
71	71		301								Bianca	The graffiti symbol and the unusual Corrupted activities that follow its trail signify a Corrupted whose function has advanced beyond the norm. The target might be self-aware.	1																					
72	72		301								Bianca	Despite ruling out many possibilities, there is still something that... concerns me.	1																					
73	73		301								Bianca	There was a similar Corrupted in the past—"Nozzle", the one that only 【kuroname】 here has come into contact with before.	1																					
74	74		301								Bianca	For safety reasons, I was hoping to invite you to investigate with me to make sure we can keep everything under control. But Karen... she really is an impulsive one.	1																					
75	75		301								Bianca	Commandant, I know this is not your duty, but can I ask for your assistance before the extraction team from Babylonia arrives?	1																					
76	76		302								Graffiti symbols...	77	Unusual Corrupted activities...	78																				
77	77	79	301								Bianca	As the only commandant who has made contact with one, I'm sure you still remember it.	1																					
78	78		301								Bianca	It is an unverified "phenomenon," and there's no way for us to confirm the accuracy and authenticity of the intel...	1																					
79	79		301								Bianca	Both of these concerns call for a more secure approach. We'll count on you for the operation ahead of us.	1																					
80	80		301									As Bianca tries to locate Karenina with her comms, Karenina calls her.

84	84		301							1	Bianca	Karenina?! Where did you go? Have you gone investigating the graffiti symbols by yourself?!	1																					
85	85		301								Karenina	The symbols are real, but you don't have the slightest clue what it actually is.	2																					
86	86		301								Bianca	What it actually is? Are you saying that the graffiti points to something else entirely?	1																					
87	87		301								Karenina	That's why I have to call you—	2																					
88	88		301								Karenina	Bianca can see my coordinates, right? I'll be waiting for you there in 15 minutes! Now, move! I don't like waiting!	2																					
89	89		301								Bianca	Hello? Hey? Karen?! Sigh... she hung up.	1																					
90	90		302								I guess we'll have to go there?	91																						
91	91		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Bianca	Apparently. She's even brought the CUB with her... What is she up to?	1
