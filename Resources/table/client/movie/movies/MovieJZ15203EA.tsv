8	8		301								Villier	Got that right. Its anti-tracking software is really sophisticated, too. Redundant code is generated every 10 minutes to hide the malicious code.	1																					
9	9		301								Villier	They must have planned this for some time. Had it not been for my habit of always leaving a backdoor in all of my programs, I wouldn't have been able to figure out what was wrong.	1																					
10	10		301								Qu	Only a handful of people in Kowloong have the authority and technology to pull something like this off.	2																					
11	11		301								Villier	Got that right. Either the hackers I took care of last year or the members of the Chaofeng Crew you took in.	1																					
12	12		301								Villier	Aside from those few, there's gotta be someone with high security coverage.	1																					
13	13		301								Qu	...	2																					
14	14		301								Villier	Got it. This is the work of "Cradle".	1																					
15	15		301								Villier	Looks like this hacker organization is finally reemerging in Kowloong after supposedly dying years ago.	1

36	28		301									Seeing Villier fraught with anger, I'm suddenly overcome with ideas never to have crossed my mind.																						
37	29		301									Humans have an array of emotions far more profound than just a single noun in a set of data.																						
38	30		301									Brother's fear and anger, Villier's loneliness and disgust, and the family's love and gratification—all intertwined with each other.																						
39	31		301									I overflow with emotional ties, none of which stem from the heart.																						
40	32		301									My family taught me humility, and humility abstains oneself from brandishing this word.																						
41	33		301									But perhaps I am as perfect as Villier and the others say. I'm always able to respond to others with the appropriate attitude and meet their expectations.																						
42	34		301									This has been my duty since birth—to be a lonely, powerful, and false Supreme.																						
43	35		301									The Supreme is a mere facade, weaved through lies to dance for the masses.																						
44	36		301									I will fulfill my family's mission, live up to the expectations of the people, and refrain from any actions ill-suited for the Supreme.																						
45	37		301									A ruin devoid of warmth lies beneath my shell, drowned in indifference.																						
46	38		301									To fill these emotionless ruins, I try my best to imitate and show concern for others in an attempt to understand the deeper meaning contained in these words, so I can try my best to act like a normal person.																						
47	39		301									But the repairs I've made on these ruins merely end up disappearing into the sea without a trace.
