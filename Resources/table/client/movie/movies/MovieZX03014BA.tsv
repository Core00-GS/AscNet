76	76		301								Asimov	As for Stigmata... Its abilities have already been fully demonstrated in battle. I let Bianca change out of it because the Punishing Virus information inside the frame has yet to be completely neutralized. Using it will make her M.I.N.D. more unstable.	1																					
77	77		301								Asimov	A thorough tuning is necessary before it can be used again.	1

80	80		301									Asimov taps on the light screen. A core fragment appears in the center. Looks like it was formed from Punishing Virus Heteromers.																						
81	81		302								Does it have anything to do with Chiko?	82	Does it have anything to do with Ascendants?	82																				
82	82		301								Asimov	No. The fragment appears to be merely a vessel for transmitting information. What really matters is the message it carries.	1																					
83	83		301								Asimov	It almost feels like someone was purposely using the fact that the Punishing Virus could carry information... Actually, there's more than that. I must have overlooked something more important.	1

90	90		401							2	2566																							
91	91		301									Asimov raises his hand, displaying the information to the screen. They seem like just a few pages of cryptic codes to you.																						
92	92		301									Only one obscure message was deciphered from the codes.																						
93	93		302								"This is a gift... in the name of the future."	94																						
94	94		301								Asimov	I don't know what it really means.	1																					
95	95		301									The message does not quite make sense, but that familiar gray-haired girl suddenly appears in your mind. She waves at you with a bright smile, then walks away into the dazzling light.																						
96	96		302								(Speaking of it... You haven't seen her for a long time.)	97																						
97	97		301								Asimov	Anyway, there are still a lot of unsolved mysteries regarding this fragment. I will continue analyzing it.	1																					
98	98		201							1	500011	5																						
99	99		301							1	Hassen	Apart from the fragment, the production of Omega Weapons also needs to be prioritized. We have almost used up all the available inventory in this battle.	1

101	101		204							1																								
102	102		301								Hassen	But we won.	1																					
103	103		301									Hassen's brow seems to have relaxed a bit. He points to the casualty rate displayed on the screen. The final number is even lower than Gestalt's estimate.																						
104	104		301								Hassen	Like you said, the people who bring us hope are our most important resources.	1																					
105	105		301								Hassen	The battle outcome is exactly like what we estimated. Most of the participants have survived. There is no better victory than this.	1																					
106	106		201							1	500004																							
107	107		301							1	Asimov	The only regret is we could not retrieve Lithos' frame.	1

109	109		301							1	Bianca	I was already getting close to where Lithos sank, but a large number of Hetero-Creatures suddenly appeared from the sea. When we cleared them up, his frame had already disappeared.	1																					
110	110		301								Bianca	Thinking back now, the Hetero-Creatures were probably...	1																					
111	111		302								They purposely showed up to transfer Lithos' frame away before you got ahold of it.																							
112	112		301								Bianca	Correct. The only party that could do this was...	1

143	143		301								Asimov	Rosa?	1

145	145		301									The box is carefully opened and put aside. Asimov looks at it and recalls the coincidental encounter between Rosa and Noan not long ago.																						
146	146		301									...He did not want to bring up the "unimportant" past, but he had forgotten that Rosa had always wanted to know the truth behind some things.

253	253		401							2	2566																							
254	254		301									She picks up the damaged small terminal and opens an image folder hidden with a commandant's highest permission level.																						
255	255		301									There are only a few images in the folder. Her hand pauses on the latest one.

269	269		301									Vanessa waves her recording terminal.																						
270	270		301								Vanessa	Gray Raven had a photo like this. Let's take one too for our final time together.	2																					
271	271		301									Nobody expects her to say such words on a battlefield full of potential threats of Hetero-Creature.																						
272	272		301								Teasell	...A photo?	1																					
273	273		301								Teasell	Fine then. This is the last time anyway.	1																					
274	274		301									Teasell cannot understand why his former commandant wants to take a photo of a traitor, but he no longer has any desire to find out the reasons behind Vanessa's changes. He has already made up his mind to leave them.

280	280		301									Teasell just turns sideways and crosses his arms. He keeps a poker face, but has not left.																						
281	281		301									Vanessa raises her terminal to put both of them in the viewfinder. Seeing the terminal's screen, she makes another breezy smile, but never presses the shutter.																						
282	282		301									What is she waiting for? Teasell looks over in confusion. Bambinata just keeps her hand up helplessly, maintaining the pose.

288	288		301									Completely unaware of Vanessa's gaze, Liv rushes directly to the wounded Constructs. Vanessa cannot see her face, but she can easily imagine her expression.																						
289	289		301									It must be that same firm, determined look that once made her laugh. Just like when she cut off her long hair in the factory ruins, or when she said "I won't flee" in the ambulance.																						
290	290		301									The Gray Raven in that ambulance reminded Vanessa of Teasell, who had gone missing. She has seen many "dolls" who died or fled from her hands, but never thought that one of them would come back and save her life.

295	295		301									—Bambinata is still submissive, but Teasell no longer obeys orders. Vanessa still does not want to be in the photo. With Liv in the distance, the once glorious Egret has their first and last photo.

314	314		301							1		Bambinata comes to Vanessa and helps her walk. She looks back at Teasell for one last time.

329	329		301								Doctor	The results are out. Your recovery is progressing well.	1																					
330	330		301								Doctor	But the wound on your face may take some time to heal.	1																					
331	331		301								Doctor	As for your left eye... Unfortunately, it was wounded too badly and didn't receive timely treatment. Its vision is completely lost and cannot be recovered.	1																					
332	332		301								Doctor	...But considering your situation at that time, this is already the best outcome.	1																					
333	333		301								Doctor	I suggest you have the eyeball removed as soon as possible to avoid sympathetic ophthalmia. Once it's out, you can consider installing a prosthetic one.	1																					
334	334		301									Celica thought Vanessa would blow up for this, but she just waves her hand as if she does not care at all.

340	340		301									She casually runs her fingers through the hair on the side, giving her usual sarcastic smile.																						
341	341		301								Vanessa	Hope that Chief can regret lying down for 3 months and doing nothing after seeing my face.	1

345	345		301							1		Vanessa just sneers disdainfully.																						
346	346		301								Vanessa	If that Chief insists to apologize and thank me, I don't mind accepting it.	1																					
347	347		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Vanessa	But I hope that Chief can show some sincerity and stand for at least an hour before coming in.	1

358	358		302								I know.	359	(Sigh)	362																				
359	359		301									The medic Construct mentioned the long-lost Vanessa showing up at the temporary command center, seriously wounded. She was in a coma for quite some time due to infection after being sent back to Star of Life.																						
360	360		301									When Vanessa appeared, she never talked about her injuries or what happened in the past few months. She just provided tactical assistance to the surrounded soldiers with Bambinata until the battle ended.																						
361	361	363	301									After joining the main force, she was sent to Star of Life. She was once in a coma due to serious infection.																						
362	362	364	301									Liv and Lucia had also told you the stories in City 043 long ago.

387	387		301								Vanessa	What?!

426	426		301									Vanessa is mostly the same as how you remember her, but with subtle differences. She is dressed in a glamorous gown that looks out of place and wearing near flawless makeup.

427	427		301									Still, you can see the horrifying scars under the mask if you look carefully.																						
428	428		301								Vanessa	What are you looking at? Are you tired of your own eye too?	1
