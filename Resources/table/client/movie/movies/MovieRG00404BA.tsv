7	7		301							1	Lee	So... we're having a dinner party out in the wilds? Why not at the settlement?	1

10	10		301							1	Diana	The Arctic is sparse in vegetation. If we light such a large bonfire at the settlement, that would give away our position.	1																					
11	11		301								Diana	The small ones we usually light won't be visible more than three kilometers away, but bonfires used for banquets like this... Those can be seen fifty kilometers away.	1

17	17		301							1	Diana	But, since we're doing it out here, more than half of the representatives from New Murmansk can come. Such a large banquet is quite the rare occurrence for the ARU.	1

20	20		301							1	Lucia	Diana, did you just say a bonfire? But...	1																					
21	21		202							1																								
22	22		201							1	500088																							
23	23		301							1	Diana	Yep. The bonfire will be lit when it's almost nighttime. The firelight and smoke will be more beautiful out on the snowfield in the evening.	1																					
24	24		301								Diana	Even if it's such a special occasion, we don't want to waste precious fuel.	1																					
25	25		301									Suddenly, a figure exits out of the woods.

32	32		301							1	???	Me! It's me!																						
33	33		301									Realizing his hair and felt hat are covered in snow, branches, and pine leaves, the boy lowers his head and shakes himself clean.																						
34	34		301								Evan	It's me! Evan!	1

40	40		301							1	Evan	I'm not! Granny Anna wanted me to go collect pine leaves to make tea!	1

42	42		201							1	500088																							
43	43		301							1	Diana	So you walked all the way here from the Maria? Aren't there at least two pine forests along the road?	1																					
44	44		202							1																								
45	45		201							1	500198																							
46	46		301							1	Evan	...Um.	1

49	49		301							1	Liv	Anyway, no more running around now that you're with us.	1																					
50	50		301									With that, Liv brings Evan to her side and wipes the snow and pine needles off his hair with her sleeves.
