25	62		301									A massive crane zooms past you and the others. Luckily, you all duck just in time.

39	76		301							1	Lee	The central AI must have repurposed the freight systems to deal with the Corrupted nearby...	3																					
40	77		301							1	Lucia	That must be why we see so few Corrupted the closer we get to the center.	1
