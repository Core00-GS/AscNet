13	12		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Host	It is the autumn in an age of prosperity...																						
14	13		301								Host	And today, attending our stage of "Paragon Sovereign", are dignitaries and ladies with insight and appreciation for the arts...																						
15	14		301								Host	And wherefore? Because a rare performance graces the "Paragon Sovereign" tonight!																						
16	15		301								Host	...As you all know, we have a play that has been shelved for quite some time. Only when the right actor is cast, can it take to the stage.																						
17	16		301								Host	...Those clapping in the audience, you must be a scholar in plays! The last time this was performed, I was still in my nappies!																						
18	17		301								Host	To tell you the truth, we hit a stroke of luck in raising a new actor. He may be new to the stage, but his moves! His alacrity! You can tell that he's the real deal at a glance!																						
19	18		301								Host	Without further ado, feast your eyes folks! Raise the curtains...																						
20	19		301									As the curtain rises, gongs and drums roar on the stage. The expectant audience falls into silence. The stage quickly erupts into a battlefield as soldiers with various weapons appear onstage.																						
21	20		301								Commander	Yaaah‚Äî‚Äî!																						
22	21		301									The commander storms the camp's colorful gate waving his spear. It collides with the enemies' blades; their faces press against each other. Suddenly, the enemies are sent somersaulting, their braids flying in the air.																						
23	22		301								Scholar	Your Majesty‚Äîthe Iron City is in peril. Without any soldiers to break through their formation‚Äî																						
24	23		301								Scholar	The city gates‚Äîwill be open to the rebels!																						
25	24		301								His Majesty	My people! Who is willing‚Äîto heed the call‚Äîand quell this rebellion?																						
26	25		301								???	I shall go!																						
27	26		301									The music stops abruptly. The warriors, scholar, commander, and the emperor shift their gazes to a figure that has leaped onto the stage.

29	28		301							1	Young Lad	I might just be a mere civilian, but I have earned myself a name of "Black Guardian" in the streets. I volunteer!	1																					
30	29		301								His Majesty	You might don humble robes, but you are one of good heart!																						
31	30		301								Young Lad	I come bearing the will of my friend. I have fought with rebels on my way here, and suffered much. Yet so, I only wish to defeat the rebels so as to comfort my friend's spirit in Heaven!	1																					
32	31		301								Young Lad	If you send me, the rebels will surely underestimate me due to my age. Then I shall take their leader's head, and the rebels will scatter.	1																					
33	32		301								His Majesty	Good child, when you return in triumph, I will hire a renowned craftsman to forge a suit of armor worthy only of your brave soul!
