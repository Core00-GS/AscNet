7	7		301							1	Chrome	Must be the Corrupted self-exploding. But it doesn't seem to be doing much to the Kowloong walls.	2																					
8	8		301									The sounds of explosions are even reaching Strike Hawk's position. Tasked with defense, and not vanguard duty, the two can only stay put and be on standby.

12	12		301									The other squad dispatched here, Cerberus, arrives. Yet, only one member could be seen. She strolls unhurriedly toward the two Strike Hawk agents, as if the ongoing war does not concern her in the slightest.

15	15		301							1	Chrome	We've been waiting for you, Cerberus. What was the hold up?	2																					
16	16		301								Vera	Oh, Chrome, good "Kapitan"... Do I really have to answer that question?	1																					
17	17		301								Chrome	Redeployment orders are supposed to be executed without delay... Hold on a sec, where are your other two members? They're supposed to be here with you.	2																					
18	18		301									Vera's two teammates are nowhere to be seen, but Chrome's well-grounded observation does nothing to the devil-may-care smile on Vera's face.																						
19	19		301								Noctis	'Course we know about the "rules!" You got a problem with us not following 'em? Then why don't we duke it out here, eh, yes-man?																						
20	20		301								Chrome	Why are you on comms? Are you nearby?	2																					
21	21		301								Vera	You aren't even here. I'll do the duking if you really feel the need for it.	1																					
22	22		301								Noctis	Oh, hey, I read about you, big stick guy. Another dude's living inside ya, aye? And you smell positively deee-lectable. Interesting, makes me wanna...																						
23	23		301								Vera	Don't even. For the last time—Don't. Leave. Your. Post.	1																					
24	24		301								Noctis	Tch...																						
25	25		301								Chrome	What post? You have another mission?	2																					
26	26		301								Vera	Mh-hm, maybe yes, maybe no. Given the situation, having all three of us here is quite pointless anyway.	1

36	36		301									Following the warning from the comms, a swarm of jet-boosted Corrupted fly into the city. Some of them land where the two squads are.

42	42		301									Looking at these black Corrupted, Kamui is reminded of those Heteromers he and his team saw back in space. Chrome's nod confirms his guess.
