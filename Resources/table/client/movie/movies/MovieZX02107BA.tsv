4	4		301									Wide roads connect the main city and the six towering gray spires around it, still standing steadfast despite how long they have been abandoned.																						
5	5		301									After defeating the Corrupted, your boat enters the main city unscathed.																						
6	6		301									Years have passed, but the paint from the Golden Age has yet to fade. The densely packed highrises almost cover the sky, but their unlit windows no longer look like stars.																						
7	7		301									The closer you approach the city, the more intense the sense of dread.																						
8	8		301									The six spires around the city are like six towering tombstones, save for the lack of an epitaph.																						
9	9		301									Everywhere you look are marks left behind by humans, but the city feels lifeless.																						
10	10		301									Time has frozen in this place. History has stopped within these walls.

14	14		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You leap off the boat.																						
15	15		301									Vera walks ahead of you.																						
16	16		302								Are you... alright?	17																						
17	17		301									Vera has looked miserable since receiving the message from Hassen.																						
18	18		301									Hearing your question, she turns around.																						
19	19		201							1	500345	4																						
20	20		301							1	Vera	Huh? Are you seriously trying to take care of others' feelings when you can't even take care of yourself?	1																					
21	21		301								Vera	How about you stop wasting time talking to me and try to find the intel they want ASAP?	1																					
22	22		301								Vera	Hell... How are we supposed to find the precise thing they want in such a large city before it sinks?	1																					
23	23		302								21 and Noctis.	24																						
24	24		301								Vera	What about them?	1																					
25	25		302								You're worried about them.	26

27	27		301									Vera pauses.																						
28	28		301									She turns around again, her gaze piercing, her usual mockery absent.																						
29	29		302								The Chief Commander said he'd protect them.	30																						
30	30		201							1	500345	4																						
31	31		301							1	Vera	Do you really need someone to spell it all out to you? Don't you understand the subtext?	1																					
32	32		301								Vera	Nikola wasn't giving me a promise. He was giving me a warning.	1																					
33	33		301								Vera	He was warning me not to betray him.	1																					
34	34		301									With that, you suddenly grasp what she is talking about.																						
35	35		302								The Chief Commander is different from Kurono.	36																						
36	36		204							1	13																							
37	37		301								Vera	Do you honestly believe that?	1																					
38	38		301								Vera	Stop with your bullshit.	1																					
39	39		204							1	4																							
40	40		301								Vera	Lee is on your team. You must have heard him talking about Kurono and me.	1																					
41	41		301								Vera	I was one of Kurono's. I got transferred to the Task Force later.	1																					
42	42		301								Vera	Do you know how I ended up directly at Nikola's command?	1																					
43	43		301								Vera	Because he was one of Kurono's too.	1																					
44	44		301								Vera	It's not a secret. People from his generation know it full well, but most of those who know don't say a damn thing. It's not something worth celebrating, after all.	1																					
45	45		301								Vera	So, understand this—the Parliament is the same as Kurono fundamentally. Perhaps they've acted and believed different, but given everything you've been through, how virtuous do you think the Parliament can be?	1																					
46	46		301								Vera	The Parliament and Kurono are in a deadly game of chess right now, and we are their pawns and bets.	1																					
47	47		301								Vera	I suggest you focus on how to save yourself in this little dance they're doing first, instead of blindly trusting those in power.	1																					
48	48		301								Vera	The frame I'm using right now is called Garnet. It's designed to fight Constructs—to eliminate traitors. Unlike the Purifying Force, this frame isn't even registered in any system.	1																					
49	49		301								Vera	Sending it to me can only mean one thing.	1																					
50	50		204							1	5																							
51	51		301								Vera	—The Chief Commander believes our enemies this time are the Kurono Constructs.	1																					
52	52		301								Vera	Can you justify to yourself that the Kurono Constructs are not part of Babylonia? What's the difference between what we are doing now and those civil wars the humans had back then?	1																					
53	53		301								Vera	At the end of the day, they picked me for this mission simply because they didn't want to get Gray Raven's hands dirty.	1
