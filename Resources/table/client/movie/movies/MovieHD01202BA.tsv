7	7		301								Liv	Lucia and Lee didn't mean to harm you. They were just too anxious.	1																					
8	8		301								Liv	They won't do it anymore. You can come out now.	1

15	15		301			AniZhuanchangEnd		20				A few minutes ago—																						
16	16		301									With pale-blue flames coming out of the tailpipe, the tiger-head machine pounced at you. Lucia immediately took action.																						
17	17		301									The outstanding mobility of Plume allowed her to quickly get behind the machine. Her right hand slammed down, carefully avoiding the machine's blade "ears" and tailpipe flames.

23	23		301									The tiger head sensed the threat and quickly dived, barely avoiding Lucia's attack.																						
24	24		301									But it only ended up in Lee's trap, completely wrapped inside his blue tactical coat.																						
25	25		301									Lee had not used any harsh methods as he did not want to break the tiger head. It just dashed around inside the coat cluelessly, trying to find a way out.																						
26	26		301									Having no luck, it ended up using the blades to cut an opening again.																						
27	27		301									The Construct tactical coat weaved from special materials did not stand a chance. The tiger head soon broke free and hid under a chair.																						
28	28		201							1	500479																							
29	29		301			PanelActor1Shake				1	???	Rawrrr-meow!	1																					
30	30		301									It made a shaky, threatening sound.																						
31	31		301									Seeing the machine's stance, Lee and Lucia stopped taking further action.																						
32	32		201							1	1031001																							
33	33		301							1	Liv	I don't think it was going to attack Commandant.	1																					
34	34		301								Liv	Felines often pounce at the person they are close to. That's probably why it did so to Commandant.	1																					
35	35		201							1	500026																							
36	36		301							1	Lee	Even it wasn't hostile, if it hit Commandant with that amount of momentum, Commandant would have to spend tonight on a bed in Star of Life.	1																					
37	37		201							1	500479																							
38	38		301							1	???	Meooooow!	1																					
39	39		301									Seeing Lee and Lucia were still nearby, the tiger head made a shaky roar.																						
40	40		301									It then moved a little further into the shadow under the chair.																						
41	41		201							1	1031001

46	46		301							1	???	Meow... Roar...	1																					
47	47		301									Despite Liv's calming words, the tiger-head machine has not let its guard down. It is no longer trying to run away, but still reluctant to get out of the shadow.																						
48	48		201							1	1031001	1																						
49	49		301							1	Liv	I know you're the bravest. Come out now.	1

53	53		301									Liv slowly gets back on her feet, looking a little sad.																						
54	54		201							1	1031001	19				1																		
55	55		301							1	Liv	Sorry, I couldn't get it out.	1																					
56	56		302								I'll give it a try then.	57																						
57	57		204							1	1																							
58	58		301							1	Liv	Sure. Good luck, Commandant!	1																					
59	59		202							1					1																			
60	60		301									You slowly squat down to the same level as the machine and look it in the eyes.																						
61	61		201							1	500479																							
62	62		301							1	???	Meow?	1																					
63	63		301									The tiger head also moves slightly forward, trying to identify the new person.																						
64	64		201							1	1031001	1																						
65	65		301							1	Liv	Commandant, try to calm it down. Be gentle.	1																					
66	66		301									Liv lowers her voice behind you, trying not to alert the tiger head.																						
67	67		302								Good kitty. Come here...	68	Want a treat? I've got some goodies for you!	70																				
68	68		301								Liv	That's it.	1

71	71		301							1	Lucia	Huh? Will tigers like this treat?	1																					
72	72		202							1					1																			
73	73		301									It hesitates a bit, then slowly flies out from under the chair.																						
74	74		201							1	500479																							
75	75		301			PanelActor1Shake				1	???	Meooooow!	1																					
76	76		301									But soon makes another sharp noise after seeing Lucia and Lee standing nearby.																						
77	77		301									When it realizes they have not taken any further actions, it stops "stepping" back.																						
78	78		301								???	Meow?	1																					
79	79		301									The tiger head moves toward you with great caution, frequently turning away to watch Lucia and Lee's actions.																						
80	80		301									When it finally gets into a safe distance, it immediately leaps into your arms.																						
81	81		301								???	Me-ow...	1																					
82	82		301									The machine gladly rubs against your chest. Thankfully, the jet engine behind its head is not activated this time.																						
83	83		201							1	1031001	1																						
84	84		301							1	Liv	Great. It likes Commandant.	1																					
85	85		201							1	500166																							
86	86		301							1	Lucia	But why did Nanami send it here anyway?	1																					
87	87		201							1	500026																							
88	88		301							1	Lee	I have checked the package. There was no message left.	1																					
89	89		202							1					1																			
90	90		301									You pick up the machine to inspect. It calmly allows your hands to move around its body.																						
91	91		201							1	500479																							
92	92		301							1	???	Meow... Meow...	1																					
93	93		301									Is it enjoying this?																						
94	94		301									When you look right into its red eyes—																						
95	95		401							2	897																							
96	96		301								Nanami's Voice	Beep—Iris recognition passed... What other checks are there? Forget about them. Too much hassle!																						
97	97		301								Nanami's Voice	Identity confirmed: Gray Raven Commandant 【kuroname】.																						
98	98		301									As a red light scans through your pupils, you hear Nanami's voice from the machine.

101	101		301							1	Nanami	It's been a long time, Commandant!	1																					
102	102		301									You see Nanami's hologram in the air.																						
103	103		301								Nanami	Surprise! The gift didn't come from the Science Council. It's me, Nanami!	1																					
104	104		302								...	105	It's quite surprising in a way.	105																				
105	105		301									The hologram is not real-time, but a pre-recorded video.																						
106	106		301									So Nanami has not responded to the strange look you give her. Her speech continues.																						
107	107		301							1	Nanami	Now, allow me to introduce my greatest work. Ta-da! Behold, Tiger!	1

114	114		204							1																								
115	115		301								Nanami	You must have already found out that Tiger is a combat booster similar to CUBs.	1																					
116	116		301								Nanami	But it can't transform yet, so don't use it for combat.	1																					
117	117		204							1	1																							
118	118		301								Nanami	If there is a chance, I'd like to make you a more powerful "Super Tiger"!	1																					
119	119		301								Nanami	Of course, Tiger is more than just a cat. I put a lot of time and energy into it.	1																					
120	120		301								Nanami	I have prepared more gifts inside its head. There are many things I'd like to share with you all.	1																					
121	121		301								Nanami	But for my own enjoyment... Oops, no, to make Commandant cherish the upcoming festival more, I have also set up some trials related to it.	1																					
122	122		301								Nanami	Of course there will be hints! Go check them out with others, Commandant!	1

159	159		301								Liv	It feels like we are all unwrapping the gift together.	1																					
160	160		301								Lee	So, are we connecting?	3																					
161	161		301									After confirming there is still some time before 23:00—
