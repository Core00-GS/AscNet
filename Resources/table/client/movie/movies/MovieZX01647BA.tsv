9	9		301							1	Lee	"Murray," or whatever you want to call yourself... Maybe you thought you did a good job mimicking him, but you could not fool me.	2																					
10	10		301								"Murray"	L-Lee, what are you talking about?! I'm your brotherâ€”don't you recognize me?	1																					
11	11		301								Lee	Then explain to me why I couldn't get past the signal blockade when I tried to reach Babylonia since we've gotten Huaxu's key, when you, who are apparently in Babylonia, can suddenly contact us?	2																					
12	12		301								"Murray"	It's... probably...	1																					
13	13		301								Lee	The first time I felt suspicious was when I mentioned the graviton detector. If you were him, you would've known it's impossible to send a response here.	2																					
14	14		301								Lee	Plus, we've analyzed the environmental noises in your call, and you weren't in Babylonia at all.	2																					
15	15		302								Lamia, I assume.	16

21	21		301								Lamia	Apart from the human, this should be my first time meeting the Graven Ravens, right?	1																					
22	22		302								What do you want?	23																						
23	23		301								Lamia	Just trying to get you out of here safe and sound with the pod.	1

29	27		301							1	Lamia	Hehe... Pretty clever, aren't you, "brother"?	1																					
30	28		301									You can see Lee clenching his jaw. If this were not a call, Lamia would have been shot multiple times already.																						
31	29		301								Lamia	How about a deal, Commandant? Give me Huaxu's key, and I'll show you the way to the big guy there...	1																					
32	30		302								What do you want with the key?	31																						
33	31		301								Lamia	That you don't have to know... I'm not the one in a hurry here...	1																					
34	32		301									As if responding to Lamia's words, the roar from the Polyphage echos again.

39	36		201							1	500026																							
40	37		301							1	Lee	Not a good idea to hand it in now. We can't guarantee that she'll keep her words.	1																					
41	38		201							1	500166																							
42	39		301							1	Lucia	Is it possible to find her?	1

45	42		301							1	Liv	But where is she?	1																					
46	43		301								Lee	Given how strong the signal blockade is here and how well she knows our actions, I'm guessing she's just nearby.	2																					
47	44		301								Lee	We can use the environmental sounds we analyzed earlier to deduce where she is in this chasm.	2																					
48	45		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	Understood. Leave it to me!	1
