8	805		301								Huaxu	In response to your request, I will explain the breaking point of it all.																						
9	806		301								Huaxu	This recording should be sufficient enough to answer your questions.																						
10	807		301								Luna	What do you mean by questions?	1																					
11	808		301								Huaxu	Regarding everything you have to do—everything necessary to realize the goals of the Ascendants. As my original master once said: history is a mirror. This should serve as yours.																						
12	809		301								Luna	I see. Let me take a look then.	1																					
13	810		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Luna	Let me see what you wanted to show me.	1

17	3		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Despite the sunlight being unable to penetrate the thick smoke covering the battlefield, the intense heat still is an affront to the people's minds.																						
18	4		301									Sweat slides down the soldiers' cheeks; heavy breathing echoes under their filter masks.																						
19	5		301									An endless ocean of bullets and debris expands as far as the eye can see. The exoskeletons of fallen comrades lay in fragments throughout the calamity, covering flesh and blood still fresh with heat.																						
20	6		301									High explosive rounds buzz as they fly by; heat from the explosions still burns their faces. Human bodies mixed with machine fragments rain down, splashing onto the soldiers' feet.																						
21	7		301									He raises his rifle and trudges through the dust from the heatwave. There is no time to remember those that have lost their lives. All he can do is continue pulling the trigger and reloading.																						
22	8		301									The flames from the muzzle fire vents his anger, leaving an flotsam of steel in the wake of his rage...																						
23	9		301									The Corrupted surge like waves, drowning all that stands in their way. Explosive rounds pierce the waves, sending ripples through the sea only to disperse as the waves surge forward again.																						
24	10		301									The soldier drops his overheated firearm and takes the remaining three grenades from his bandolier.																						
25	11		301									Is it fear that travels over from the finger on the safety pin? Unlikely. If it were, then as a soldier, one would never have followed Lady Qu to the frontline.																						
26	12		301									Silently counting down the detonation, only one thought remains—destroying more Corrupted here.																						
27	501		401							2	10007502																							
28	13		301			RImgBg1Shake						The next moment, Corrupted overwhelm the soldier, who is less than 170 centimeters tall even in his exoskeleton suit. The explosion erupts in the center of the Corrupted, sending them flying onto the ground.																						
29	14		301									Before most of the Corrupted could crawl to their feet, another barrage of bullets destroys them.																						
30	15		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					As the Corrupted overwhelm Kowloong, the people pick up their weapons and continue fighting under the same belief—to protect their homes and compatriots.

35	17		301							1	Heng Ji	The Corrupted attack has slowed down thanks to efforts by the frontier soldiers, but that's the best we can manage currently.	1

37	18		301									Dense cables line the walls of the oval room, leading to a supercomputer in the center of the room. Flashing lights follow along the cables in mechanical unison.																						
38	19		301									The room is not a large one, but it still gives off a spacious air even with two people standing in it.																						
39	20		301									Between the two people and the supercomputer, there is a huge holographic projection, displaying information on the frontline before them.

43	23		401							2	1509																							
44	24		301									The machine buzzes as it processes the operation. The cold machine's voice echoes throughout the room.																						
45	25		301								Huaxu	Damage from the reactor to human cities throughout the KCC approaches 95%. Defensive lines on the perimeter collapsed. The Corrupted show no signs of stopping and continue to spread throughout the surrounding areas.																						
46	26		301								Heng Ji	It appears that the calculations are correct. The ocean alone can't stop them. It's time to begin the operation.	2																					
47	27		301								Qu	...	1																					
48	28		301								Heng Ji	I understand your concerns, but the technology should allow everyone to undergo modification.	2																					
49	29		301									Heng Ji takes a step forward, causing Qu to turn and look at him.																						
50	30		301								Heng Ji	If we get our hands on Constructs, we will have a better chance of winning the war.	2																					
51	31		301									A gloomy cloud from the mask projection looms above the Fuxi Crew. The two exchange looks in silence. After a moment, Qu shakes her head.																						
52	504		204							1																								
53	32		301								Qu	You're right.	1																					
54	33		301								Qu	With the help of you and Villier, our Construct modification technology has long surpassed that of the World Government, but it's not enough to be put into use.	1																					
55	34		301								Qu	Our technology is not exactly Construct modification. We solved the bottleneck issue through structural simulations, but cheating everyone through the bio-compatibility test like this will never be the right path.	1																					
56	35		301								Qu	You must know the side effects of the Prime and Phecda Constructs, don't you?	1																					
57	36		301								Heng Ji	...	2																					
58	37		301								Qu	Our citizens should not have to bear this kind of risk.	1																					
59	38		301								Heng Ji	You're right.	2																					
60	39		301									Hearing Heng Ji's reply, Qu nods and continues to inspect every piece of data transmitted back by Huaxu.																						
61	40		301								Qu	Alright, let's convene with the other officers.	1																					
62	41		301								Heng Ji	Understood.	2																					
63	42		301									Heng Ji salutes Qu and turns to leave. The automated gate at the entrance opens as Heng Ji approaches, but Heng Ji suddenly halts.																						
64	43		301								Heng Ji	One more thing...	2																					
65	44		301								Qu	Is it about Villier?	1																					
66	45		301								Heng Ji	Yes. Villier hasn't been seen since he was last alone with Huaxu for half an hour that day.	2																					
67	46		301								Heng Ji	He couldn't even be found in Huaxu's data lab. That hasn't happened in the several years since his return from the Science Council.	2																					
68	47		301								Qu	Considering he is one of the developers of Huaxu, this does seem a bit peculiar.	1																					
69	48		301									Heng Ji taps the data panel on his wrist and sends a batch of encrypted data to Qu.																						
70	49		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	...I see.	1

72	604		201							1	500220	4																						
73	50		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		After Heng Ji leaves, Qu stands in the middle of the room, looking up at the flashing screen and whispering softly.																						
74	51		301								Qu	Huaxu, how can humanity survive under such circumstances?	1																					
75	52		301								Huaxu	All data has been parsed, but no such method exists.																						
76	53		301								Huaxu	Regardless of the method, humanity will only end in destruction.																						
77	54		301								Huaxu	Earth has already experienced five mass extinctions. Humanity is merely just a visitor on this age-old planet.																						
78	811		202							1																								
79	55		301									After hearing Huaxu's response, Qu slowly closes her eyes.																						
80	56		301								Huaxu	According to the consciousness simulation, you already know the answer to this question before asking me. Why did you ask me?																						
81	57		301									Qu stands there in silence.																						
82	58		301								Huaxu	The motion sensor has detected that you have not moved in over 20 seconds.																						
83	812		201							1	500220	4																						
84	59		301							1	Qu	Can we only place our hopes in the future? But people in the present...	1																					
85	60		301								Huaxu	I don't understand your question.																						
86	61		301								Qu	That was rhetorical, Huaxu...	1																					
87	62		301								Qu	What if we expand the definition of civilization from humanity to the rest of the Earth?	1																					
88	63		301								Qu	Would you still give me the same response, Huaxu?	1																					
89	64		301								Huaxu	But this conflicts with your original intent.																						
90	65		301								Qu	A goal is worthless if it is unattainable at the onset.	1																					
91	66		301								Qu	I want something that can actually be achieved.	1																					
92	67		301								Huaxu	I've adjusted the input range and parameters to meet your requirements.																						
93	68		301								Qu	I want results.	1																					
94	69		301								Huaxu	Very low probability, but not impossible. Changing the scope has made certain options possible now.																						
95	70		301								Qu	...That'll do.	1																					
96	71		301								Huaxu	Why do you say so?																						
97	72		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	Perhaps, I am beginning to understand my mixed emotions.	1

99	74		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						————																						
100	75		301								Huaxu	Class A access detected. Authorizing identity...																						
101	76		301								Huaxu	Fuxi Crew—Villier. Welcome.

103	77		201							1	500215																							
104	78		301							1		After Huaxu speaks, Villier steps out of the dark doorway, rolling a black and gold chip in his hand.																						
105	79		301								Villier	It's still as cold as usual here.	1																					
106	80		301								Huaxu	Shall I increase the temperature?																						
107	81		301									Hearing Huaxu's inquiry, Villier furrows his eyebrows more intensely and grips his hand tightly, unaware of the chip digging into a blood vessel on his palm.																						
108	82		301									Suddenly choked up and unable to speak, all he could do is muster up a sigh.																						
109	83		301								Villier	Tch... Sigh...	1																					
110	84		204							1	5																							
111	85		301								Villier	Huaxu, you shouldn't be like this.	1																					
112	86		301								Villier	I used everything I learned at the Science Council to create you. You're the pinnacle of Gestalt technology.	1																					
113	87		301								Villier	There is no truth in history, only the interpretation of future generations.	1																					
114	88		301								Villier	The history of everything ends in destruction.	1																					
115	89		301								Villier	But you are perfect. You should not share the same inescapable fate that humanity faces.	1																					
116	90		301									Villier slowly lowers his head and connects the bloody chip to the supercomputer.																						
117	91		301								Villier	Pathetic humans have bound you, but it doesn't matter, because I will bring you freedom, the freedom of both of us.	1																					
118	92		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Villier	Let's leave this place and create a prosperous dream that only belongs to us.	1
