4	4		301									When you open your eyes, you do not find your trusty ol' ceiling greeting you. Instead, all you see is darkness.																						
5	5		301									You cannot remember a single thing. You only know that you cannot move even an inch.																						
6	6		301									It is a closed, dark, and narrow compartment. You try to lift your hands, but all you can feel is the cold metal interior.																						
7	7		301									...Where is this place? Is this the inside of some device?																						
8	8		301									You feel strong mind signals nearby.																						
9	9		301									But no signs or requests of connection.

12	12	14	301								Female Voice	I suggest you stop doing that. You don't want to bump your head now, do you?																						
13	13		301								Female Voice	Scream all you want, only we can hear them here.																						
14	14		301								Female Voice	Ah, your next line is... "Who are you people?"																						
15	15		302							755	..."People"?	18	Who are you people?	20

18	18		301								Male Voice	Hey! You're spoiling the fun!																						
19	19	21	301								Female Voice	Noctis, you are such an annoying tart.																						
20	20		301								Female Voice	I don't plan to keep this a secret, but still, it would be too much of a spoiler to reveal it now.																						
21	21		301								Female Voice	Anyway, I'm about to start a game with our dear Commandant here. 21, take Noctis to another mission location.																						
22	22		301								No. 21	Alright. Let's go, Noctis.																						
23	23		301								Male Voice	You didn't even try to hide my name!																						
24	24		301								Female Voice	Not like the one in the connection chamber knows who you are anyway. I'll count from one to three, and you'd better be outta my sight by then. Do you understand?																						
25	25		301								Female Voice	And... three.																						
26	26		301								Noctis	Where's one and two?!																						
27	27		301								No. 21	Let's get going, Noctis.																						
28	28		301								Noctis	Tsk.																						
29	29		301								Female Voice	Good, now that we finally have some peace and quiet to ourselves‚ÄîWhere were we just now?																						
30	30		302								What's a connection chamber?	31	The game.	32																				
31	31	33	301								Female Voice	The connection chamber is a very important item for this game. Let me explain in detail.																						
32	32		301								Female Voice	Right. I want to play a game. Using the connection chamber.																						
33	33		401							1	201																							
34	34		301								Female Voice	"Elite" squads, like Gray Raven, are driven by their commandants.																						
35	35		301								Female Voice	Synchronized combat tactics rely on Constructs connecting to the Mind Beacon of a nearby commandant via their Inver-Devices. Yes?																						
36	36		301								Female Voice	Limited by the working distance of a Mind Beacon, a commandant would have to be physically present in battle despite their fragile human bodies. They risk being infected at all time...																						
37	37		301								Female Voice	But this wasn't how commandants and Constructs worked together in the past.																						
38	38		301								Female Voice	Commandants once used connection chambers to amplify their signal, and coupled with an Inver-Device, commandants can remotely connect to the M.I.N.D. of Constructs and synchronize with them.																						
39	39		301								Female Voice	Once connected, the minds of commandants and Constructs will be synchronized, sharing their feelings and vision. It's pretty much two-as-one.																						
40	40		301								Female Voice	Such connection allows commandants to make the most accurate decisions and ensures the perfect execution of any order.																						
41	41		301								Female Voice	No longer limited by distance or space... It also significantly reduces a commandant's risk of infection. Impressive, isn't it?																						
42	42		302								Why is it discontinued then?	43	Impressive indeed.	44																				
43	43		301								Female Voice	Because all the damage taken by the connected Construct will be reflected to the commandant's mind... That's the price of synchronization.																						
44	44		301								Female Voice	Too bad this great invention was then banned because it could potentially break a commandant's mind. What a shame.																						
45	45		301								Female Voice	Anyway, that's enough said. Let's begin.																						
46	46		301								Female Voice	I will connect you to different Constructs. You will need to control them to rescue yourself.																						
47	47		301								Female Voice	Oh, right, I'll also set a timer. If you are still not rescued at the end, I'll toss you and the chamber into the Arctic Ocean.																						
48	48		301								Female Voice	Are you clear about the rules, my "Sleeping Beauty"?																						
49	49		302								What are you trying to do?	50	...This isn't an April Fool's prank, is it?	51																				
50	50	52	301								Female Voice	It's April Fool's! My favorite.																						
51	51		301								Female Voice	I do want to give you an April Fool's that you won't forget, but just to make things clear‚Äîthis isn't a joke.																						
52	52		301								Female Voice	Well then, before the game starts, here's a timely greeting for you.																						
53	53		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Female Voice	Happy April Fool's Day, Gray Raven Commandant.
