8	8		301								Rohacchi	I. Think. Worth. Trying.	3

19	19		301									Rohacchi hops into the chamber and brushes the dust off the terminal.																						
20	20		301								Rohacchi	Martin. Help.																						
21	21		202							2					1																			
22	22		301									Hearing Rohacchi, Martin also enters the chamber and joins in.																						
23	23		301									One end of a cable is thrown out of the chamber shortly.

25	25		301							1	Nanami	?	1																					
26	26		301								Martin	Try connecting to it.																						
27	27		301								Rohacchi	Need. Test. To. See. If. Work.																						
28	28		301									Nanami picks up the cable and is about to connect it to her nape port.																						
29	29		301								Martin	...Are you not concerned in the slightest?

31	31		301								Nanami	Huh? You're Nanami's friends! Why do I have to be concerned?	1

36	35		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Space‚Äîthe thought fluttered into Nanami's mind.																						
37	36		301									Looking downward, she sees a certain place in Babylonia.																						
38	37		301								Nanami	I'm...	1

40	39		201							2	500264		-400																					
41	40		301							1	???	This is a virtual space weaved from the internal computational structure of the matrix.	2																					
42	41		204							1	1																							
43	42		301								Nanami	Huh? Oh, you're... You look different again...	1																					
44	43		301								???	"My" external form does not matter.	2																					
45	44		301								Nanami	Only the information matters... That's what you've always been saying.	1																					
46	45		301								???	The shell does not matter. "I" am the other Will, distinct from you, but we represent the same thing.	2																					
47	46		301								Nanami	Yeah, I got the message. So what are you trying to tell me?	1																					
48	47		301								???	"I" am not trying to "tell" you something. Merely that there is information useful for the individual known as Nanami.	2																					
49	48		301								???	The individual Nanami can no longer simply be categorized as a human, a machine, a Construct, a Corrupted, or even an in-between.	2																					
50	49		301								???	The other Will wishes that the individual Nanami would realize the path that she should take.	2																					
51	50		204							1																								
52	51		301								Nanami	...	1																					
53	52		301								???	"I" wish to know why the individual Nanami doubts.	2																					
54	53		301								Nanami	...Do you know about Cardman Rider?	1																					
55	54		301								???	...Relevant information acquired. Cardman Rider is a media franchise consisting of books, visual programs, and toys that was popular in the Golden Age.	2																					
56	55		301								Nanami	...Guess you don't.	1																					
57	56		301								???	"I" do not understand what you mean.	2																					
58	57		204							1	1																							
59	58		301								Nanami	Okay. Cardman Rider is like, all about... ha‚Äîhmph‚Äîschween then transforming and going pew pew and boom fighting enemies and then a TAAA to finish the enemies and then turning around and‚Äî	1																					
60	59		301								Nanami	Cardman Rider! Never! Looks at! Explosions! Haiya!	1																					
61	60		301									Posing along as she explains, Nanami excitedly demonstrates the various transform sequences and signature moves of different Cardman Riders.																						
62	61		301								Nanami	...That's all stuff that humans came up with.	1																					
63	62		301								Nanami	Do they really deserve to be washed out?	1																					
64	63		301								???	Huaxu has already completed the simulation for how human civilization ends. The other Will has also done so.	2																					
65	64		301								???	The result deviation is less than 0.001 percentage points.	2																					
66	65		301								Nanami	That's not what I meant‚ÄîI'm not talking about the simulations or whatnot. You know Nanami is not the sharpest tool in the shed...	1																					
67	66		301								Nanami	But I really, really, REALLY like the stuff that humans make.	1																					
68	67		301								Nanami	Things like George D. Toro's Oceanic Rim, there are like, six giant humanoid robots that are as tall as mountains in it!	1																					
69	68		301								Nanami	And it's not just Cardman Riders, humans made a lot more other stuff too!	1																					
70	69		301								Nanami	Like a giant metal fist that flies at supersonic speed! Or the undefeated‚ÄîSekiha Tenkyo Punch!	1																					
71	70		301								Nanami	Even if what you said turns out to be true, even if humanity is destined to end...	1																					
72	71		301								Nanami	I don't think their creations, and how they make them should be forgotten by us.	1																					
73	72		301								???	Is this why the individual Nanami is operating sub-optimally?	2																					
74	73		301									An almost audible silence fills the air, as if who Nanami has been talking to is struck with confusion.																						
75	74		301								???	The only solution to evolution has been found, but the individual Nanami is still obsessed over meaningless items.	2																					
76	75		301								Nanami	Yeah yeah, I know. I'll do what you say.	1																					
77	76		301								Nanami	But I still wanna see if humans can make more of them wapows and boombooms, you know!	1																					
78	77		301								Nanami	So... I'd still like to give them a chance, just a teeny little one!	1																					
79	78		301								???	Incomprehensible. Even if they could, they will go extinct at the same rate.	2																					
80	79		301								Nanami	Even if you can't understand, Nanami will still do so.	1																					
81	80		301								Nanami	Because Nanami is different from you all! Not like you or Huaxu, or those Ascendant baddies.	1																					
82	81		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Nanami	Nanami... loves humans.	1
