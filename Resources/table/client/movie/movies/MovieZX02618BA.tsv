5	5		301									She is facing a dark, void space. No planets or stars can be detected nearby, nor is she able to receive signals of any frequency. Even the temperature in this area is closer to the absolute zero.																						
6	6		301									She just curls up in the vacuum, letting the abyss consume her.																						
7	7		301									Lights of future die in the darkness, but more stars appear from this "infinite" space.																						
8	8		301									When the light shines upon Nanami, everything seems to move in slow motion.																						
9	9		301									She remembers a human who once told her that humans could enter the "mind palace" during deep thinking, in which they could think at an incredibly fast speed that also made time flow slower to them.																						
10	10		301									Nanami, however, never thought about lives in the universe or complicated scientific theories. Her mechanically-made chip and cords repeat one and only one question—"Why?"

27	27		301									—It overwhelms the high-speed data flow in her mind like a storm, capturing every piece of memory whether they are real or only exist in the program's simulation.																						
28	28		301									Nanami looks at the scenes in her memory and feels deeply confused but curious.																						
29	29		301									Nanami's curiosity, however, is nothing like what humankind feels when seeing something they've never seen—rather, she is feeling curious about how she came into being.																						
30	30		301									Why?																						
31	31		301									How did the machines manage to awaken when they were man-made?																						
32	32		301									And for what?																						
33	33		301									In different futures, Nanami comes across mechanoids like herself—who are fond of humans and pursue human consciousness. And there are those like Gabriel—who believe power is everything—and those from "Gear" who are set on fighting humans. They don't fight to live, but to find the meaning of war.																						
34	34		301									What's the point of war anyway?																						
35	35		301									Why did Punishing appear? Why would it fall upon the earth? What was controlling and manipulating Punishing? What did they want?																						
36	36		301									Why is humankind so stubborn about Earth, anyway? Is it because they love it? But why? What is love, anyway?																						
37	37		301									And what is Nanami seeking after all? To protect the things she loves, so they don't disappear?																						
38	38		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Was it designed by Nanami's creator, who added "love" to her program logic... Or something else?

40	40		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Nanami had a long dream during endless, prolonged thinking.																						
41	41		301									In the dream, she seems to have turned into a giant, pale-gray wolf running on the ancient wilderness, chased by a gray forest that strangled her claws with thorns.																						
42	42		301									She struggles, growls, but could not do anything.

47	47		301									The forest then transforms into a cold, deep sea. Nanami changes into a fish to escape the thorns, but drifts away in the waves.																						
48	48		301									The tide of the sea lurked and moved like a silent beast with sharp spikes on its back, awaiting its prey but also breeding primitive lives.

53	53		301									The tide recedes. Nanami pushes herself up on the sand and finds herself with human-like limbs.

58	58		301									As she stumbles forward, buildings rise under her feet. Giant ships sail from the ocean in distance. She sees everything underneath in a miniature scale. Humans gather in cities, civilizations begin to grow. Skyscrapers pierce through the ground. The honking of cars and howling wind make her drowsy.

63	63		301									The steel buildings continue to rise and wrap her inside. She sees a large, complicated computer standing in front. She looks around, this place feels so familiar but strange.																						
64	64		301									A person in white walks around Nanami, their eyes shining and their hands moving as they speak like a commandant. Nanami could almost see a promising future in those eyes.																						
65	65		301									She grabs the finger of that human.																						
66	66		301									The human pats her forehead. It is the first time she feels the warmth of a human since she was born as a mechanoid.																						
67	67		301								Human	...Nanami, experience everything of mankind, then make your own choice.																						
68	68		301								Nanami	Nanami does not understand. What does that mean?																						
69	69		301									She hears her answer that overlaps with her own, naive voice long ago.																						
70	70		301								Nanami	Are you the human who created Nanami? Can you tell me why you made me...?																						
71	71		301									Before she hears an answer, she is thrown into another scene.
