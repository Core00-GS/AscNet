11	11		301								Noctis	Gosh, why am I feeling cold... When will this fog dissipate?!	3																					
12	12		301									Moist vapor scatters in the air, forming water droplets on the artificial skins of the Constructs. Their footsteps draw a line amidst the fog, and they shiver as the vapor draws on their exposed skin like a cold finger.																						
13	13		301								Vera	...It's just your regular fog. Visibility is low, sure, but the Punishing Virus concentration is still normal, so calm down and keep moving.	1

22	22		301									As the fire and smoke dissipate, the rest of you find out what No. 21 was shooting. It is a tall tree, withered and dry, and, with the laser strike, it now has a big, burnt hole in the center, its edges sizzling.																						
23	23		301								Vera	What's wrong?!	1																					
24	24		301								No. 21	...I sensed eyes.	2																					
25	25		301								Noctis	Don't scare me! I can't do surprises!	3

27	27		301									No. 21 thinks for a moment before shaking her head.

39	39		202							1					1																			
40	40		301									No. 21 does not argue. Still standing before the tree, she holds her hand up and gently touches the dark, burnt parts.																						
41	41		301									Withdrawing her hand, she finds her sleeve covered in blood-like marks.																						
42	42		201							1	500328	3																						
43	43		301							1	No. 21	...	1																					
44	44		202							1					1																			
45	45		301									She puts her sleeve to her nose and sniffs, noticing the smell of rust. It is not blood but the scent of rusty metal in a humid environment.																						
46	46		301									Looking down, she finds a rotting doll lying in the bushes next to the tree.																						
47	47		301									Shaped like a stuffed animal, it is too dirty to tell its original color, save for the bright red of its cracked lips. The two stiff, sad eyeballs, poorly sewn, are staring straight at No. 21 like melted glass orbs.																						
48	48		301								Noctis	Hey, come on!																						
49	49		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Noctis calls to her from afar. Shaking her head, No. 21 forgets about that gaze hiding in the fog.

53	53		301									Solemn and gloomy, the European-styled buildings, as well as the sparse scenery, the deserted walls, and the dying trees covered in white, all display sickly tiredness.																						
54	54		201							1	500336	4																						
55	55		301							1	Noctis	This fog is finally leaving...	1

57	57		202							1					1																			
58	58		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					That is when you realize No. 21 is not by your side. You all turn around and find her crouching at the cross-section you just passed, staring at a shop window by the road.

62	61		301									You can still vaguely identify their finely sculpted faces, silent evidence of their past glory.																						
63	63		301									But now...

65	62		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cg2001_2.jpg

67	65		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cg2001_1.jpg																								
68	66		301								No. 21	...																						
69	67		301									No. 21's expression reminds you of a time when two young girls also stopped for a doll mid-mission.																						
70	68		302								Do you want it?	69																						
71	69		301									She looks at you, expressionless, before reaching out her hand. Her arm goes through the glass window, shattering it, and she retrieves the doll.																						
72	70		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				...	71

75	72		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						No. 21 takes off the doll's head with a "snap," and the broken wires spark at its neck. With that, the doll's eyelids close, unable to stay up.																						
76	73		301									Casually, she holds up the doll's head toward you, and you find the sight fairly terrifying.

84	80		301								No. 21	I saw it in the shop window at the last cross-section.	1																					
85	81		302								Could it be that there's one in every shop window?	82																						
86	82		301								No. 21	I didn't sense "wrong." It was following me.	1

90	86		401							2	1509																							
91	87		301									Vera takes the head from No. 21's hand and taps her receptor, and her eyes project a ray of light, scanning the head before displaying a bright green "CLEAR".																						
92	88		301								Vera	Tsk.	2																					
93	89		301									Grasping the doll's artificial hair with two fingers, Vera flings the head to the side.																						
94	90		301								Vera	I trust your instinct, 21, but now's not the time to disrupt the operation by these unproved, trivial hunches.	2																					
95	91		204							1	3																							
96	92		301								No. 21	...Okay. I understand.	1																					
97	93		301									No. 21 says so as she looks down at her hands before shaking her head again.																						
98	94		301								No. 21	I don't understand.	1																					
99	95		301								Vera	What don't you understand, now?	2																					
100	96		301								No. 21	My hand is itchy.	1																					
101	97		202							1	2				1																			
102	98		301									She raises her hands high, and her big, puffy sleeves slide down and cover her head, making her look slightly foolish. Still, she points her hands toward Vera, and Noctis also walks up and looks.																						
103	99		301									But there is nothing on them except some dust she has picked up accidentally.

113	109		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After that brief interlude, you all travel for another short while, and you start noticing remains of strangely-built mechanoids on the sides of the road, long immobilized.																						
114	110		201							2	500328																							
115	111		301							1	No. 21	This...	2																					
116	112		301									No. 21 crouches before a damaged mechanoid. Most of its body is destroyed, leaving behind half a fractured orb. Inside the crack are wires and blades, as a few broken mechanical tentacles extend from within.																						
117	113		201							1	500168		600																					
118	114		201							3	500336	4	-600																					
119	115		301							1	Noctis	What the hell is that...	3																					
120	116		301									Noctis, walking to No. 21's side, bends down and touches the remaining half of a tentacle.																						
121	117		301									The mechanoid seems to detect Noctis touching it, shaking violently as the half-tentacle stands from its core with a long needle at its end, glistening chillingly under the sun.																						
122	118		302								Watch out!	119																						
123	119		301									Reacting quickly, Noctis catches the needle with two of his fingers and snaps it.																						
124	120		301								Noctis	What the hell is that?!	3																					
125	121		301								Vera	Let me see.	1																					
126	122		301									Vera takes the needle from him, sniffing it, even tasting it with her tongue.																						
127	123		301								Vera	Drugs, for humans, probably expired for centuries. Can't mistake the smell.	1																					
128	124		302								...Is this how Cerberus operate?	125																						
129	125		301								Vera	What do you want? Pack it up in a nice package and ship it to Asimov for analysis? Or are there other insights you want to share, Commandant?	1																					
130	126		302								Can I take a look at the whole thing?	127																						
131	127		202							1	2	3			1																			
132	128		301									Vera picks up the damaged mechanoid and spins it around.																						
133	129		301									Rusty as it is, you can still vaguely recognize the few pointed objects inside its mutilated frame. The widest crack on its body is lined with rugged edges, seemingly broken apart by a blunt object intentionally.																						
134	130		301									Its base is completely busted. You surmise that it would have been connected with "legs" that support the orb's body based on the configuration of its couplings.																						
135	131		301									—This kind of analysis is usually done by Lee, you think. But after so many missions together, you have picked up a thing or two about the construction of machines.																						
136	132		302								It kind of looks like 21's orb, no?	133																						
137	133		201							1	500168		600																					
138	134		201							2	500328

140	136		301							1	Vera	Co-Bot?	1																					
141	137		301								No. 21	It's "Buddy".	2																					
142	138		302								It got a name, huh?	139	Right.	139																				
143	139		301								Noctis	They don't look alike except for both being... round.	3																					
144	140		302								(Point out the missing parts at the base and its back)	141																						
145	141		301								Vera	Now that you point it out... I do see the resemblance.	1																					
146	142		301									Those pointed objects are mostly pincers and scalpels, as well as hemostats and parts of the injection device Vera discovered. This mechanoid was a Medic Bot responsible for emergency human surgeries.																						
147	143		302								It's a mechanoid used for medical purposes.	144																						
148	144		301								Vera	I recall something like that during the late Golden Age—portable Medic Bots that were quite popular back then but more or less obsolete now. You won't find them on Babylonia anymore.	1																					
149	145		204							2	4																							
150	146		301								No. 21	...	2																					
151	147		302								21... what's wrong?	148																						
152	148		301									Her unusual quietness has caught your attention. Still, she only frowns and shakes her head, not answering you.																						
153	149		301								Noctis	We know that now, great. Then what?	3																					
154	150		302								These mechanoids... seem to be destroyed deliberately.	151																						
155	151		301									As you observe the members of Cerberus, you find No. 21 to be especially sensitive to anomalies.																						
156	152		301									She has been acting strange since entering the town. You cannot tell if it is her affecting your subconscious or if it is your experience in battles warning you... you know that this town is more than meets the eyes.																						
157	153		301									"Those people" would not have sent you if this is just a normal small town.																						
158	154		301								Vera	Noctis, check the map.	1																					
159	155		301								Noctis	Sure. Um, hold on... where are we now? Here?	3																					
160	156		301								Vera	21, cross-reference the coordinates of the objective with that map.	1																					
161	157		204							2																								
162	158		301								No. 21	Copy.	2																					
163	159		301									No. 21 opens the holo-map on her terminal, displaying the location of Cerberus, not far away from the blinking red light that denotes their destination, which is—																						
164	160		301									Vera's finger glides right along their route on the brittle paper map until she stops on a single word.

169	165		301									Her legs hanging on a branch of the tree, No. 21's head pops out from the leaves, upside down, with a few leaves sticking on her face.																						
170	166		201							1	500168																							
171	167		301							1	Vera	Climbing up there is entirely unnecessary. What have you been teaching her, Noctis?	1																					
172	168		301								Noctis	Hey, don't pigeonhole me!																						
173	169		301								Vera	Say that again when you climb back down!	1																					
174	170		301									The beefy redhead crouches on another branch, sniffing excitedly, his eyes glittering like a deadly predator noticing its prey.																						
175	171		301								Noctis	We're here.																						
176	172		202							1					1																			
177	173		301									Your vision travels through the small area before you to a white building hidden in the fog not too far away.																						
178	174		301									Noctis jumps down deftly from the tree, and No. 21 follows suit, landing by his side on all four limbs.

202	196		301								Eerie Voice?	Hehe... hehehe...																						
203	197		301									Within the canopy, a burst of strange and distant laughter zips from branch to branch, giggling nonstop, like a signal transmitting in a nervous system.

215	208		301								Vera	...Did I see what?	1																					
216	209		301									Normally speaking, connected Constructs and commandants would have their senses affecting each other, but Vera does not seem to be affected by whatever you just saw.																						
217	210		301									Although you have been getting memories replayed from your corrupted Mind Beacon after your last battle with Luna... this kind of twisted vision is unprecedented. And that sense of familiarity... What is going on?!																						
218	211		301									Besides... what you just experienced kind of felt like a memory replay, but not entirely. For a moment, you are flooded by the feeling of nostalgia, as if you had been here before, having seen this place at its prime.																						
219	212		301									Has the corruption worsened? Or was the illusion a result of your mental stress?																						
220	213		301								Vera	What is it? 【kuroname】?	1

232	225		301							1	Vera	Something doesn't line up indeed. Even though the Punishing Virus concentration is within the norm here, it doesn't make sense that we haven't run into any Corrupted at all. Things are going... too smoothly.	1
