14	14		301									On the other side of the rope, a large black figure is pulled over the slope and rolls on the ground.

27	27		301								Roland	(...?)																						
28	28		301									Roland only remembers himself struggling to crawl out the underground waterway. But he doesn't see the wasteland outside—																						
29	29		301									There is only darkness.																						
30	30		301									Roland is engulfed by endless darkness. It feels gentle and comfortable, almost like amniotic fluid, just not that warm.																						
31	31		301									Roland tries to turn his head, but it doesn't respond. The other parts of his body probably won't be any different.																						
32	32		301									—He finds himself imprisoned inside the gentle darkness.																						
33	33		301								Roland	(I can't make a sound...)																						
34	34		301								Roland	(No, it's more like I can't feel my mouth.)																						
35	35		301								Roland	(What happened... to me?)

57	57		301								Roland	(Happened after that...? How long have I... been like this?)

65	65		301									Finally, Roland can no longer sense Alpha's footsteps. He leans on the wall behind as the broken spine could no longer support his upper body.																						
66	66		301									The visual signals sent back to his M.I.N.D. only contain image noise. His eyes only see darkness. The visual module must be completely broken.																						
67	67		301									The left arm has no response as expected, because it is long gone.																						
68	68		301									Roland lost too much strength escaping the cavern after the Red Tide devoured it, not to mention that he searched the entire underground waterway system when he realized Luna was lost.																						
69	69		301									But his search wasn't completely fruitless. At least...																						
70	70		301									Roland checks his frame again, only to find that most functions are either destroyed or forced to shut down, and those still running are not far from being completely broken.																						
71	71		301									How terribly clumsy of me. I'm afraid this body won't be suitable for children to watch.																						
72	72		301									All the random memories and thoughts make Roland's mind wander even further. Roland shakes his head, forcing himself to stay awake.

108	108		301									Roland's senses are shut down one by one as he loses more vital fluid. He weakly rebuts the shadows as they mock him.																						
109	109		301									...Will Constructs go to a cyber heaven after they die?																						
110	110		301									I probably should go to hell though.																						
111	111		301									It's no longer a place he doesn't mind going anytime, though.

120	120		301								Roland	(...?)																						
121	121		301									Roland is befuddled for a brief second, then he laughs. At least he thinks he is laughing.																						
122	122		301								Roland	(I heard of this near-death "M.I.N.D. damage" experience before, but it's another thing when it really happens to me... How funny.)																						
123	123		301								Roland	(Gabriel would love to see this.)																						
124	124		301								Roland	(But I never dreamed that angels would come pick me up one day.)																						
125	125		301									The light spot is still moving closer. It's very slow but unstoppable.																						
126	126		301								Roland	(...Will there really be a heaven for me?)																						
127	127		301								Roland	(If hell is where I belong... I don't mind this color...)

138	138		301									It's a tent.																						
139	139		301									Roland sees a piece of shabby canvas on a few wooden sticks. It can hardly be called a "tent."																						
140	140		301									The canvas is pretty worn out, but doesn't have any big holes, only some small openings that let wind come in, making a whoosh sound.																						
141	141		301									Roland is lying right underneath it.																						
142	142		301								Roland	...What?																						
143	143		301									Roland can finally hear his own voice, a sign that he seems to be regaining control of his body.																						
144	144		301									—He tries to lift his right hand again. This time he succeeds.																						
145	145		301								Roland	What... is this?																						
146	146		301									The structure looks nothing like his old hand. It still does what he wants it to do, but with a different look.																						
147	147		301									Roland doubtfully tries to touch his right hand with his left hand.																						
148	148		301									Only to find his left hand also somewhat different.																						
149	149		301								Roland	What happened to me...?																						
150	150		301									More confusion builds inside Roland as he sits up.																						
151	151		301									He sees his chain blade and gun, and he picks them up without hesitation.																						
152	152		301									The familiar weapons feel just the same, calming him down slightly.																						
153	153		201							1	500334																							
154	154		301							1	Roland	Whoever it is... They don't seem to be hostile so far.	1

156	156		202							1					1

160	160		202							1					1																			
161	161		301									Roland sees a female sitting next to the campfire.																						
162	162		301									Realizing Roland is awake, she slightly tilts her head toward his direction.																						
163	163		301									A hood covers most of her face. He can only see a mysterious smile.																						
164	164		201							1	500333		-450																					
165	165		201							2	500334		450																					
166	166		301							1	???	Are you awake?	1																					
167	167		301								Roland	...Are you the Merciful One?	2																					
168	168		301								The Merciful One	...I've been making a lot of self-introductions recently.	1																					
169	169		301									With most of her face concealed, the female seems slightly annoyed and chuckles. She thinks for a while.																						
170	170		301								The Merciful One	Right, that's how they call me.	1																					
171	171		301									The Merciful One gives a straight forward answer, still looking as calm as always.																						
172	172		301								Roland	I know you.	2																					
173	173		301								Roland	I have heard of this agent who... "gives one extra chance to whoever she deems suitable, regardless of whether they are good or evil, friend or foe."	2																					
174	174		301									As far as Roland knows, only one agent does this.																						
175	175		301									Although the "repairs" she made were more like "restructuring."																						
176	176		301									He slowly turns his wrists, checking every part of the body until he can confirm they are intact.																						
177	177		301								Roland	Why did you save me?	2																					
178	178		301								The Merciful One	Regardless of whether they are good or bad, people always remember their "unfinished businesses" when they are about to die.	1																					
179	179		301								The Merciful One	Some had things they wanted to do but couldn't, some had incomplete research that was supposed to uncover the truth, some wanted to make temporary peace eternal...	1																					
180	180		301								The Merciful One	As for me... Sometimes I thought, "What a beautiful day." "These randomly picked herbs actually made good, sweet tea." "That rat must have smelled the tea. It was a cute one."	1																					
181	181		301								The Merciful One	...So why not give them another chance?	1																					
182	182		301								The Merciful One	Would you like some herbal tea? This is surprisingly sweet.	1																					
183	183		301									The Merciful One poured a cup of tea from the container and passed it to Roland.																						
184	184		301									It's not an order or invitation, but somehow she can get others to do what she says.																						
185	185		301									Roland takes the cup and frowns at its strange scent.																						
186	186		301								The Merciful One	But... of all the kids I saved, you have the most special reaction.	1																					
187	187		204							2	2																							
188	188		301								Roland	Because I know you are around.	2																					
189	189		301								Roland	"The Merciful One."	2																					
190	190		301								The Merciful One	...Hmm?	1																					
191	191		204							2																								
192	192		301								Roland	"Giving a chance to whoever she deems suitable, regardless of whether they are good or evil, friend or foe."	2																					
193	193		301									That search wasn't fruitless after all, for Roland saw that figure who walked through the darkness with ease. He heard the self-introduction she made to Alpha.																						
194	194		301									Normal procedures couldn't heal his wounds. Even if he asked Alpha to stay, he wouldn't be saved.																						
195	195		301								Roland	I "asked" for help, but I wasn't sure if you really would respond.	2																					
196	196		301								Roland	Guess I won the bet.	2																					
197	197		301									Her eyes slightly widen with surprise, but she soon puts the gentle smile back on her face.																						
198	198		301								The Merciful One	You're a smart kid.	1																					
199	199		301								The Merciful One	Telling a lie without blinking takes some serious effort.	1																					
200	200		204							2	2																							
201	201		301								Roland	I was the most famous actor during the late Golden Age after all.	2																					
202	202		301									Roland smiles and takes an exaggerated bow, as if he is trying to prove his words.																						
203	203		301								Roland	Don't get me wrong. I'm very grateful that you saved me.	2																					
204	204		301								Roland	If my life ends here, the world would be a lot less interesting.	2																					
205	205		301								Roland	And that really concerns me... Especially for what I'm about to do.	2																					
206	206		301								The Merciful One	Is it for that white kid?	1																					
207	207		301								The Merciful One	I remember her. "Luna" is her name.	1																					
208	208		204							2																								
209	209		301								The Merciful One	She's lost, but the power she gave you is still around.	1																					
210	210		301									She says it very casually, as if it doesn't matter at all.																						
211	211		301									But Roland tenses up immediately after hearing Luna's name. He even feels his chain blade and gun heavier than usual.																						
212	212		301								Roland	Have you peeked into my life, "agent"?	2																					
213	213		301									Alerted by Merciful One's words, Roland quietly clenches the trigger, but lets it go after thinking again.																						
214	214		301									She saw it, didn't she? But what can I do? She and Luna are both agents, and both possess this power.																						
215	215		301									And even after seeing everything, she is still not showing any hostility.																						
216	216		301									That's not necessarily bad for Roland.																						
217	217		301								The Merciful One	Yeah, I did.	1																					
218	218		301								The Merciful One	Looks like... You are still lost, just like those kids.	1																					
219	219		301								Roland	So?	2																					
220	220		301								The Merciful One	That's not a question to ask me. You should ask yourself.	1																					
221	221		301								Roland	?	2																					
222	222		301								The Merciful One	So, what are you going to do?	1																					
223	223		301								Roland	The question is mine.	2																					
224	224		301								The Merciful One	I do not matter here.	1																					
225	225		301								The Merciful One	If you think I'm an interference, or obstacle, feel free to leave. Or, you can wait until the sun rises, then I will leave myself.	1																					
226	226		301								Roland	...I don't know if I can trust you.	2																					
227	227		301								The Merciful One	...Pff.	1																					
228	228		301									The Merciful One chuckles, as if she has heard something funny—																						
229	229		301								The Merciful One	So what?	1																					
230	230		301									Roland realizes why she was chuckling.																						
231	231		204							2	2																							
232	232		301								Roland	...Yeah, so what.	2																					
233	233		202							1	2				1																			
234	234		301									No matter what, she has given him a second chance... A third chance, actually.																						
235	235		301									The Merciful One is the person who is most likely to help him at this moment. Even if he ends up getting nothing done, this is his only chance to ask.																						
236	236		301									Roland feels like something in his heart has suddenly untangled, so he opens up.																						
237	237		301									He talks about Luna, Alpha, and how the group of Ascendants ended up falling apart.																						
238	238		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The Merciful One only listens, taking sips of herbal tea every now and then.

242	242		301							1		She finally puts down the container after Roland finishes talking. It was empty long ago.																						
243	243		301								The Merciful One	I couldn't help it when the tea was so nice.	1																					
244	244		301								Roland	...	2																					
245	245		204							2	2																							
246	246		301								Roland	...Of course.	2																					
247	247		301									Before Roland can realize, he has already unclenched his fists. The fierce, aggressive look disappears from his eyes.																						
248	248		301								The Merciful One	You know very well what you need to do next, don't you?	1																					
249	249		204							2																								
250	250		301								Roland	?	2																					
251	251		301								The Merciful One	Maybe you just purposely ignored your own feelings.	1

253	253		301								The Merciful One	And I can't help you to either.	1																					
254	254		301									The Merciful One throws a few more wood chips in the fire. She looks around, but cannot find any more.																						
255	255		301								The Merciful One	...Where did that kid go? I asked her to pick up more firewood.	1																					
256	256		301								Roland	I didn't know you also took in companions.	2																					
257	257		301								The Merciful One	...I don't, but I just happened to be staying at the same place with her.	1																					
258	258		301								The Merciful One	She seemed to be walking a lot faster, so I asked her for a little favor.	1

261	261		301								The Merciful One	Oh, here she is. At least I don't have to start the fire again.	1																					
262	262		301									After some rustling, Lamia shows up with a bundle of firewood behind her—																						
263	263		301								The Merciful One	Great, you're finally back.	1

271	271		301									Roland and Lamia look at each other, startled. The next moment, Lamia realizes what's going on and immediately turns back, trying to flee—

273	273		201							2	500334		450																					
274	274		301							1	The Merciful One	Sit, Lamia.	1																					
275	275		301								The Merciful One	Running from others is very impolite.	1																					
276	276		301									The Merciful One's words stun Lamia, who docilely turns around and sits on her legs.																						
277	277		301								The Merciful One	Good girl.	1																					
278	278		301									She then turns toward Roland—																						
279	279		301								The Merciful One	She was running away the moment she saw you... Do you know each other?	1																					
280	280		301								Roland	...I think so?	2																					
281	281		301								The Merciful One	Is she your enemy?	1																					
282	282		301								Roland	...More like a comrade.	2																					
283	283		301								The Merciful One	Very interesting. Since you are comrades, it's better to talk than to fight.	1																					
284	284		202							1	2				1																			
285	285		301									The Merciful One picks a firewood from Lamia's bunch, then breaks it up and tosses it into the fire.

289	289		301							1	The Merciful One	Remember what I said? We were just staying in the same place by coincidence. I'll leave when the sun is up.	1																					
290	290		301								Lamia	...	3																					
291	291		301								The Merciful One	...I have said it many times. Are you still thinking about following me in the stealth mode?	1																					
292	292		301								Lamia	...!	3																					
293	293		301								The Merciful One	Your camouflage can fool Babylonia and other Ascendants, but not me.	1																					
294	294		301								Lamia	...	3																					
295	295		301									As Lamia falls silent, the rising sun begins to cast a rosy hue across the line of mountains, making the shadows under the tent slightly darker.																						
296	296		301								The Merciful One	Well, now the sun's up... I've got to go.	1																					
297	297		301								The Merciful One	Since you know each other, I will leave it to you to fix your own problems.	1																					
298	298		301								Roland	...Can I ask one last question before you leave?	2																					
299	299		301								The Merciful One	?	1																					
300	300		301								Roland	Why do they call you "The Merciful One"?	2																					
301	301		301								The Merciful One	...	1																					
302	302		301								The Merciful One	They gave me this name, yet you are asking me for the reason.	1

308	308		301									The Merciful One has left. She didn't take the tent or anything with her.																						
309	309		301									Perhaps this tent and campfire are just another thing she "meets" on her journey.

315	315		301									Roland and Lamia stare at each other in silence. It's been a while since they last met, but the air is filled with tension.																						
316	316		301									Roland remembers that Lamia has been on radio silence for a while during Ascendant operations. He starts to feel suspicious.																						
317	317		301									While Lamia knows very well that Roland would question her for not showing up, she can never tell him what really happened.

322	322		301									—He is still "Roland", and she has seen what that "Roland" can do.																						
323	323		301									No matter what, she can't afford to infuriate him, so...
