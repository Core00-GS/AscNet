8	8		301									The beach volleyball cuts a beautiful arc through the air.																						
9	9		301									Looks like it is coming this way. You pull back a little to get a clean angle to return the ball...																						
10	10		301									...When a tall figure suddenly passes in front of you and eats into the ball's trajectory—Kamui.																						
11	11		201							1	1081001	1																						
12	12		301							1	Kamui	Aaah! Commandant! Move outta the way!	1																					
13	13		301									Tunnel-visioned by the ball, Kamui comes dashing over, trying to hit it back to the opponent's court. He tries to brake before he crashes into you, but instead, he hurls himself over from the sudden pause.																						
14	14		301								Kamui	—!!	1																					
15	15		401							2	1512																							
16	16		301			RImgBg1Shake						And you both end up in a pile on the beach.																						
17	17		301			PanelActor1Shake						—Thump. The ball falls primly on Kamui's head and bounces, then lands.																						
18	18		301									—Beep! The system sound for the winner rings.																						
19	19		201							1	500173																							
20	20		301							1	Lee	2-1, Liv and I win.	1

22	22		201							1	1081001	17																						
23	23		301							1		Kamui crawls to his feet.																						
24	24		301								Kamui	I've never lost a game before!	1																					
25	25		302								Kamui...	26																						
26	26		302								Remember to work as a team next time.	27	Don't go at it alone all the time.	27																				
27	27		301								Kamui	Sorry, Commandant! My body just moves by itself!	1																					
28	28		302								It's fine...	29	Yep, very Kamui.	29																				
29	29		201							1	500174																							
30	30		301							1	Liv	If this wasn't a game, Commandant would have got hurt earlier.	1																					
31	31		301								Liv	Well... I know Kamui often goes on solo missions, but when we operate as a unit, it's important to work with the other members.	1																					
32	32		301									Liv sounds serious.																						
33	33		201							1	1081001	1																						
34	34		301							1	Kamui	Got it.	1																					
35	35		201							1	500173																							
36	36		301							1	Lee	Winning or losing does hinge on your teammates, huh.	1																					
37	37		201							1	1081001	17

44	44		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The temperature seems to have warmed up a little. There is a momentary distortion in the scene in front.																						
45	45		301									A girl, as if out of a dream, is standing by the sea. The sea breeze lifts the frills of her swimsuit, and she reaches out to keep her hair from fluttering in the wind. She smiles and stretches out her hand this way.																						
46	46		201							1	500174	1																						
47	47		301							1	Liv	Commandant, do you need my help to put on sunscreen?	1																					
48	48		302								Liv?	49	...?	49																				
49	49		301								Lee	Wait.																						
50	50		401							2	1516																							
51	51		301									The boy in the diving suit gets to his feet on the beach and walks toward you. Beads of water slide down the side of his face as he raises a hand to wipe his face with a towel. He looks at you with a serious expression.																						
52	52		201							1	500173																							
53	53		301							1	Lee	It's better to leave this sort of work to me.	1																					
54	54		302								Lee?	55	??	55																				
55	55		201							1	500166	6																						
56	56		301							1	Lucia	We mustn't trouble Commandant. I've been with Commandant the longest, so... let me do this.	1																					
57	57		302								Why is Lucia here too?	58	I don't think how long we know each other matters.	58																				
58	58		202							1																								
59	59		301									What is going on? The place is getting hotter and hotter somehow.																						
60	60		301									It must be because of the season. The summer sun is always so blinding, and the summer breeze blowing on the body is also...

71	71		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Suddenly, the Gray Raven and the beach disappear, replaced by scarlet fog rising around you.																						
72	72		301									Your thoughts suddenly become muddled, and in the chaotic darkness, there seems to be someone talking to you.																						
73	73		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				???	...Friend...

78	78		302								?!	79																						
79	79		301								Lee	It wasn't even that long and you dozed off... You might want to get some actual rest in your room.	1																					
80	80		302								I'm wide awake now.	81	...What's going on?	82																				
81	81	83	301								Lee	You better be.	1																					
82	82		301								Lee	Still half-asleep, are you...	1																					
83	83		201							1	1031001	1																						
84	84		301							1	Liv	The VR device Kamui brought had a malfunction just now, so Lee went to fix it. Then you fell asleep while waiting, Commandant...	1																					
85	85		301								Liv	But... What was that about "doing it on your own", Commandant?	1																					
86	86		302								Nothing, nothing!	87	This aside, has the device been repaired?	91																				
87	87		202							1																								
88	88		301									The three surround you with looks of suspicion in their eyes.

91	91		201							1	500026																							
92	92		301							1	Lee	Yeah, fixed.	1																					
93	93		301								Lee	I knew we can't trust the things that Kamui brings over.	1																					
94	94		302								Good job, Lee!	95																						
95	95		301								Lee	It won't do you any good to compliment me.	1																					
96	96		201							1	1081001	1																						
97	97		301							1	Kamui	Are you really okay, Commandant? Don't force yourself!	1																					
98	98		302								I'm fine.	99																						
99	99		204							1	2																							
100	100		301								Kamui	Good! Then let's continue!	1																					
101	101		301								Kamui	Next up... we play "Truth or Dare"!	1																					
102	102		201							1	1031001	7																						
103	103		301							1	Liv	What's truth or dare...?	1																					
104	104		201							1	1081001	1																						
105	105		301							1	Kamui	Oh, let's take a look at the rules... "Answer the question given by your teammates within the set time."	1																					
106	106		301								Kamui	"If you can't answer, or refuse to... You'll have to perform a daring forfeit!"	1																					
107	107		301								Kamui	"The questions can be selected from a list in the system, or you can ask your own questions." Hmm... This is a multi-player thing, so this is my first time playing this too.	1																					
108	108		201							1	1031001	6																						
109	109		301							1	Liv	It sounds somewhat similar to tactical response training. Commandant and I developed a similar training program before. Commandant would ask the questions, and I'd answer...	1																					
110	110		201							1	1081001	1																						
111	111		301							1	Kamui	Oh! Liv, you have experience playing this? Then you and Commandant go first!	1																					
112	112		302								Sure.	113																						
113	113		201							1	1031001																							
114	114		301							1	Liv	I will think about it carefully and try to get the right answer!	1																					
115	115		302								Relax, this is just a game.	116	This is not training, no need to be so nervous.	118
