7	7		301							1	Lee	—And that's the end of our reports. Commandant, are we dismissed?	2																					
8	8		302								Of course. Thanks, guys.	9																						
9	9		301								Lucia	Now that this is done, we should return to help with Asimov's project.	3																					
10	10		301								Liv	In that case, Commandant, have a good rest.	1																					
11	11		301									As the three of them are about to leave, a familiar voice halts them.

14	14		301							1	Ayla	Excuse me—	1																					
15	15		201							1	500166																							
16	16		301							1	Lucia	Ayla? Is there something you need from us?	1																					
17	17		201							1	500110																							
18	18		301							1	Ayla	Oh, you're all here as well! That's great.	1																					
19	19		201							1	500026																							
20	20		301							1	Lee	We're actually on our way to Asimov to help with his...	1																					
21	21		201							1	500110																							
22	22		301							1	Ayla	Oh, don't mind that. He's busy with something else currently.	1																					
23	23		201							1	1031001																							
24	24		301							1	Liv	Asimov is dropping his research halfway through to work on something else...?	1																					
25	25		201							1	500110																							
26	26		301							1	Ayla	I bet you wouldn't have guessed that he's helping the WGAA with our Lunar New Year decorations!	1																					
27	27		302								No way! We're talking about Asimov, right?	28																						
28	28		201							1	500026	10																						
29	29		301							1	Lee	What have you done to make him comply...	1																					
30	30		201							1	500110	1																						
31	31		301							1	Ayla	That's a secret!	1																					
32	32		204							1																								
33	33		301									Ayla passes you the beautifully printed paper bag in her hands.																						
34	34		301								Ayla	I think this suits Gray Raven quite well. That's why I was thinking about you guys.	1																					
35	35		202							1					1																			
36	36		301									You see two lengthy, red sheets with large, clean calligraphy on them.																						
37	37		302								These are "couplets," aren't they?	38																						
38	38		201							1	500166																							
39	39		301							1	Lucia	I think I've seen it on the surface once... One of the decorations for Lunar New Year.	1																					
40	40		201							1	500110																							
41	41		301							1	Ayla	That's right. You put them by the two sides of the door.	1																					
42	42		202							1					1																			
43	43		301									Lee flips through the couplets, examining them.																						
44	44		201							1	500026																							
45	45		301							1	Lee	What's the point of sticking paper with words next to a door? And what is it that's written on them?	1																					
46	46		201							1	500110																							
47	47		301							1	Ayla	They are wishes for the new year, written in short and rhythmic, melodic phrases.	1																					
48	48		302								They do feel like poetry and songs.	49	It does sound lovely.	49																				
49	49		201							1	1031001	1																						
50	50		301							1	Liv	I bet they'll sound great if you sing them with music.	1																					
51	51		201							1	500110	4																						
52	52		301							1	Ayla	True... If Selena were here, she wouldn't hesitate to perform for us here and now. She would, I'm sure...	1																					
53	53		301									Ayla's smile freezes as she thinks about her disappeared teammate.	1																					
54	54		201							1	1031001																							
55	55		301							1	Liv	Ayla...	1																					
56	56		202							1					1																			
57	57		301									Ayla slightly taps herself on the face, stopping herself from the downward spiral.	1																					
58	58		201							1	500110	4																						
59	59		301							1	Ayla	Selena must be waiting for us to find her somewhere out there... That's why I won't give up on her.	1																					
60	60		201							1	500026	10																						
61	61		301								Lee	Of course. Our mission to reclaim Earth is far from over. We must keep going for the coming year.	1																					
62	62		202							1					1																			
63	63		301									Liv takes the couplets from Ayla's hands and nods.																						
64	64		201							1	1031001	1																						
65	65		301							1	Liv	Leave this to us—we just need to place them next to a door, right?	1																					
66	66		201							1	500110	1																						
67	67		301							1	Ayla	Yep! Put them up with some oomph!	1																					
68	68		302								What even qualifies as "oomph"...	69																						
69	69		202							1					1																			
70	70		301									Lucia takes the tools Ayla passes her and smiles.																						
71	71		201							1	500166	1																						
72	72		301							1	Lucia	Commandant, do you remember? This is just like our last mission when we all finished decorating the place together.	1																					
73	73		302								Of course I remember. It's just a while ago.	74																						
74	74		201							1	500110																							
75	75		301							1	Ayla	I envy you guys—you have so many wonderful adventures!	1																					
76	76		201							1	1031001

79	79		201							2	500166	1	450																					
80	80		301							1	Lucia	But as long as we are here with each other, there will be... wonder.	2																					
81	81		301								Liv	Well, if we're going to decorate Commandant's room, we should start working on it...	1																					
82	82		302								My room?	83	Hmm, that'd be nice.	84																				
83	83	87	301								Liv	Of course! Commandant, you're the one who represents Gray Raven.	1

88	88		201							1	500026																							
89	89		301							1	Lee	Leave the one on top to me. I'm probably more suited to deal with that height.	1

92	92		201							2	500166	1	450																					
93	93		301							1	Lucia	I'll leave it to you, then, Lee...	2																					
94	94		301								Liv	We can always count on you, Lee...	1																					
95	95		202							1	2				1																			
96	96		301									Within seconds, the couplets Ayla brought you are now properly placed outside your room.

98	98		301							1	Ayla	Hmm—it looks—fantastic!	1																					
99	99		201							1	1031001	1																						
100	100		301							1	Liv	...The calligraphy is beautiful! And the words are... meaningful, it seems.	1																					
101	101		201							1	500110	1																						
102	102		301							1	Ayla	Right? You couldn't have guessed it, but they are written by Yuan Ye, the CUB from earlier!	1																					
103	103		201							1	500026																							
104	104		301							1	Lee	You're saying that the AI system can write couplets? I wish I had opened it up to study when I had the chance...	1																					
105	105		201							1	500110	1																						
106	106		301							1	Ayla	That... is a secret.	1																					
107	107		302								Another secret?	108																						
108	108		204							1																								
109	109		301									Ayla crosses her arms and nods.																						
110	110		301								Ayla	Alright! The Gray Ravens have received their couplets, and I'm on my way to give the other squads their own!	1																					
111	111		301								Ayla	Before I go... Happy New Year! Commandant and the Gray Ravens, have a wonderful new year!	1																					
112	112		302								You too, Ayla! Happy New Year!	113
