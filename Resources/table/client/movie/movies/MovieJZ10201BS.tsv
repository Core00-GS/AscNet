6	6		301									Nikola stands stoically by a technician in a white labcoat as he frantically rattles off reading after reading.																						
7	7		301								Technician	Sir, are you sure about this? This is in violation of...	2																					
8	8		301							1	Nikola	We're simply reclaiming what is lost. In our current predicament, we cannot allow news of the incident to propagate.	3																					
9	9		301								Technician	But if we set this precedent, every Construct that follows...	2																					
10	10		301								Nikola	Then we'll make sure this is the last. Continue the upload!	3																					
11	11		301								Technician	80%.	2																					
12	12		301									At Nikola's insistence, the technician returns to reporting readings. As she interfaces with the terminal in front of her, her eyes linger on the figure behind the pane of transparent crystal.																						
13	13		301									In her hibernation, the young girl in black and red is curled up like a newborn baby. Countless wires trail from every point along her spine. More machine than human, she is unaware of the soul she is about to receive, or the person to which it used to belong.																						
14	14		301								Technician	Sorry...	2																					
15	15		301									The whispered apology escapes even the notice of Nikola. Afterwards, the technician grits her teeth and throws herself back into the procedure.																						
16	16		301								Nikola	The procedure is also worth documenting. Sisters... both capable of becoming Ascendant... She may hold the key to the Punishing Virus.	3																					
17	17		301								Technician	90%, sir. Your authentication is required.	2																					
18	18		301								Nikola	I authenticate, Level A, to proceed with activation of the new Construct, codename: Lotus.	3																					
19	19		301								Technician	100%, we have activation.	2																					
20	20		301									Klaxons blare as the Construct activates. Tremors run through the girl's body as her veins are filled with vital fluids.

24	24		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						By the time I became aware, I was already in the hall.																						
25	25		301									All around me are Military-grade Constructs like myself, living weapons built for the singular purpose of reclaiming Earth.																						
26	26		301									Parts of my memory data were blurry, likely already fragmented. The only data I recalled with any clarity was the combat training I have endured since becoming a military-use Construct.																						
27	27		301									Afterwards, Gestalt ran its evaluation of me, moving me from place to place, station to station, until I was finally assigned to a squad and sent into battle.																						
28	28		301									My name is Lucia... member of Gray Raven.																						
29	29		301									Gray Raven. I never understood the name. Maybe I do have memories of how it came to be, but it's nothing I want to remember.																						
30	30		301								Commandant A	Hey, did you find a suitable team?																						
31	31		301									Uniformed groups pass me by. I know them to be commandants, here to conduct the pairing tests. Us Constructs are also here to decide our futures.																						
32	32		301								Commandant B	A few of the teams look decent, but their organization falls a bit short of my expectations.																						
33	33		301								Commandant A	A bit short? We take what we can get, man. HQ's M.O. is balanced capabilities across the teams. We exist to fill in the missing piece in the center.																						
34	34		301								Commandant B	I get that. I just want a little more assurance. We are stepping into a battlefield, after all.																						
35	35		301								Commandant A	Heh... erring on the side of caution, are you? I guess scouting for a few more rounds won't hurt.																						
36	36		301									People keep passing us by. Occasionally, though, people also leave.																						
37	37		201							1	500019																							
38	38		301							1	Construct	We've been paying attention to your service record. It is our honor to serve as your team.	1																					
39	39		301								Relaxed Commandant	Nah, the honor's mine. I just picked the best team for my tactics.																						
40	40		301								Relaxed Commandant	The system does show that Suzaku has one more female Construct. Is she absent?																						
41	41		301								Construct	Tifa is a little shy. My apologies, Commandant. I will have her apologize to you directly.	1																					
42	42		301								Relaxed Commandant	I have a better idea.																						
43	43		301								Construct	A better idea...?	1																					
44	44		301								Relaxed Commandant	Popping by your HQ, of course. Tifa should be there, right?																						
45	45		301								Construct	Uh, th-that might not be the best idea.	1																					
46	46		301								Relaxed Commandant	It's now team regulations to spook misbehaving kids a little. Suzaku, fall out!																						
47	47		301								Construct	Wait... No. Understood. Fall out, Suzaku!	1																					
48	48		301								Commandant A	That's the loon from B Section, isn't it. Guy never got the notice to not run in the hallways...																						
49	49		202							1																								
50	50		301							1		No recruitment process is the same. Somehow, the squads do not show unease, nor nervousness for the battles to come. Instead...																						
51	51		301									They show complex, multi-faceted joy on their faces.																						
52	52		301									Disquieted, hollow, I was at odds with the room. I held no purpose, no expectations.																						
53	53		301									I was a shell. Beneath everyone's notice, I retreated against a wall. The white lights beat down on me like the noonday sun, and I felt I couldn't breathe.																						
54	54		301								Commandant C	What's up with that one...																						
55	55		301								Commandant D	Huh, our top gun's really here. And here I thought they were putting together a prima-donna squad for 'em.																						
56	56		301									All eyes were suddenly on the intruder, as if the very wind had changed directions and blown to the entrant's way.																						
57	57		301									Top gun. My receptors picked up the term tossed around in hushed conversation. Why someone like that, first among the commandants, find a team to match here?																						
58	58		301				DialogDisable					But I did not look, because I knew it had nothing to do with me. I just had to do exactly what I did the day before: stand there, in my spot, and wait for the hour to strike the same mark as it had before.

61	62		301			DialogEnable					Lucia	Why... am I even here...																						
62	63		301									I bit my lip to stop the words, one hand on the wrist of the other, trying to keep myself from shaking.																						
63	64		301									Shaking... such a human facsimile for a mechanical body.																						
64	65		301									The people upstairs said that it was proof our minds were still human. For me, it inspired no humanity, only terror. If I could, I would...																						
65	66		301								???	Gray Raven.																						
66	67		301								Lucia	Huh?																						
67	68		301									I looked up at the mention of the name. In front of me stood a commandant, uniformed just like all the others, but somehow... different.																						
68	69		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				???	Yes.

71	72		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		After skimming through Gray Raven's data logs, that person gazed at me.																						
72	73		301								???	Are you alone?																						
73	74		301							1	Lucia	I...	1																					
74	75		301									For a moment, I was lost for words, the tortured syllables trapped in my approximation of a "throat". I realized that it was a system error from not having spoken to anyone in too long.																						
75	76		301									But the person did not press me for an answer, but instead, stood quietly in front of me, waiting.																						
76	77		301								Lucia	I'm...	1																					
77	78		301								Lucia	It's just me.	1																					
78	79		301									Fear and anticipation mixed with unrecognized emotion, translating into syllables that fell like bricks from my mouth. In their wake, there came a few seconds of silence.																						
79	80		301								???	What a coincidence. I'm by my lonesome too. What's your name?																						
80	81		301								Lucia	Lucia.	1																					
81	82		301									Grasping the outstretched hand, I felt my system logs create a new file under "Commandant".																						
82	83		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					—【kuroname】, the name I will learn to treasure above all others.
