3	3		301			DialogEnable						After a chaotic flash of red, Gabriel disappears above, leaving only Cinderelik floating in the air as she is pulled by four fish.																						
4	4		301									She quietly looks down at the platform below like a doll hanging on a rope to dry.																						
5	5		301									Suddenly, Hetero-Creatures begin to pile up on the platform lift. Along with them, the Punishing concentration also begins to rise. Fortunately, the trio's special reinforcements for this mission barely manage to keep the corruption rate just below critical.

11	11		202							1	2	3			1																			
12	12		301									With concerted effort, the Hetero-Creatures begin to decrease in number under the trio's barrage of firepower.

14	14		301							1	Cinderelik	...	1

26	26		301									The platform lift begins to shake violently. The accumulating Punishing Virus transforms into a red electric current, climbing up the platform and into her wing.																						
27	27		301									The wing begins to expand under the effects of the Punishing Virus. A radiant red light envelops Cinderelik.																						
28	28		301									Amid the blinding light, she descends to the base of the platform.																						
29	29		301									The ball of light enveloping Cinderelik leaves a trail of crimson snowflakes. The remains at the base of the platform begin to shake under its powerful force.																						
30	30		301									Chrome sprints toward the blinding ball of light, slicing the red current with his scythe. His blade rends the Hetero-Creatures protecting Cinderelik in twain, and the tip of his scythe penetrates the heart of the blinding light from above.																						
31	31		301									However, a deafening rumble reveals that the remains of the Heteo-Creatures have taken a new shape.

35	35		301							1	Chrome	Jitterbombs?	1																					
36	36		301									Even though the explosive power of a Jitterbomb is not particularly strong, such a large number in the confined space is sure to be fatal.																						
37	37		301								Kamui	Where'd Cinderelik go?!	2																					
38	38		301									With the platform now covered in glowing red Jitterbombs, Cinderelik is gone without a trace.																						
39	39		301								Chrome	Get to higher ground! NOW!	1																					
40	40		301									Chrome fires a grappling hook to the top of the shaft, hooking onto a wall.																						
41	41		301								Kamui	You sure came prepared, Captain!	2																					
42	42		301								Chrome	Grab onto me!	1																					
43	43		301								Kamui	Got it!	2																					
44	44		202							1	2	3			1																			
45	45		301									Kamui grabs onto Wanshi's collar, then lunges and grabs onto Chrome's ankle as he is hoisted into the air.																						
46	46		301									Right as the trio is hoisted into the upper rafters of the shaft, the thunderous boom of an explosion comes from below.																						
47	47		201							1	1081001																							
48	48		301							1	Kamui	That's my captain! We were almost—	1																					
49	49		201							1	500308																							
50	50		301							1	Cinderelik	Why didn't you do that earlier?	1																					
51	51		202							1					1																			
52	52		301									Before Kamui could finish speaking, Cinderelik appears before them and unleashes a downpour of arrow-like plumes coated in concentrated Punishing Virus.																						
53	53		301									Hanging onto Chrome, Kamui and Wanshi are certain they are unable to dodge the barrage in time. But to their surprise, Chrome releases the pulley on the grappling hook, causing the trio to rappel rapidly.																						
54	54		301									The barrage of feathers originally aimed at Kamui and Wanshi are now aimed directly at Chrome.																						
55	55		301									A bolt of lightning vaporizes a majority of the feathers. However, a few still manage to find their mark on Chrome's shoulder.																						
56	56		201							1	500155

61	61		301							1	Chrome	Brace for landing!	1																					
62	62		202							1					1																			
63	63		301									The trio rappels firmly onto the base of the platform, then looks up at Cinderelik.																						
64	64		201							1	500155																							
65	65		301							1	Chrome	Because the limited speed of the grappling hook is prone to turning us into a moving target.	1																					
66	66		201							1	500308																							
67	67		301							1	Cinderelik	...	1																					
68	68		201							1	1081001																							
69	69		301							1	Kamui	Right as you said "turn back time," those things turned into Jitterbombs. Is that what you once were?	1																					
70	70		201							1	500308																							
71	71		301							1	Cinderelik	...Mimicry, camouflage.	1																					
72	72		301								Cinderelik	This is something that almost all creatures do.	1																					
73	73		301									Cinderelik reaches out her hand and strokes her wing.																						
74	74		204							1	8																							
75	75		301								Cinderelik	It used to do that when it was little, so...	1																					
76	76		201							1	500273																							
77	77		301							1	Wanshi	...Is that why you pray to the past?	1																					
78	78		202							1					1																			
79	79		301									Cinderelik furrows her brows to the trio's surprise. She quietly waves farewell as the fish carry her away.																						
80	80		201							1	1081001																							
81	81		301							1	Kamui	You're running away, too?	1

83	83		301							1	Cinderelik	...It's here.	1																					
84	84		202							1					1																			
85	85		301									She points her slender finger up as a dark, stalwart figure descends from above.																						
86	86		301									It appears with a familiar figure.																						
87	87		201							1	500179																							
88	88		301							1	Gabriel	Seeing as you passed the test, you are deserving of a more fitting reception.	1																					
89	89		301								Gabriel	Witness der Meister's creation.	1																					
90	90		301									A hissing roar fills the area, causing their audio modules to tremble. Somehow, they sense sadness and despair emanating from the stalwart figure.																						
91	91		301								Gabriel	Such an opportunity is a rare treat. Let me give you a bonus question.	1																					
92	92		301								Gabriel	How many Constructs from Babylonia do you think it is assembled from?	1
