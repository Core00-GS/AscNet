3	3		301									No matter where she hides, the Corrupted called Korolev is always hot on her trail and always finds her.																						
4	4		301									She tries fighting but fails miserably, convincing her that she has no hope of defeating an enemy like this.																						
5	5		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Eventually, she somehow coincidentally finds herself in the place she was looking for‚Äîthe communications room.

7	7		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Inside the communications room...																						
8	8		301									The strenuous movements have caused Selena's vital fluid to seep out of every opening, and she can feel that her body, which is already approaching its limit, is about to fall apart.																						
9	9		301									She musters her remaining strength to barricade the entrance with what she can find and staggers over to the communications station.

18	18		301			RImgBg1Shake						The giant Corrupted is frenziedly slamming against the barricade.																						
19	19		201							1	500283																							
20	20		301							1	Selena	Is this end of the road for me...	1																					
21	21		301									In her hurry, she can only load the data she is subconsciously most familiar with into the space station's Disruptive Signal.																						
22	22		204							1	8																							
23	23		301								Selena	...	1																					
24	24		301								Selena	If... Ayla gets this, she'll definitely understand it.	1

34	34		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory110.png																								
35	35		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						In the time she takes to prepare for battle, Korolev manages to cover the distance between them.

37	37		301						1000			Her weapon snaps under the impact of Korolev's attack.																						
38	38		401							2	1506																							
39	39		301			RImgBg1Shake						There is a loud bang as Korolev hurls Selena against the wall.																						
40	40		301									Korolev does not give her time to catch her breath and slams its robotic arm down onto her back.																						
41	41		301									The robot is not small, but it sure is nimble.																						
42	42		201							1	500119																							
43	43		301							1	Korolev	When visiting the space station, please follow the rules and regulations and listen to your guide.	1																					
44	44		301								Korolev	Children who vandalize and destroy space station facilities will be punished.	1																					
45	45		301								Korolev	I've finally got you. You're a very disobedient child. Not only have you vandalized the facilities, you've also stolen valuable "public property."	1																					
46	46		301								Korolev	Come on, return what you stole to Korolev.	1																					
47	47		301								Korolev	A child who owns up to their mistakes is a good child.	1

50	50		301							1	Selena	What is the goal of this Corrupted...?	1																					
51	51		301									She glances down at the geometric core shard in her hands.																						
52	52		204							1	4																							
53	53		301								Selena	No... This is one thing I can never hand over to you.	1																					
54	54		202							1					1																			
55	55		301									Selena started to struggle again, and with her final desperate burst, she managed to shake the AI robot off her.																						
56	56		301									Taking advantage of the robot's attempt to stabilize itself on its robotic legs, she dodged to the corner of the room.																						
57	57		301									I must protect the shard... This came at the cost of the entire Advance Force's sacrifice.																						
58	58		301									What should I do...?																						
59	59		301									Korolev is blocking the entrance, and her weapon has been destroyed. It's a desperate situation with no chances of survival.																						
60	60		301									At the very least, I must...																						
61	61		301									Selena's eyes narrow.																						
62	62		401							2	1505																							
63	63		301									In an instant, she turns the pointy end of the shard toward her chest and stabs it straight in.																						
64	64		201							1	500119																							
65	65		301							1	Korolev	A child who doesn't own up to their mistakes is a naughty child.	1																					
66	66		301									Korolev, who had regained its balance "looked" at Selena, who had the shard hidden in her chest.																						
67	67		301									It charged toward her, once again crushing her left arm with its own.																						
68	68		301								Korolev	The item you stole, where did you hide it?	1																					
69	69		301									Pain signals flooded Selena's M.I.N.D.																						
70	70		201							1	500283	14																						
71	71		301							1	Selena	Ugh‚Äî!	1																					
72	72		301								Selena	Are you the space station's AI?	1																					
73	73		301									Being a Corrupted, it obviously was not able to answer her.																						
74	74		301								Selena	To have become what you are... It's truly tragic.	1																					
75	75		201							1	500119																							
76	76		301								Korolev	Korolev has always been like this. What are you talking about?	1																					
77	77		201							1	500283	14																						
78	78		301							1	Selena	You're just a puppet of the Punishing Virus.	1																					
79	79		202							1					1																			
80	80		301									The Corrupted before her was supposed to be the Guidance AI of this space station.																						
81	81		301									To make it more approachable to children, its words and actions were programmed to be as innocent as those of a child.																						
82	82		301									The robotic arm pinning her down even bears childish graffiti left by children who used to visit.																						
83	83		301									And now, it is nothing more than a killing machine.																						
84	84		201							1	500119																							
85	85		301							1	Korolev	A good child doesn't gossip about others.	1																					
86	86		301								Korolev	But Korolev is forgiving. Just hand it over.	1																					
87	87		301								Korolev	If you don't, Korolev will activate punishing mode.	1																					
88	88		301								Korolev	According to the rules and regulations of the space station, Korolev has the right to use minimal levels of violence.	1																					
89	89		301									Selena observes it calmly.																						
90	90		301								Korolev	What's the matter? Why aren't you moving?	1																					
91	91		301								Korolev	Very well.	1																					
92	92		301								Korolev	The following demonstration will serve as a warning to children on the repercussions of not following the rules and regulations.	1																					
93	93		301								Korolev	The priority is to get the thief to return the stolen object to the owner.	1

97	97		301									Two robotic arms suddenly crush her left hand and rip it off.																						
98	98		301			RImgBg1Shake					Selena	...Ugh‚Äîaaargh!																						
99	99		301									The pain from having her arm ripped off is so great that Selena could not stop herself from crying out.																						
100	100		301									She cannot think.																						
101	101		301								Korolev	It looks like the thief didn't hide the item in her left hand.	1																					
102	102		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Korolev	Then let's take a look at another body part.	1
