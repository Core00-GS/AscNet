5	5		301									As long as she continues on this path, she will become the person she dreamed to become one day.

8	8		301							1	Ayla	...Alright. I just need a little bit more olive green... And add some contrast...	1

14	14		301							1	Ayla	Ma'am? One sec, I'm packing up!	1																					
15	15		201							1	500114																							
16	16		301							1	Meka	...That lady is waiting for you downstairs. You got plans today?	1																					
17	17		201							1	500110																							
18	18		301							1	Ayla	Yeah, I need to talk to them about the new exhibition proposal.	1																					
19	19		301								Ayla	...I wish I could just stay at home painting all the time.	1																					
20	20		301								Ayla	As long as I keep making great works, there won't be any problem.	1																					
21	21		301								Ayla	They should just give me a calm and peaceful environment, so I can focus on my art!	1																					
22	22		301								Ayla	Gosh. I'm just not good at this proposal thing.	1																					
23	23		201							1	500114																							
24	24		301							1	Meka	Well, sometimes going out isn't too bad.	1																					
25	25		301								Meka	You get to relax a little, and you may get inspiration from visiting different places and seeing different people and things, don't you think?	1																					
26	26		201							1	500110																							
27	27		301							1	Ayla	There won't be any inspiration. I have been to every place in Babylonia.	1																					
28	28		301								Ayla	If I see the same view over and over again, I may even get bored and start to hate what I'm doing.	1																					
29	29		201							1	500114																							
30	30		301							1	Meka	Well... Ayla, you have grown a lot.	1

35	35		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Exhibition Manager	Ayla! You made me wait for 15 minutes again!																						
36	36		201							1	500110																							
37	37		301							1	Ayla	Huh? Does it matter? I was fine-tuning some details.	1																					
38	38		202							1					1																			
39	39		301								Exhibition Manager	I know your works are great, but the proposal is equally important!																						
40	40		301								Exhibition Manager	If we don't have a good spot, no matter how great your works are, they won't catch a lot of attention.																						
41	41		201							1	500110																							
42	42		301							1	Ayla	That's not possible. Even if my works are displayed in a corner, they won't be ignored.	1																					
43	43		202							1					1																			
44	44		301								Exhibition Manager	...You really give me headaches. Confidence is great, but...																						
45	45		201							1	500110																							
46	46		301							1	Ayla	Selena is coming today, right? I haven't seen her for a while. We were debating about ancient sculptures.	1																					
47	47		202							1					1																			
48	48		301								Exhibition Manager	Oh, about that...																						
49	49		301								Exhibition Manager	I can only tell you that she's not coming today. You may want to read her mail first.																						
50	50		201							1	500110																							
51	51		301							1	Ayla	Mail? I didn't get any.	1																					
52	52		202							1					1																			
53	53		301								Exhibition Manager	No, for some reason, she couldn't send it to your terminal.																						
54	54		301								Exhibition Manager	So she wrote a paper letter and asked me to pass it to you. Tsk, what an old-fashioned way.																						
55	55		201							1	500110	4																						
56	56		301							1	Ayla	Couldn't send it? What happened...	1																					
57	57		202							1					1																			
58	58		301								Exhibition Manager	Hmm, it actually may be a good thing, but I'm too ordinary to understand it... Just read it first.																						
59	59		301								Selena's Letter 064	It's been a while since we last met, Ayla. Four months?																						
60	60		301								Selena's Letter 064	It was your birthday and we celebrated your coming of age together. Too bad we spent all the time discussing great sculpture works.																						
61	61		301								Selena's Letter 064	So we never had the chance to properly sit down and talk.																						
62	62		301								Selena's Letter 064	Remember what I said about becoming a Construct?																						
63	63		301								Selena's Letter 064	You asked me why. Why not continue with a career in art?																						
64	64		301								Selena's Letter 064	If we keep doing what we are doing, our reputation, status, and living conditions will only get better.																						
65	65		301								Selena's Letter 064	...My answer is, art should not exist only in a world of our own.																						
66	66		301								Selena's Letter 064	I thought a lot. Born and raised in Babylonia, we took the peaceful, comfortable and abundant life for granted.																						
67	67		301								Selena's Letter 064	But that's only the world as we know it. Is that truly what it is?																						
68	68		301								Selena's Letter 064	I once read that all artworks were an imitation of natural objects.																						
69	69		301								Selena's Letter 064	What if our creations were based only on an unrealistic, partial impression of the real world?																						
70	70		301								Selena's Letter 064	It made me wonder. I wanted to discover what the real world is like.																						
71	71		301								Selena's Letter 064	Maybe our path would be rectified if we could portray the world as it truly is.																						
72	72		301								Selena's Letter 064	But I ended up shocked by the knowledge I found.																						
73	73		301								Selena's Letter 064	It turned out that outside the peaceful and harmonious world we lived in, there was another cruel world full of conflict and war.																						
74	74		301								Selena's Letter 064	Because of those people's hard work, or even sacrifice, we got to enjoy our peaceful lives.																						
75	75		301								Selena's Letter 064	I was traumatized, but I didn't want to tell you. We were raised with so much on our shoulders.																						
76	76		301								Selena's Letter 064	We must help humanity to survive, and pass on the knowledge and wisdom.																						
77	77		301								Selena's Letter 064	That's why I asked the WGAA to make me a Construct. And I succeeded.																						
78	78		301								Selena's Letter 064	Ah, I'm just writing down whatever comes to my mind. I'm afraid we won't be able to see each other again, but I'll try to keep in touch.																						
79	79		301								Selena's Letter 064	...Lastly, Ayla. I believe that neither of us has chosen the wrong way.																						
80	80		301								Selena's Letter 064	We will still fight together, for the same ultimate goal. Just in different worlds.																						
81	81		201							1	500110	4																						
82	82		301							1	Ayla	How could she...! She didn't even tell me before becoming a Construct...	1																					
83	83		301								Ayla	I can't take this! That's not what friends do to each other!	1																					
84	84		202							1					1																			
85	85		301								Exhibition Manager	Ayla, Selena left you a software that makes virtual theater plays. Seems like she came up with the original scripts.																						
86	86		301									...																						
87	87		301								Exhibition Manager	We are exhibiting a slightly modified version.																						
88	88		301								Exhibition Manager	If she left you the original, she must want you to understand how she felt in the beginning.																						
89	89		201							1	500110	4																						
90	90		301							1	Ayla	But I already know everything. What's the point of giving this to me now...	1																					
91	91		202							1					1																			
92	92		301								Exhibition Manager	Um, instead of feeling upset, why not be happy for your friend? She's found her way!																						
93	93		301								Exhibition Manager	Plus, Selena's position is quite special... Maybe you will get to work together again in the future!																						
94	94		201							1	500110																							
95	95		301							1	Ayla	Is that so...? You're right...	1																					
96	96		301								Ayla	Selena said it too... She hoped we could both excel in our own field.	1																					
97	97		301								Ayla	...Hmm. Okay!	1																					
98	98		301								Ayla	Anyway, thanks for passing this on to me. It means a lot. I'll cheer up.	1
