29	30		301									Being in the same room with the Hetero-Hive Mother and the twins, the Gray Ravens' Inver-Devices are getting hit twice as hard.																						
30	31		301									With that, Lee, Liv, and even Lucia with her specialized frame, are all briefly immobilized.																						
31	32		201							1	1031001	17																						
32	33		301							1		As the Gray Ravens struggle to counter the strikes and their frames accumulate wounds, Liv has finally figured out how the enemies are attacking them.																						
33	34		301									As you pull her away, she quickly tells you how the enemies are attacking you without moving at all.																						
34	35		301									The black, cylindrical pellet is the true face of the high-speed, flying attacker.																						
35	36		301									Even in the blink of an eye, Liv has still managed to catch that the pellet was the "bullet" you fired at the Hetero-Hive Mother previously.																						
36	37		301								Liv	...No.	1																					
37	38		301									That thing is not a bullet. It is an instance of them imitating your attack.																						
38	39		301									From her analysis, the damage dealt by this attack is far beyond that of a bullet for both humans and Constructs.																						
39	40		301									The twins can speak clearly, but that does not mean that they are beings capable of communicating with speech.																						
40	41		301									Because since their birth, all of you can feel their hostility intuitively.

43	44		301									It is clear they are angry because you have hurt their "mother"—the Hetero-Hive Mother.																						
44	45		301									You can see that Lee is leaning on the broken mechanical devices and shooting, while Lucia is kneeling nearby, supported by her blade.

50	51		301							1		The eyes of the twins are still hollow, but their hostility means you cannot let your guard down for a second.																						
51	52		301									Right now, their gaze pauses on Lucia and Lee, and several "bullets" start hovering near them.																						
52	53		301									You have to make a choice now...

55	56		301									You focus the power of your exoskeleton on your legs and dash toward Lucia.																						
56	57		301									The initial speed of the mimic bullets from the twins is not too high. If you ignore the side effects and push your exoskeleton, you might be able to do something before the bullets speed up.																						
57	58		301									The leg motors crack with the warning of overloading. The bullet grazes your back, but you manage to rush to Lucia's side at the last moment, pulling her away from the bullet's trajectory.

77	78		401							2	1510																							
78	79		301									Receiving his gun, you immediately fire toward Lucia.

80	81		301									The side effects begin to kick in, and your legs go limp, sending you and Lee tumbling down.

89	90		301							1		The weakened Hetero-Hive Mother stands in your way.																						
90	91		301									It is limping inside the pool of red and black liquid on the ground, with the shells broken off from the pain of birth scattered around it.																						
91	92		301									Its body slowly rises, the red structure that gave birth to the twins still bearing a clear scar. Black liquid spills out from there occasionally.																						
92	93		301									Even when weakened, it still raises its tentacles high, guarding the twins.
