3	3		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		After a while, Commandant and I have gotten used to regular drills in Babylonia's simulated training environments.																						
4	4		301									Though I longed for the battlefield, I couldn't step foot on it, as long as Gray Raven remained short-handed.																						
5	5		301								Commandant A	Hey, if it isn't "top gun" over there.																						
6	6		301								Commandant B	Just hanging out, 【kuroname】?																						
7	7		301								Commandant A	What more do you expect from HQ's number one sweetheart? I bet that Construct's just here for show, our toppa-the-class is just waiting on that promotion to Command Central.																						
8	8		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Commandant B	Gotta say, I do envy these internal promotions. Who else would have the privilege of getting an undermanned team and cheating their way out of deployment?																						
9	9		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				As a subordinate, I kept my cool and held my tongue, just as Commandant did.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
10	10		304							But I could not shake the fact that this happened because Commandant chose me.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
11	11		304							Every time I heard of these rumors, I would ask Commandant why I was chosen instead of the countless teams, ready and willing to fight.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
12	12		304							Commandant became top of the class fair and square. People will know that Commandant's abilities are above reproach, if only we can be deployed...	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
13	200		304							Because of this, I toyed with the idea of requesting a re-pairing.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
14	13		304							But every time I brought it up, Commandant would respond the same way, dispelling the notion.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
15	14		304							We're fine the way we are.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
16	15		304							As Commandant said it, over and over, I felt the germination of something I'd once called "emotions" long ago.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
17	300		304							Feeling in person the "selflessness" of Commandant's actions, I silenced my own rebukes.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
18	16		304							To be sure, my interactions with Commandant reawakened the emotions within me.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
19	17		304							For Constructs, emotions were part of the package. Being human once, we understood the meaning of the word, the value of it.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
20	18		304							But it was because of Commandant that I re-learned these emotions. To borrow a word frequently used among Constructs, I "rebooted".	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
21	19		304							The occasional gift, proffered without cause, taught me joy, something I had once neglected as tangential to the mission at hand.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1		1																	
22	20		304							Gradually, I learned that the gifts were not of reward, or compensation, but simply given.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
23	201		304							I felt my heart leap each time I received something from Commandant that, by all accounts, I did not own or deserve.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
24	21		304							Joy. That was what I felt. Receiving a gift always makes me feel like I owed Commandant something, to which the same answer always came.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
25	22		304							Just smile.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
26	23		304							It was... a difficult command to carry out.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
27	24		304							And then I learned of sadness as the accusations grew. I kept my cool as always, stopping myself from jumping to Commandant's defense.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
28	25		304							But wherever I turned, those whispers would still reach me and trigger undiagnosed processes in my M.I.N.D..	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
29	26		304							That was sadness. Not for myself, but for others, for Commandant, because I could not bear the slander against Commandant's name.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
30	27		304							So I kept my blade sharp, not for the prospect of showing my skill, but for the need to prove that of my Commandant's.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
31	28		304							And then, I learned the way Commandant thought, observed how tactics and strategy formed in Commandant's movements.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
32	29		304							Though our interactions will always be between human and machine, I still held to the hope that I can grow closer to Commandant, and become the best.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
33	30		304				AniZhuanchangBegin			—And thus, I learned anger.	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1			1

39	36		301							1	Lucia	What... what is this?	2																					
40	37		301									On one of Commandant's rest days, I was summoned to a training room by an unpaired team of Constructs. When I arrived, I saw that they had both their weapons and mine, along with a wager—with Commandant as the stakes.																						
41	38		301								Lucia	So if I lose, I hand over my commandant to you?	2																					
42	39		301								Construct	After all, we are fully staffed and ready to deploy, whereas with you, I'm afraid you'll never...	3

46	41		301								Construct	What?!	3																					
47	43		301									Without hesitation, I went on the offensive against the Constructs. In my mind, battle was joined the moment weapons were drawn.

58	50		202							3	2																							
59	52		301									I had no interest in contests of skill. Victories in training rooms mean little to nothing.																						
60	53		301									But not when Commandant was at stake.																						
61	54		301									In that moment, I realized with absolute clarity that I resented the idea of Commandant leaving me, and loathed the prospect of anyone placing stakes on our separation.																						
62	55		301									Because of that, I picked up the fallen Construct's blade, and charged for break in their formation.
