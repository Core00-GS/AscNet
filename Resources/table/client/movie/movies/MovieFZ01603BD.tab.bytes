4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Murray	...	1																					
5	5		301									Hiding in an inconspicuous corner on the streets, Murray is fiddling with his terminal and controlling the lure program in his guise.																						
6	6		301									Valeria and Yata are closing in on him, creeping to around ten meters behind.																						
7	7		301									An uncanny hint runs down Murray's spine. He stops controlling the terminal, and the lure program also stands frozen like a statue.																						
8	8		301									Murray turns around. Valeria and Yata walk out of the shadows from both of Murray's flanks.																						
9	9		301								Murray	Ah, as expected of Scarab. Faster than I thought.	1																					
10	10		301								Yata	Pah. Whatever you took from Gestalt, you're gonna spit it all out... piece by piece.																						
11	11		301								Valeria	Don't try anything funny.																						
12	12		301								Murray	And if I refuse?	1																					
13	13		301								Valeria	Then we'll be taking it from a dead body. Not much of a difference.																						
14	14		301								Murray	I see... So you've only been ordered to track and intercept, but not to eliminate.	1																					
15	15		301								Murray	Otherwise, I wouldn't even be standing here, would I? You don't want trouble unless things go south, yes?	1																					
16	16		301								Murray	Which means... we can strike a deal.	1																					
17	17		301									Yata remains unseen, but Murray can feel her appendages surrounding him. They remain at a slight distance, writhing around and checking.																						
18	18		301								Murray	Ahaha, you're learning... But it's okay, I've run out of welcome gifts.	1																					
19	19		204							1	1																							
20	20		301								Murray	Now then, back to the topic.	1																					
21	21		301									Murray spreads his hands. The terminal containing a whole host of data is laid bare before Valeria's eyes.																						
22	22		204							1																								
23	23		301								Murray	Do you know what's in this?	1																					
24	24		301								Valeria	I'm not interested. And if it makes you feel better, we're not afraid of "things going south."																						
25	25		301								Murray	...	1																					
26	26		301								Murray	I see. You're "not interested," which is why you ask no questions. For Commander Nikola, you'd indeed be a handier tool than me.	1																					
27	27		301								Murray	That must be why he said he approves of my capabilities... but still sent you here.	1																					
28	28		301								Murray	No... Or perhaps, he really does approve of me‚Äîthat's why he sent you here. If that's the case, my oh my, what an honor.	1																					
29	29		204							1	1																							
30	30		301									Murray's usual smile returns.																						
31	31		301								Murray	Well then, guess I better not disappoint him.	1																					
32	32		301								Yata	You done?																						
33	33		301								Valeria	You're a smart guy. Cooperating is in your best interest here.																						
34	34		301								Valeria	But... smart guys should remember to clear their access logs. Pity.																						
35	35		301									With that, Valeria motions to Yata. Her appendages immediately pierce through Murray's body.																						
36	36		301									But, he gives no reaction.																						
37	37		301								Murray	Surprise! The lure is the real one, and the real one is the lure.	1																					
38	38		301									The phantom Murray, now pierced by several appendages, is no longer moving, but voice is still coming out of his mouth.																						
39	39		301								Murray	Thank you for your cooperation.	1																					
40	40		301								Murray	And thank you for listening to my speech. That gave me enough time to unload the immersion program.	1																					
41	41		301								Murray	Quite a shame I don't get to see your expressions from the lure program, but I bet it'd make a stellar memory.	1																					
42	42		301									Blue streams of data begin to disperse from the "lure program" afar.																						
43	43		202							1					1																			
44	44		301								Yata	Dammit, V! Get him!																						
45	45		301								Valeria	On it.																						
46	46		301									Valeria leaps onto the street, rushing for the dissipating Murray.																						
47	47		301									But before her hand can reach Murray, he completely vanishes.																						
48	48		301								Yata	...****.																						
49	49		301									Yata spits out an elegant pejorative, and rips her appendages out from the wall behind the false Murray, now full of holes.																						
50	50		401							2	10007502																							
51	51		301			RImgBg1Shake						Almost instantaneously, the Murray explodes before her.																						
52	52		301								Valeria	Yata, what's happening?																						
53	53		301								Yata	Tch... It's a jamming smokescreen... Some dumb data weapon...																						
54	54		301								Valeria	...																						
55	55		401							2	1501																							
56	56		301								Valeria	What's going on?!																						
57	57		301								Yata	An area alarm... I see.																						
58	58		301								Valeria	So that's what he had planned...																						
59	59		301								Yata	That low-level smokescreen won't do much, but it's enough to alert the termination programs in this virtual space.																						
60	60		301								Yata	Tch, looks like they clean up everything with unknown IDs indiscriminately, which includes us.																						
61	61		301								Yata	Whatever it is, we can only... leave now.																						
62	62		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Valeria	Yeah.
