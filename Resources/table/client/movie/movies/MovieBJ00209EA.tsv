18	18		301									...That familiar binding sensation again.																						
19	19		301									No point in testing its strength. This collar is probably like the ones in the past: uncrackable, unless with authorization.																						
20	20		301								Pulao	...Now you just stay nice and still. If you move more than 2 meters away from me, the neurotoxin will be in you faster than you can say "ouch".	1																					
21	21		301								Pulao	...Judging from what the merchant told me, you'll rot from the inside out.	1

25	25		301								Pulao	Sorry... I do not want to go against you all.	1																					
26	26		301								Pulao	This is a backup data point designated by the boss. If I acquire the data, perhaps—	1																					
27	27		301								Bianca	That's no reason to hold 【kuroname】hostage!	2																					
28	28		301								Pulao	Once my pals on the Nighter get the data, we'll give you back your Commandant. You can take everything else that's left, if you want.	1																					
29	29		301								Pulao	We may not need much, but we do need our boss back.	1																					
30	30		302								There's no need for this, Pulao.	31																						
31	31		301								Pulao	【kuroname】... All that has happened was quite the coincidence, so I can't bring myself to trust you. If you're here for the boss' data... I have no choice but to go against you.	1

41	41		301									Lee raises his gun, pointing it straight at Pulao. Exactly what I was hoping he'd do.																						
42	42		301			RImgBg1Shake						Taking advantage of Pulao's moment of hesitation, I leap onto her, and the two of us roll together into the adjoining room. At the same time, I press the mouth of an anti-materiel pistol against the back of her head.

55	55		301								Lee	All the files are empty. I tried to restore the log and was only able to recover two entries.	1																					
56	56		301									Data log: Year ■, Day ■. Excerpt from audio monitor... Tsk, AI backup files, huh? Not even the real thing. No way they're more interesting than the secrets of Ascnet.

59	59		301									Behind the squad, the Corrupted begin to sway and crumble. As the Punishing Virus ravages their bodies, they gradually lose control and can barely hang on to their weapons.
