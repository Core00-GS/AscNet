5	5		301								Bruce	I'm always gentle.																						
6	6		301								Bruce	You should be grateful that I know how to treat wounds the old-fashioned way. You know the rules, we're not allowed to use the medical capsule.

16	16		301								Bruce	I'm sure he has his reasons, so stop complaining.

18	18		301								Watanabe	Yeah... Did you change your mind? Or are you still thinking of joining the Ground Forces to die on the front lines?																						
19	19		301								Bruce	I'm not going to die, I'm going so that fewer people die. Enough about me, what about you?																						
20	20		301								Watanabe	I'm going to be a mercenary once training ends. Will probably end up as a bodyguard of some rich people.																						
21	21		301								Bruce	Being wealthy and free, huh?
