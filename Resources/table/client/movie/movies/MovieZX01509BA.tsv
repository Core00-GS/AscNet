12	10		301								Bai Gui	You have yourself to blame for fighting with Cosmos Industries for three straight days and nights, Lianshan. Something like that is going down in history.	1

32	22		301								Heng Ji	It's a long way to go. This gadget can replace me in giving your periodic maintenance for your prosthesis.	1																					
33	23		301								Moyuan	Oh, it's this thing again.	2																					
34	24		301								Heng Ji	Don't worry. I've improved it. It won't burden your external humanoid brain any more. I've also reduced the power consumed by the nerve link with your prosthesis. It should perform better than last time.	1																					
35	25		301									Listening to Heng Ji, Moyuan tosses the micro bot into the air beside her. Surprisingly, it hovers in the air. A young mechanical doll with small hands firmly catches the device.																						
36	26		301								Moyuan	Alright, fine.	2																					
37	27		301									Moyuan reaches out and gently strokes the doll's hair. A moment later, the doll disappears with the gadget and hides nearby.

50	38		301								Moyuan	But there's one thing they haven't made public.	1																					
51	39		301								Moyuan	And that's the failure of the zero-point reactor experiment.	1																					
52	40		301								Moyuan	I've got a bad feeling about this...	1
