20	20		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						How long will it take until mankind completely disappears from the face of the Earth, and nature reclaims the cities?																						
21	21		301									During the prosperous Golden Age, people who kept progressing forward were no longer satisfied with dazzling new things and cutting-edge technology. While many were fascinated by reaching the stars, some people imagined a world without humans.																						
22	22		301									This post-apocalyptic fantasy had always been a popular topic for readers.																						
23	23		301									Vines climb the walls, tree roots peck through the asphalt, and rusty steel towers collapse in the wind and rain... Nature only needs a little sunshine and rain, and it will recapture this land at an amazing speed.																						
24	24		301									Trees take root, their branches strong. Grass sprouts, spreading like a blanket. The air smells of moist soil, like a pure land that has never been tread on.																						
25	25		301									But this picture, which is too peaceful, seems rather uncanny for the time.

31	31		301							1	Zack	Apparently not. It's over there.	1

34	34		301							1	"Beardy"	Oh... It's hard to see with so many trees here.	1

37	37		301			RImgBg1Shake						The group walks on the uneven forest floor, both feet never on the same plane. Right as they hear the sound of something being crushed, "Beardy" steps into a deep pit with his left foot.																						
38	38		301								"Beardy"	What the hell was that?!	1																					
39	39		301									"Beardy" hurriedly pulls his feet out of the soil. Looking down, he discovers that he stepped on a cracked, rusty iron plate. The paint on it had peeled off from the rust. Only the words "Pulia" and "Guide" are legible as well as a map that looked very large.																						
40	40		301									The place trampled by "Beardy" is located in the center of the map.

50	50		301									Zack looks carefully at the iron plate on the ground again, then points to the hole in the center of the map.																						
51	51		301								Zack	...Looks like the facilities are all built around the middle, which is most likely the location of the tower.	1

55	55		301								"Beardy"	So what? That means we'll have no problem getting to the filter!	1																					
56	56		301									"Beardy" doesn't seem to pay any mind. Instead, he raises his arms and laughs.																						
57	57		301								Kordes	We are looking for supplies, not to destroy things.	2																					
58	58		301								"Beardy"	I think it would be great if we can occupy the filter. After all, starting it should be easy with Zack here.	1

66	66		301									Looking away from the iron plate, Zack notices a tear in "Beardy's" pants. He must have cut it accidentally when he pulled his leg out of the hole.																						
67	67		301								Zack	Have a rest and check out supplies. We'll move out in 15 minutes.	1																					
68	68		301								Zack	Bandage your wound. Don't want you slowing us down when the tough gets going.	1																					
69	69		301								"Beardy"	Huh...?	2																					
70	70		301									"Beardy" looks at his lower leg and notices that he's bleeding, and curses out loud.

76	76		202							1					1																			
77	77		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After working for a short while, they finally set up a crude base camp. They clear a relatively flat patch of land and use a spare gas stove to light a simple bonfire.																						
78	78		401							2	1511																							
79	79		301									Zack loads shells into his shotgun and quietly inventories the ammunition on him.																						
80	80		301									After Kordes tends to "Beardy's" wound, he sits down beside him and fiddles with a plant by his foot as if lost in thought.																						
81	81		301									Rolmo appears to be nervous, but after seeing that no one is paying attention to him, he just sits quietly beside the campfire.																						
82	82		301									Zack just looks at him calmly, closes his eyes and takes a nap.																						
83	83		301									Perhaps it was because Rolmo had kept himself busy the entire time looking for supplies, leading the way, helping them avoid areas with hidden danger several times. Either way, the trio seems to have grown accustomed to him. They even appear to have let down their guard around him.																						
84	84		301									"Beardy" adjusts his bandage, then pulls out half a hardtack and throws it to Rolmo.

89	89		301								Rolmo	...Thanks.	1																					
90	90		202							1	2				1																			
91	91		301									Accustomed to seeing decadent cities, the green forest reinvigorates the weary travelers. Their destination is near. For a moment, they lower their guard slightly and enjoy a short respite during their perilous journey.

93	93		301							1	Zack	(Whistles)	1																					
94	94		301									The dry whistle echoes in the forest. It seems to be an old tune. Rolmo looks up at Zack while he whistles. There's a peculiar twinkle in his eyes.																						
95	95		301								Zack	This place reminds me of a movie I saw a long time ago. There's a scene really similar to this forest.	1

97	97		201							2	500140		-400																					
98	98		301							1	"Beardy"	What movie?	2																					
99	99		301								Zack	In a world of never-ending wars and disasters, a young man volunteers on a journey to the tower at the edge of the world in search of a secret treasure that can end the war, thus completing his trial to become a knight.	1																					
100	100		301								Zack	In one scene, the main character arrives at a dark and gloomy forest where he is surrounded by monsters. He fights them for 7 days before finally breaking free, only to find out that the monsters were really... Uh, what was it again? Oh, it was the "loss and weakness" he felt in his heart.	1																					
101	101		301									The leader of the Scavengers, who was a man of few words along the way, opens up a little and shows a rare expression of enthusiasm as he talks about the movie.																						
102	102		301								"Beardy"	Who'da thought you had an eye for the arts, Zack. I sure didn't. I'm surprised you even remember anything about it.	2																					
103	103		301								Zack	The monsters in it were pretty cool.	1																					
104	104		301								"Beardy"	Sounds like a B movie. How'd it end?	2																					
105	105		301								Zack	After an agonizing struggle, the main character finally reaches the top of the tower, but there's no secret treasure. It was all in vain.	1																					
106	106		301								Zack	I didn't have time to finish it, but it was toward the end. I just remember the main character falling on one knee in the tower after realizing there was nothing in there...	1																					
107	107		301									Zack stands up and imitates the protagonist kneeling down with his sword according to his memory.

116	116		301								"Beardy"	That line sounds cringy. Seems like a garbage movie.	2

118	118		201							1	500136																							
119	119		301							1	Zack	Garbage? I don't think so. The monsters were pretty bad***, and the main character's acting was on point.	1																					
120	120		301								Zack	He looked pretty young, but he was already staring in a movie.	1																					
121	121		301								Zack	Apparently, he won the award for best actor and was signed by a famous entertainment company from the Golden Age. What was it called again—Rocko?	1

125	125		301								Zack	...There's a lot you can't imagine.	1																					
126	126		301								Zack	...The ending was pretty bland, but it's a pretty decent memory in hindsight. Now, this kind of entertainment is a luxury.	1																					
127	127		301								Kordes	That's one of the privileges of living in a time of peace. Movies seem lame, but they're a symbol of a happy life and the freedom to have fun whenever you want.	2

134	134		202							1	2				1																			
135	135		301									What is the standard of happiness for people in the Golden Age?																						
136	136		301									Was it having enough food, warm clothes, a job that can support you, and a home that awaits your return?																						
137	137		301									For Scavengers, these are unreachable hopes.																						
138	138		201							1	500136																							
139	139		301							1	Zack	Well, it's no use thinking about it now. We can't even say for sure if we'll survive.	1

144	144		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Under the guidance of Rolmo, the Scavengers see the gray steel building get closer and closer.																						
145	145		301									As they proceed deeper into the forest, Kordes notices some subtle changes in the forest.																						
146	146		301									The strange sound from the depths, the crackling sound of dead branches breaking, and the increasingly obvious scarlet light emitting from the plants.																						
147	147		301									Originally, he thought it was red berries or leaves, until he accidentally broke a branch when he passed a narrow path.																						
148	148		301									Red viscous liquid flows out from the bark and drips on the grass.																						
149	149		201							1	500139		400																					
150	150		201							2	500140		-400																					
151	151		301							1	Kordes	The Punishing Virus...	1																					
152	152		301								"Beardy"	What was that?	2																					
153	153		301								Kordes	Something's wrong with these plants. They seem to be infected with the Punishing Virus... Sap shouldn't be this color—even for the red leaves.	1																					
154	154		301								"Beardy"	Enough with the botany lesson. You mean these trees are infected? But the Punishing concentration here is low.	2																					
155	155		301									With that, "Beardy" reaches out to break the nearest branch.																						
156	156		301								Kordes	Don't! Destroying the plants might cause the concentration to rise!	1																					
157	157		301								"Beardy"	Alright, alright. Keep it down!	2																					
158	158		301								Kordes	Just looking at the plants, you can see that they're no ordinary plants. They seem to be extending in this direction.	1																					
159	159		301									With that, Kordes pushes aside the wild bushes and follows the red plants deep into the forest.																						
160	160		301								Kordes	It's reasonable to assume that these plants aren't affected by the Punishing Virus. There must be a reason for this mutation...	1																					
161	161		301								"Beardy"	Hey... Slow down!	2

168	168		401							2	51																							
169	169		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After passing through the lush overgrowth, he sees a completely different scene from the forest behind him.																						
170	170		301									Scarlet crevasses are covered with green plants. Interspersed among them, he sees dazzling red vegetation and deformed humanoid creatures crawling within it.																						
171	171		301									The humanoid creatures crawl on their four legs, which are constantly changing shape. The rattling from the menacing bone spurs on their limbs echoes through the forest.																						
172	172		301									For a moment, Kordes thinks that he has stumbled into Hell. The weird and twisted creatures in front of him are like souls burning in hellfire. But as "Beardy" grabs him tightly, he slowly comes to his senses.																						
173	173		201							1	500140																							
174	174		301							1	"Beardy"	Holy ****... What are those things?!	1																					
175	175		202							1	2				1																			
176	176		301									"Beardy's" voice is distorted out of fear. His sudden outburst causes the unaware "creatures" to notice him.																						
177	177		301									One of the "creatures" tilts its head, then begins to slowly crawl toward the Scavenger. A peculiar red cord the thickness of a woman's forearm trails behind it, wriggling like entrails or an umbilical cord. Its "chest" is connected to one end in which a red sphere beats wildly.																						
178	178		301									The "creature's" head lacking any facial features slowly turns to the human in front of it, as if "observing" him.																						
179	179		301									It lifts up its forelegs and stands up, then waddles toward the Scavenger like an infant.																						
180	180		401							2	571																							
181	181		301									Inspired by the first "creature" to stand up, the other "creatures" crawling on the ground stand up in a twisted manner. Dozens of pale creatures in the forest stand up and turn to face the Scavengers. Their bloody umbilical cords drag on the ground with a sticky, oozy sound.																						
182	182		402							571																								
183	183		301									Finally processing what he is witnessing, the only emotion that occupies the forefront of the Scavenger's mind is "fear."																						
184	184		201							1	500139																							
185	185		301							1	Kordes	Ah... AH!	1																					
186	186		202							1	2				1																			
187	187		301									As they get within close-range, the pale skin of the "creature's" face begins to peel back, followed by the dark red flesh underneath, revealing a cavity in its skull. Two rows of firm white spurs grow along both edges of the cavity, like a poor imitation of human teeth.																						
188	188		301								???	Ah... AH...?																						
189	189		301									Almost exactly like Kordes, the "creature" wails from within its round cavity. While mechanically repeating the scream, it puts its two hands in front of his chest, one higher than the other.																						
190	190		301									It is the same posture as Kordes with his gun drawn.																						
191	191		401							2	1510																							
192	192		301									But the posture lasts less than a second only to be disrupted by a barrage of gunfire. The "creature" staggers back a step, then slowly tries to lift up its arm, which has been blown off.																						
193	193		201							1	500136																							
194	194		301							1	Zack	What are you doing just standing there?!	1

197	197		202							1					1																			
198	198		301			RImgBg1Shake						Zack's yell causes "Beardy" to suddenly wake up from the nightmare. Pushing Kordes away, the gun in his hand unleashes a fierce burst of flame. The gunfire blasts the creature right in its head and chest.																						
199	199		301								???	What... Ah... Rgh... You doing... Rargh... Standing?? There... Argh...																						
200	200		301									Even on the verge of collapse, the creature continues to mimic them like a mirror trying to replicate human behavior. The horrific sight causes "Beardy's" hair to stand on end.																						
201	201		201							1	500140																							
202	202		301							1	"Beardy"	W-why won't it stop?!	1																					
203	203		401							2	10001004																							
204	204		301			RImgBg1Shake						"Beardy" raises his gun to shoot the "creature" with an even larger barrage. The exposed red sphere breaks and splatters, sending scarlet blood mist into the air.																						
205	205		301									The Scavengers' bare skin begins to fester due to infection. White ribs begin to grow outside the broken red heart of the "creature."																						
206	206		201							1	500139																							
207	207		301							1	Kordes	The Punishing Virus... Just like those monsters growing in the Red Tide... They're all viruses...	1
