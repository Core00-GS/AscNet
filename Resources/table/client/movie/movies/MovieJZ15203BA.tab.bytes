7	7		301							1	Villier	You made it. Looks like the press conference is over.	2																					
8	8		301								Qu	Looks like it. Without the stars of the show that is...	1																					
9	9		301								Villier	You know I'm bad with the press. You're a natural though.	2																					
10	10		301								Qu	But you're key to revolutionizing the Musashi series.	1																					
11	11		301								Villier	That being said, I'd rather be in the company of machinery than be surrounded by a group of businessmen and politicians.	2																					
12	12		301								Villier	I don't have to deal with awful human emotions when I'm with my machines.	2																					
13	13		301								Villier	A perfect creation like that is only suitable for people like you and me.	2																					
14	14		301								Villier	Sorry, getting ahead of myself...	2

19	19		301							1	Villier	Now that the press conference is over, let's move on to our next destination.	2																					
20	20		301								Villier	The family transport craft will arrive here in about 20 minutes.	2																					
21	21		301								Qu	Alright, but didn't you turn off that machine?	1																					
22	22		301								Villier	What machine? I was just sitting here reading. I didn't touch any machine.	2																					
23	23		301								Qu	...	1

26	26		301									Just as Villier is lost in confusion, Qu kicks a screwdriver on the floor straight at him.																						
27	27		301									Villier barely reacts in time just as he turns to dodge the attack. The screwdriver brushes his cheek as it flies past. Turning his head, he sees that one of the exhibits has somehow entered attack mode.																						
28	28		301									Musashi VI picks up the cannon and swings it at Villier standing in front of it.

32	32		301									Qu's attack offsets Musashi VI's swing, allowing Villier to jump over to her side before the next attack arrives.

38	38		301								Villier	No, doesn't look like it. Let's take it out first. This isn't worthy of being called my creation.	1																					
39	39		301								Qu	Yup.	2
