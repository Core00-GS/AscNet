4	4		301			DialogEnable						Dear Miss Meka,																						
5	5		301									When you see this letter, I'm already on my way to WGAA.																						
6	6		301									Finally, I have found my path, one that may separate me from a lot of things.																						
7	7		301									Sorry about the decision I made.																						
8	8		301									But I didn't want to become a Construct out of impulse...																						
9	9		301									I have always been painting with vivid, brilliant colors. Many people loved my work, and I was delighted.																						
10	10		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					I couldn't understand why Selena wanted to become a Construct. But...

12	12		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						I have seen things you wouldn't believe. I watched pink beams fired from plasma cannons glitter in the eternal sky outside portholes.																						
13	13		301									Dark red missiles exploded next to shuttles that just left the space anchor.																						
14	14		301									The fighter aircraft's armor melted like Selena's pudding with bubbles and red-hot light.																						
15	15		301									I have finally found my path.																						
16	16		301									What I used to paint... wasn't the "reality".																						
17	17		301									Those works are like genetically engineered flowers that grow in a cleanroom. Once the cover is taken away, they wither and die.																						
18	18		301									Compared with the eternal reality, those things I once enjoyed portraying look so meaningless.																						
19	19		301									I finally understand...																						
20	20		301									I need the power because I have come to realize how cruel the world is.																						
21	21		301									An ordinary person is far too fragile against the Punishing Virus, let alone discovering the truth.																						
22	22		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					It's time to create... real work.

50	50		301								Ayla	Come, show me what "reality" is.																						
51	51		301									A coolant pipe is cut open somewhere. Gray liquid keep dripping from above.																						
52	52		301									Only to make a hissing sound when it reaches the blazing blade of Ayla's scythe.																						
53	53		301								Ayla	Selena, I can feel you. Your decisions, your feelings.																						
54	54		301								Ayla	You were able to recreate the last act of "Tempest" because you had always been facing this cruel world.																						
55	55		301								Ayla	And I'm fighting now, just like you... And it feels as thought you're right here by my side.																						
56	56		301								Ayla	So, wait for me...																						
57	57		301								Ayla	I don't know how long it will take, but I promise I will find you again. We will stand together, side by side.																						
58	58		301								Ayla	We will be the best partners. Be it in art or on the battlefield...!																						
59	59		301								Ayla	Feel it!																						
60	60		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Ayla	Feel this power that stemmed from creation! Not for attention, not for the audience. A power that only comes after witnessing the truth...!
