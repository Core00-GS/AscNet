10	10		201							1	500319																							
11	11		301							1	Collins	What do you say, Karen? This frame is doing alright, isn't it?	1																					
12	12		301									Karenina gives Collins a sidelong glance, loathing to answer the man walking toward her with his arms extended.

14	14		201							2	500494	12	400																					
15	15		301							1	Karenina	It's you again... You certainly look like you've got nothing to do.	2																					
16	16		301								Collins	Ah, my looks can be deceiving. You have no idea how much I care about this frame's performance.	1																					
17	17		301								Karenina	I don't know how you did it, but it certainly performs better than other regular models...	2																					
18	18		301								Collins	Construct Tech hasn't stopped advancing, after all. The field has been expanding like bread dough rising ever since your grandfather Dr. Kalon established its foundation.	1																					
19	19		204							2	7																							
20	20		301									Karenina is surprised to hear her grandfather's name from Collins.																						
21	21		204							2	4																							
22	22		301								Karenina	...Hey, do you know Grandpa?	2																					
23	23		301									Karenina's grandfather never told her about his past. She only learned about some of it through various documents and files.																						
24	24		301									But she has a feeling that some key information has been scraped from each of these files as if someone has been intentionally hiding Kalon's past.																						
25	25		301								Collins	So Dr. Kalon didn't tell his granddaughter anything for real. What a madman! Wasting that genius brain of his...	1																					
26	26		301									Everyone in the slums where Karenina grew up treated the oddly-behaving Kalon as a madman, but he never seemed to mind.																						
27	27		301								Collins	"Don't forget the value of life"—I also heard him say that quite a lot. As a researcher of the Construct experiment, he was certainly an odd fella even before he went cuckoo.	1																					
28	28		204							1	14																							
29	29		301								Collins	But that was precisely why he was one of the few people I respected... How nice it'd be if he were still with us.	1																					
30	30		301									Collins looks like he is about to cry before suddenly smacking his forehead excitedly as if he has recalled something.																						
31	31		204							1																								
32	32		301								Collins	Right! Let me show you Dr. Kalon's lab.	1																					
33	33		201							2	500499	7	400																					
34	34		301							1	Yarha	Mr. Collins...! The lab...	2																					
35	35		204							2																								
36	36		301									Collins waves his hand and stops Yarha from continuing.																						
37	37		201							2	500494	7	400																					
38	38		301							1	Karenina	Grandpa... was here on the lunar base?	2																					
39	39		301								Collins	Haha! Rather, over half of this lunar base was built for Dr. Kalon and his Construct experiments.	1

42	42		301							1		Liszt quietly reminds Collins how dangerous he is acting.																						
43	43		301								Liszt	Are you sure about telling them our biggest secret...? This can mess up all of our plans.	2																					
44	44		301								Collins	It's fine. The cat would be out of the bag sooner or later if our wish were to come true. If they can help us unlock that mysterious "treasure trove" quicker, nothing else matters.	1																					
45	45		202							1	2																							
46	46		401							2	1516																							
47	47		301									Collins starts moving without waiting for anyone. Karenina hesitates for one second before deciding to follow, only to find Teddy holding onto her wrist.																						
48	48		201							1	500495		400																					
49	49		201							2	500494	12	-400																					
50	50		301							1	Teddy	Hey... Don't you find these people suspicious?	1																					
51	51		204							2	4																							
52	52		301								Karenina	Suspicious as hell. But... I think it's true that they know something about Grandpa that even Babylonia doesn't know.	2																					
53	53		301								Karenina	Not that I care about his past, but I guess I couldn't stay away from any opportunity to know more about him... He was my only family, after all. I don't expect a rich girl from a big family like you to understand.	2																					
54	54		204							1	14																							
55	55		301								Teddy	Family... Forget it. I'll come with you.	1																					
56	56		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Teddy shakes her head and follows Collins alongside Karenina.

59	59		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Collins leads the two of them through several security checkpoints under careful inspection. Each checkpoint is guarded by a few Construct soldiers without squad designation.																						
60	60		201							1	500494	12																						
61	61		301							1	Karenina	That's a lot of guards for one laboratory...	1																					
62	62		201							1	500319																							
63	63		301							1	Collins	Haha... Well, we have a baby angel in there we can't afford to let loose—not that these folks can do much if she does intend to go.	1																					
64	64		401							2	647																							
65	65		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Collins does not explain further. After going through the last checkpoint, he opens the door to the Construct Laboratory.

71	71		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The dark environment almost devours whatever light comes through the door from the outside, leaving the ghostly blue light emitted by the device in the center of the room the only thing glowing.																						
72	72		301								Teddy	Hey, isn't that the Omega Prototype we made...																						
73	73		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					It is the Mega-Omega Weapon, requiring the zero-point reactor to keep running. Several times the size of its original design, it was built to test and observe the practicality of the Omega Weapon.

76	76		401							1	50																							
77	77		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						But as the blue light flashes, they see a pale, young girl inside—bounded, she looks to be at peace as if she is sleeping.																						
78	78		301									She is the first Ascendant humans know about, the culprit of Babylonia's near-fall, and the first Ascendant to approach humans directly.																						
79	79		301								Karenina	Luna...!																						
80	80		301									Almost instinctively, Karenina takes out her weapon and aims at Luna, but she is surprised to find all the guarding Construct soldiers pointing their guns at her.																						
81	81		301								Karenina	What... what are you doing?! Do you know what that is?!																						
82	82		301								Collins	Of course... Everything here is built for her.																						
83	83		301									Collins casually gestures to the surrounding soldiers to lower their arms before stepping toward Luna, standing before her under the blue light, watching the girl with delight.																						
84	84		301								Karenina	Bull****! Get out of my way! She's an Ascendant... An enemy to all of humankind!																						
85	85		301								Collins	Sure, Ascendants can take lives. The Punishing Virus she wields can take lives.																						
86	86		301									Collins grins and turns around, staring at Karenina fearlessly.																						
87	87		301								Collins	But Constructs can also take lives, and so can that hammer you wield.																						
88	88		301								Collins	Ascendants aren't necessarily humanity's enemies, unlike "being weak"... Isn't that why we armed ourselves with science, changing the world?																						
89	89		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Collins	When the day we unlock the secrets of the Ascendants comes, granting us the power of the Ascension-Network, those beings that once threatened humanity's existence will turn into the light that guides our evolution.

91	91		401							1	112																							
92	92		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Collins flicks his hand, and all the lights in the laboratory focus on where he stands.																						
93	93		201							1	500319																							
94	94		301							1	Collins	Like how it witnessed the development of Constructs... this... Moon... will witness the second time humanity evolves—the moment we become Ascendants.	1																					
95	95		201							1	500494	5																						
96	96		301							1	Karenina	Turning humans into Ascendants?! Did you hurt your head...?	1																					
97	97		201							1	500319																							
98	98		301							1	Collins	I was there when "Luna" was born. I know what happened in City 075—what she did was akin to sacrificing herself. Doesn't that prove that humans and Ascendants aren't really that different?	1																					
99	99		301								Collins	Eternal life, unlimited power... We don't need to fear the Punishing Virus anymore! It will be ours to command...	1																					
100	100		301								Collins	Of course, that's the ideal outcome. Right now, all we can do is use this Mega-Omega Weapon as insurance when we awake Luna and ask her about what we couldn't find with technological means—the secrets of the Ascnet.	1																					
101	101		301									Collins might be mad, but he is not a fool. His grandiose vision is not built on a shaky foundation.																						
102	102		201							1	500494	4																						
103	103		301							1	Karenina	Even if Luna wants to escape, this cage can absorb the Punishing Virus to cripple or even kill her... But without zero-point energy, this cage is nothing but a pretty vase.	1																					
104	104		201							1	500495	5																						
105	105		301							1	Teddy	That's why you need us to restart the zero-point reactor. Clearly... that is what you're truly after. But there's no way the Parliament would approve it. Who the hell are you guys?	1																					
106	106		201							1	500319																							
107	107		301							1		Collins laughs wildly, slowly walking toward the center of the laboratory.																						
108	108		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Collins	Hahahaha! We're the oldest madmen in human history. You might have heard of the name we use to call ourselves—Kurono.	1
