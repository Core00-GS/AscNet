8	8		301									The homesick tune has come to its end as if the muffled sound of a horn. It brightens up the mood and lifts the spirits of the night watchers.																						
9	9		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					It doesn't seem right for the sea to remain this calm. Looking into the distance, memories of the past come pouring into mind. The sailor starts sharing his story.

13	13		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The evil dragon itself might not be the calamity, but it certainly represents calamity.																						
14	14		301									And it's not just the dragon... Monsters, war, disease, hunger... As the mix of these things ages, it brings suffering and pain. This world is strangling and suffocating everyone.																						
15	15		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					None of these makes any sense.

17	17		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Sailor	People want to survive.																						
18	18		301									Many people abandoned their homes and escaped from their previous lives. They ended up getting separated from the others and dying alone.																						
19	19		301								Sailor	Then, people realized another thing about that evil dragon. It was a lot less likely to get attacked by the dragon or the monsters while at sea than it was while on land.																						
20	20		301								Sailor	Many people started building boats or even taking other people's boats for their own.																						
21	21		301								Sailor	One by one, the boats set sail for the uncharted sea. People scrambled to get a ticket on such lifeboats. They pushed each other away, dragged each other down, and stepped on each other's bodies to desperately grasp at straws.																						
22	22		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Sailor	Back then, I was young and physically strong. But there were so many people. Too many people, actually. The jostling crowd was more like pushing each other off the board rather than helping each other board the boat.																						
23	23		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory537.jpg																								
24	24		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						People were pushing each other and tightening their bellies as if they wanted to squeeze the air out of their lungs so they could fit in the boat and save space for more refugees.																						
25	25		301								Sailor	The boarding plank was ravaged by the many people stomping it. And I was slowly losing my strength. In the end, I came up with a silly idea.																						
26	26		301									The sailor looks down at his slightly crippled leg. There is a faint smile on his face as if he just thought of something funny.																						
27	27		301								Sailor	Though the idea was silly, it was also effective. I put my leg into the damaged plank that could no longer hold people's weight.																						
28	28		301								Sailor	It was painful at first as I could feel the wood splinter nailed into my leg and even the bones. My ankle was completely stuck there.																						
29	29		301								Sailor	It was really painful for both my leg and my belly. Even breathing became a torment. While I was in a daze, I tried to distract myself with something. So, I focused on my hearing.																						
30	30		301								Sailor	It was strange. I couldn't hear anything. Everyone seemed to be angry, yelling, or crying, but I couldn't hear a thing. My mouth was moving, but I didn't realize what I said. Perhaps I didn't say anything. I couldn't hear it anyway.																						
31	31		301									But it didn't matter. After all, I only cared about one thing back then:																						
32	32		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					I must stay on the boat.
