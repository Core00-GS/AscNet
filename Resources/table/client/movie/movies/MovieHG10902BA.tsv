6	6		302								Yes, I am.	7																						
7	7		301								Agent	I am Ayla's agent.	1																					
8	8		301								Agent	Of course, that's neither here nor there. Thanks to you, Ayla's been making a fuss about her installation...	1																					
9	9		302								???	10																						
10	10		301								Agent	...I think it'd be best for you to come here.	1

16	16		301									Ayla's filled her room will sorts of "blocks" yesterday...																						
17	17		301									Ayla has been working non-stop carving blocks, and empty cans of energy drinks are all over the place.

19	19		301							1	Agent	You made it.	1																					
20	20		301								Agent	Are you the commandant that solved Ayla's "puzzle"?	1																					
21	21		302								Um, you mean...	22																						
22	22		301								Agent	...	1																					
23	23		301								Agent	The most annoying thing for an artist is unveiling their artwork before it's ready.	1																					
24	24		301								Agent	If their "puzzle" is solved too early, the artist will have one of two thoughtsâ€”	1																					
25	25		301								Agent	Either they will think they are stupid, or that the viewer is too smart.	1																					
26	26		301								Agent	So, in order to prove that they aren't stupid, they become almost... paranoid in their attempt to design a new "puzzle."	1

29	29		301							1	Ayla	What are you going on about...	2																					
30	30		301								Ayla	Oh? It's you. What brings you here?	2																					
31	31		301								Agent	Those are the only two possible explanations as to why you've been up all night working.	1																					
32	32		301								Agent	Whoever did this to you is responsible for fixing it. As for who, all I had to do was look at the system records.	1																					
33	33		301								Ayla	Really?	2																					
34	34		301								Agent	...You've really outdone yourself this time.	1																					
35	35		301								Ayla	I just think I can come up with a better puzzle is all.	2																					
36	36		301								Agent	If you want practical feedback, wouldn't it be better to get advice rather than bury yourself in your work?	1																					
37	37		301								Agent	"If you want your voice to be heard, then you have to let others hear it."	1																					
38	38		301								Agent	By the way, the person in charge of the art exhibition asked me to tell you that your piece will have to until the next exhibition.	1																					
39	39		301								Agent	But I suggest that you go today...	1																					
40	40		301								Agent	Looking at other artists' works might give you some inspiration.	1

44	44		201							2	500114																							
45	45		301								Agent	But as your agent, this is all the advice I can give you now.	2																					
46	46		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Agent	As for how to frame the "question," that is left to the creator... That's what a former member of the WGAA once said.	2
