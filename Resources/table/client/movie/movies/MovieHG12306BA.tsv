3	3		301			DialogEnable						Sharp pain erupts from your ear drums, while a chaotic dissonance rings in your ears.																						
4	4		301									The sounds around you are muffled as though you are under water.																						
5	5		301									The flash grenade the Corrupted threw may not have caused any fatal damage, but getting caught in it at such a close distance does leave you temporarily blind.																						
6	6		301									You feel unspeakable pain in your eyes. You are unable to open them even in the presence of dim light. This is not good. You may fall into greater danger if your vision does not return soon.																						
7	7		301									You reach for your memory and swiftly navigate over to the corner between the steel door and wall. You sit on the ground and start performing first aid on your arm that was scraped by a steel fragment during the explosion.																						
8	8		301									Your left glove is no longer protective, as blood soaks your glove and fingers, hindering movement instead.																						
9	9		301									You unclasp the buckle for your arm, remove the glove and throw it to your side. Feeling for your portable radar detector, you flip on the switch. Fortunately, it is still functioning.																						
10	10		301									At least now, when something approaches you, you'll be notified by your radar.																						
11	11		301									The radar starts to sound as soon as you switch it on.																						
12	12		301								???	Found you.

16	16		301									You see a black shadow inching closer in your blurred vision.																						
17	17		301									The pain in your eyes is still grating on your nerves. Opening them for those few seconds is already your limit. So you can only rely on your intuition to point your gun toward the shadow.																						
18	18		301								???	How pathetic. This is a rare sight indeed. The Gray Raven Commandant, powerless in front of me.																						
19	19		301									The shadow is looking down at you. Although you cannot hear clearly what they are saying, the voice does sound very familiar.																						
20	20		302								Stay back!	21	I'll shoot!	21																				
21	21		301								???	How rude.																						
22	22		301								???	Do your teammates know about this side of you?																						
23	23		302								...	24																						
24	24		301								???	...You can't hear me. Sigh, if you don't properly treat your wounds, it'll cause permanent hearing damage.																						
25	25		301								???	Come on, let's get out of here first.																						
26	26		301									The person lifts you up and leads you toward a certain direction step by step.																						
27	27		302								Who are you?	28	Let go of me.	29																				
28	28	32	301								???	I'm your partner in prison break, did you forget about me already?																						
29	29		301								???	Fine.																						
30	30		301								???	The person let go of your arm without protest.																						
31	31		401							1	201																							
32	32		301									The tinnitus in your ears eases up a bit. You can finally identify the sounds you hear.																						
33	33		301									The person speaking seems to be masking his voice with a modulator as you hear a low and weird voice.																						
34	34		301									Why is he... changing his voice?																						
35	35		301								???	The Corrupted are coming. We'll need to break through here together. Unfortunately, my weapon was destroyed, so I'll need your help to get rid of these pesky enemies.																						
36	36		302								How?	37																						
37	37		301								???	I'll be your eyes, you just need to aim and shoot.																						
38	38		301									The person lifts your hand that is gripping the gun.																						
39	39		301								???	Ready?																						
40	40		302								(Raise gun)	41																						
41	41		301									The radar goes off frantically as several unidentified individuals close in on the two of you. You do not reply with your words but with your actions.																						
42	42		301								???	On your right.																						
43	43		302								(Fire)	44																						
44	44		401							2	662																							
45	45		301								???	Your 1 o'clock, raise your arm.																						
46	46		302								(Fire)	47																						
47	47		401							2	662																							
48	48		301								???	4 o'clock... There're two. Aim the second shot at 45 degrees to the side, diagonally.																						
49	49		302								(Fire)	50																						
50	50		401							2	662																							
51	51		401					200		2	662																							
52	52		301									Gripping your gun, you pull the trigger according to the instructions of the person next to you. He supports your hand while slightly adjusting the angle when you shoot.																						
53	53		401							2	662																							
54	54		401					200		2	662																							
55	55		301									As you've never shot before while being temporarily blind, sweat begins to form on your forehead, but the arm supporting yours never wavers.																						
56	56		301									Although you have no idea who he is, in this moment, you decide to trust his guidance.																						
57	57		401							2	662																							
58	58		301									After the last shot, all noisy mechanic clamoring stops. Your arm starts to feel numb after so many continuous shots.																						
59	59		301								???	I didn't know you were such a sharp shooter even when blinded.																						
60	60		302								I'm in the army.	61	I've had training of this kind.	62																				
61	61	63	301								???	I know.																						
62	62		301								???	Training for a situation like this... How reliable.																						
63	63		302								Who are you?	64																						
64	64		301									You ask this question once more.																						
65	65		301									A name tugs at your mind, but you don't have concrete proof.																						
66	66		302								Your voice is familiar.	67	Your voice sounds like one of my mission's target.	67																				
67	67		301								???	...Oh my.																						
68	68		301									After that, the other person does not speak anymore. No matter how much you try to engage in a conversation, he stays silent.																						
69	69		302								...	70																						
70	70		302								Well, in any case, thank you.	71																						
71	71		301									The silent figure next to you lets out a laugh, as if to remind you that your choice to trust in him blindly is not wise.

79	79		301									You remember what he said before.																						
80	80		302								You could've just left me there.	81																						
81	81		302								But you didn't.	82																						
82	82		302								So...	83																						
83	83		302								I think I can trust you.	84																						
84	84		301									The person next to you interrupts what you were about to say. He pulls up your left hand with a force that is not so strong yet you can't defy.																						
85	85		301									It tickles in the palm of your hand, if though someone is writing on it.																						
86	86		301									You. Are. Welcome.																						
87	87		301									You subconsciously read aloud the words written on your palm.																						
88	88		301									Till. Next. Time.																						
89	89		301									He lets go of your hand and the ticklish feeling is gone.																						
90	90		301									Exhaustion hits you like a bus, all the wounds on your body fight for your attention all at once. The hand supporting you is strong yet cold. When you finally notice, you are already placed in a relatively safe corner.																						
91	91		301									The mysterious person has long since left. There were no sounds of footsteps when he did, as though he was never here at all.																						
92	92		301									The only thing that proves that he wasn't a figment of your imagination is the terminal in your hand.																						
93	93		301									You don't know if there will come a day when the messages are refreshed, or if you will ever get to meet the mysterious person again.																						
94	94		301									As you contemplate, you hear the roaring sounds of vehicles from the outside. It is probably backup from Babylonia.																						
95	95		301									You put the terminal in your pocket and stand up while supporting yourself on the wall.																						
96	96		301									Though you have a feeling the two of you will meet again, maybe as enemies.																						
97	97		301									But when the time comes...
