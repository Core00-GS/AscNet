4	5		301			DialogEnable				1	Celica	Perfect timing, 【kuroname】. Could you help me with something?	1																					
5	100		302								What thing?	6	Of course.	7																				
6	6	8	301								Celica	Just something simple. If you're not saying yes or no out loud, then I'll take it as a yes!	1																					
7	7	8	301								Celica	Huzzah, I knew you'd say yes!	1																					
8	8		301									Before you utter a single clarifying question, Celica pushes the towering stack of documents on her desk over to you.																						
9	9		301								Celica	There's quite a stack of files here, and it's all piled kinda haphazardly, so you'll have to watch where you're going!	1																					
10	10		301								Celica	I just need these delivered to R&D Section 2, okay? Okay, Gray Raven—green to deploy!	1																					
11	101		302								...The light is green.	11	Can't you deliver them yourself?	12																				
12	11	102	301								Celica	Yep! That's the way to do it!	1																					
13	12	102	301								Celica	I'm rushing to prepare the documents for the next Council meeting, but these are urgent too. So please, and thank you!	1

17	13		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Somewhere near R&D Section 2																						
18	14		301									You see the entrance to Section 2 at the end of the hallway. You know that it answers directly to the Science Council and handles Babylonia's operations from propulsion systems to even menial repairs.																						
19	15		301			RImgBg1Shake						...!																						
20	6844		401							1	102																							
21	16		301									The closer you get to the entrance, the stronger you feel that something horribly wrong is happening.																						
22	8942		401							2	10007502																							
23	17		301									While not deafening, the explosions still send small shockwaves nearby. Wisps of smoke trail from the entrance, just faint enough to slip past the notice of the fire alarms. You have a bad feeling about this.																						
24	18		301			RImgBg1Shake					???	Whoa!																						
25	19		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Then you hear a cry from inside the room, though you are unsure if it was one in shock or in need of help. Whatever it is, you set down the stack of documents and run in.

28	20		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Lucia	Cough cough... cough... Hey, Commandant, what brings you down here?	1																					
29	106		302								I'd sooner ask you that question.	21	What happened here?	22																				
30	21	23	301								Lucia	Um... I was just trying to cook here.	1																					
31	22	23	301								Lucia	Oh... you mean that little accident... and the smoke? I was just cooking.	1																					
32	23		301									Entering the room, you are confronted with a scene of utter chaos. Utensils and containers are scattered all over the floor and the tables, while black marks decorate the unlikeliest of places.																						
33	24		301									Lucia barely pays the carnage any mind. Calmly, she collects the damaged utensils, organizes them, then deposits them in the garbage disposal.																						
34	544		401							1	208																							
35	25		301								Lucia	But... as to "why" I'm cooking, that's simple. This is part of my re-acclimatization process.	1																					
36	107		204							1	1																							
37	26		301								Lucia	I never was good at cooking. That's something I would like to change as I reacclimatize. Though warfare remains my prime directive, there's nothing wrong with mastering another art.	1																					
38	108		302								Any final products?	27	Say, where did all the S2 people get off to?	28																				
39	27	30	301								Lucia	I have many batches of final products. Everyone, and you, Commandant, will be pleasantly surprised.	1																					
40	28	29	301								Lucia	Did you have business with Section 2? They just moved to a new workspace a few weeks ago.	1																					
41	29	30	301								Lucia	This workspace will stay unused until the next department settles in, so I repurposed it into a temporary kitchen.	1																					
42	30		301								Lucia	Now that you're here, would you care to try the fruits of my labor?	1																					
43	109		302								Color me intrigued.	31	(Accept fate)	32																				
44	31	34	301								Lucia	Excellent! I thought you would refuse. I'll be just a moment.	1																					
45	32	33	301								Lucia	Why the long face, Commandant? Has past experiences soured your expectations? Not to worry, everything will be all right this time.	1																					
46	33	34	301			RImgBg1Shake						As she says this, Lucia suddenly grabs hold of your arm, the thin smile on her face radiating paralyzing authority.																						
47	34		301									You acquiesce. Lucia darts to the oven in the back and retrieves a lavishly decorated platter.																						
48	35		301									You are first struck by the sheer amount of food on the platter. Then, by the surprisingly artistic presentation. Finally, the aroma reaches your nose from far away—a singular, one-note aroma.																						
49	110		302								You put this platter together yourself?	36	This... smell...	37																				
50	36	40	301								Lucia	I followed the instructions in the database to the letter. It took me a while, but I'd say the end result is pretty good, no?	1																					
51	37	38	301								Lucia	Sharp nose, Commandant... I did add a touch of Section 2's chemical aromatics.	1																					
52	38	39	301								Lucia	I know it sounds... hazardous, but the S2 researcher told me that it's non-poisonous and harmless. Just a normal non-nutritional additive, he said.	1																					
53	39	40	301								Lucia	They told me that they used to lather a bit of it on their ration cakes. It didn't change the way it went down, but the aroma was enough to whet their appetite. So I took the liberty of adding it to every dish.	1																					
54	40		301								Lucia	Anyway, let's have you try the dessert first, Commandant. Seeing as there's no place to sit around here, I'll feed you.	1																					
55	41		301									Lucia brings over a dish with the outward appearance of pudding. She spoons a mouthful and brings it to your mouth.																						
56	111		302								I can eat on my own.	42	(Open wide)	43																				
57	42	43	301								Lucia	It doesn't matter if you eat it or if I feed you, as long as it goes down, right? No need to argue. Open up, now. Ahhhh...	1																					
58	43		301									And so, the smooth spoonful of pudding slides onto your tongue with a plop. True to Lucia's word, the aromatics only improve one dimension of the food.																						
59	44		301									The other dimensions, as it slithers across your taste buds, is nothing like the first. The intense experience hearkens you to a deep, dark, forgotten past.																						
60	45		301									This "pudding" tastes just like a black substance Lucia has offered you before. The look may deceive, and the smell certainly masks it, but you are positive that the two are mostly, if not exactly, the same thing.																						
61	46		301									Ah... Ah...																						
62	47		301								Lucia	What's with the open mouth, Commandant...? Ah, I see! You want more? Here, I'll feed you something else.	1																					
63	112		202							1																								
64	48		301									A single, subdued, torturous sound slips unbidden from your lips, but Lucia seems to be living in her own world. She feeds you bite after bite of her "creations."																						
65	49		301									As morsel after morsel of Lucia's culinary masterpieces fill the cavity of your slackened jaws, the paradoxical sensations it brings roil and swirl, until finally, they implode as a microcosm of a new world.																						
66	113		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png																								
67	50		301									Let there be light.																						
68	51		301									And—																						
69	114		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
70	52		301									Let there be night.																						
71	53		301									You suddenly come to a sickening realization that you have not ascended into omnipotence. You fall.																						
72	115		401							2	1506																							
73	54		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Commandant? Commandant, why are you falling over all of a sudden?
