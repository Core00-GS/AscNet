15	15		301								Bridget	Hey, Commandant. Are you alright? Good thing I got you before the Red Tide did. Hey, why are you covered in sweat?	1																					
16	16		302								...I'm good...	17	I wasn't expecting you to come rescue us.	18																				
17	17	20	301								Bridget	Alright, that's good. Here's the results from the Support Force's survey of the area. We found something very interesting. Maybe this is the target we've been looking for.	1																					
18	18		301								Bridget	I finally found a route to transport supplies to the new temporary base. I didn't expect to run into you.	1																					
19	19		301								Bridget	By the way, here's the results from the Support Force's survey of the area. We found something very interesting. Maybe this is the target we've been looking for.	1																					
20	20		301								Bridget	However, with our equipment and abilities, we can't track them more accurately. Fortunately, the Red Tide doesn't appear to be spreading this far. We'll leave it to you for an in-depth investigation, Gray Ravens.	1																					
21	21		301								Bridget	The Support Force will be responsible for cleaning up the nearby Corrupted to ensure that your investigation will not be disturbed.	1																					
22	22		302								We'll leave it up to you then.	23																						
23	23		301									Bridget waves, then salutes sternly.																						
24	24		301								Bridget	We're on it. Proceed with the investigation.	1

27	27		301							1	Lee	According to the GPR survey results from Bridget, by comparing the coordinate data left by Huaxu with its coverage, our target should be in an abandoned city less than 2km away from here.	1

31	31		301							1	Liv	"City 075". Records show that 600,000 residents had to evacuate during the Post-Pandemic Age after the failure of the central purification filter. Since then, it has been left abandoned...	2																					
32	32		302								I didn't see this coming...	33																						
33	33		302								There's a huge cavern under the city.	34																						
34	34		301								Liv	Well, it was actually a military underground fort set up in case of a nuclear war. The buildings on the ground level are used as a front. There were never any residents here to begin with.	2																					
35	35		301								Liv	The content of the official report is forged. It's not that it was abandoned... It was never even occupied.	2																					
36	36		301								Lee	They probably didn't expect that the underground fortifications set up in response to the war would eventually become a hotbed for the spread of the Punishing Virus.	1																					
37	37		301								Lee	However, the information obtained through imaging is too little to determine the exact scale of the cavern. At present, the scale is still quite massive.	1																					
38	38		302								Liv, can you confirm the coordinates of the entrance?	39																						
39	39		301								Liv	Attempting to survey potential routes... but I'm receiving strong electromagnetic interference.	2																					
40	40		301								Lee	After all, it was designed as a military refuge. I won't be surprised if they installed anti-reconnaissance measures.	1

43	43		301							1	Lucia	We speculated that it is likely to be the Ascendants' base. We need to be fully prepared to infiltrate the enemy's home.	1

46	46		301							1	Liv	So far, we haven't detected any Ascendant activity that could reveal their whereabouts. If Huaxu's coordinates really do lead us to them...	2																					
47	47		301								Lee	We still haven't ruled out that it might be a trap. That being said, recovering data is well worth the risk.	1
