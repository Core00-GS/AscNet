13	12		201							1	1031001																							
14	13		301							1	Liv	Lucia, are you still thinking about what Roland said?	1																					
15	14		201							1	500166	5																						
16	15		301							1	Lucia	Yeah. Even though I've been catching glimpses of her projections along the way, I still don't understand why Luna would become an agent.	1																					
17	16		301								Lucia	In my memories... she was the kind of person who'd save up food for a neighbor's children. But now...	1																					
18	17		302								Should we look into it?	18																						
19	18		301								Lucia	You mean... looking into her records here with the Spear of F.O.S.?	1																					
20	19		201							1	500026																							
21	20		301							1	Lee	I hope her mind hasn't been altered by the Punishing Virus like the other Corrupted.	1																					
22	21		302								If she has, she wouldn't be able to retain her mind.	22																						
23	22		301								Lee	We've seen so many unbelievable changes on our journey, I won't be surprised to see one more. It's not unprecedented to the creatures of Earth.	1																					
24	23		201							1	500166	5																						
25	24		301							1	Lucia	...If she has been completely taken over by the Punishing Virus as you said, and she's only imitating Luna's mindâ€”	1																					
26	25		301								Lucia	Even though I'm her sister, I... will stop her.	1																					
27	26		302								Let's find out.	27																						
28	27		301									So much has happened during the time when they were apart, and now the two sisters are walking down drastically different paths.																						
29	28		301									Now, Lucia is looking for information on the Ascendants, while trying to find out why Luna turned into one. Whatever answer has been hidden from her in the past, today is the day when all is revealed.																						
30	29		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Let's uncover the truth.	1

33	32		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Lucia clutches her weapon and smiles, bitterly, as she steps forward, and the four of you walk alongside the bridge for a while.																						
34	33		301									Suddenly, you can hear the low rumbling of machines running coming from below.																						
35	34		201							1	500026		400																					
36	35		201							2	1031001	7	-400																					
37	36		301							1	Lee	Wait... Liv, do you hear anything?	1																					
38	37		301								Liv	The sound of a machine activated, dull and heavy. It's coming from the giant pillar in the Core Area up ahead.	2																					
39	38		301								Lee	An underground industrial complex of this size must consist of a megaton electromagnetic platform lift to connect the surface and the subsurface area. It's most likely to be in the Core Area ahead.	1																					
40	39		302								Hold on, what is that?	501

42	40		201							1	500263																							
43	41		301							1		Lee swiftly draws his gun and aims at where you are looking. What he is aiming at, however, is a projection without a body.	1																					
44	42		302								Is that what Huaxu actually looks like?	43																						
45	43		301									Lucia quickly reaches out and tries to grab the specter, but her hand passes through without interruption.	1																					
46	44		201							1	500026																							
47	45		301							1	Lee	Just another projection from the Spear of F.O.S., probably the same kind we saw back in the ruins.	1																					
48	46		201							1	500263																							
49	47		301									Huaxu hovers ahead of you in silence, as if guiding you further inside.	1																					
50	48		201							1	500166	5
