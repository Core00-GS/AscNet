5	5		302								That's great.	8	Does that mean I can finally clock out?	6																				
6	6		301								Lee	...	1																					
7	7		302								DId you just roll your eyes?	8	I was joking!	8																				
8	8		301								Lee	We're approaching the edge of the human inland city.	1																					
9	9		301								Lee	Our intel shows that the station up ahead has been abandoned since the Post-Pandemic Age. It doesn't even have a designation number...	1																					
10	10		301								Lee	All we have to do next is stop the train for one final checkup, and then it will be properly functioning again. The Heterozygotes on board have all been cleared out as well.	1																					
11	11		301								Lee	Akdilek's repair team can handle the rest of the repairs.	1																					
12	12		301								Lee	We were quite effective back there with Sophia's help.	1																					
13	13		302								That's good to know.	14	Sophia must be pretty skilled to have your approval.	14

19	19		301									Suddenly, the door to your cart opens, and Sophia pops her head in like a cat. She scans the cart with her eyes and gingerly walks in after seeing Lee and you.

21	21		301							1	Sophia	Looking for you.	1

33	33		301									Lee walks toward Sophia, and the two are ready to depart. Before leaving, Sophia stops and turns around.

35	35		301							1	Sophia	Thank you.	1																					
36	36		302								...To whom?	37

39	39		301									Sophia repeats with a serious expression. Her voice is soft and light, but full of conviction.																						
40	40		302								It's my job.	41	Y-you're welcome.	41																				
41	41		301									You catch a brief moment when Lee might have smiled, but it quickly disappears as Sophia turns back toward him.

56	56		301							1	Liv	I've already uploaded the satellite map of this area. The station we are stopping at was an active supply depot for the desert area during the Golden Age.	1																					
57	57		204							1	7																							
58	58		301								Liv	The rest of the depot fell in NE 2153. Only this platform remains functional due to the Eternal Engine passing through regularly.	1																					
59	59		301								Liv	The intel calls this platform... Groening Station?	1																					
60	60		201							1	500128																							
61	61		301							1	Bianca	Groening?	1																					
62	62		301								Bianca	That was where I boarded the Eternal Engine.	1																					
63	63		201							1	1031001																							
64	64		301							1	Liv	Eh? So the train does provide a short-route round trip...	1																					
65	65		301								Liv	...Anyway, I've mapped out the key routes everyone should take inside the station!	1
