5	5		301									—Just like how this CUB has been silently following Rosetta, unresponsive to other external interferences.

7	7		301							1	Rosetta	One more parameter to test. Time to collect data on its maximum speed.	1																					
8	8		301								Rosetta	Here is the route. I'll observe it from here.	1																					
9	9		301									After setting the route, Rosetta stands on a snow-covered bluff.																						
10	10		301								Rosetta	Begin!	1																					
11	11		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Receiving the command, the CUB stirs its front hooves, kicking up the snow, then quickly gallops along the planned route.

14	14		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Rosetta connects with the CUB to monitor the data and establishes a visual link with its visual module.																						
15	15		301									Through the connection, Rosetta watches the snow fly by at blistering speed.																						
16	16		301									As the CUB charges through the bush, snow falling from the trees is quickly swept off the frame without any chance to accumulate.																						
17	17		301									—Just like how she ran in the past.																						
18	18		201							1	500332																							
19	19		301							1		As the CUB advances along the route, a white figure suddenly dashes by a low-lying patch of bushes off to the side.																						
20	20		301									Following it's alert protocol, the CUB slowly approaches the bushes.																						
21	21		301									Rosetta is unable to discern anything from the various tracks found in the area. As the CUB gets closer, Rosetta subconsciously holds her breath.																						
22	22		301									Right as the CUB cautiously checks the bushes, she sees a snow squirrel.																						
23	23		301									The snow squirrel dashes in front of the CUB and climbs to the top of a tree carrying some kind of nut.																						
24	24		301									Rosetta exhales quietly after confirming that everything is alright.																						
25	25		301									The CUB watches the squirrel disappear into the treetops, then raises its legs as if to jump.																						
26	26		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryLineSpreadNew.prefab	2																							
27	27		301									After jumping once, then twice, the CUB continues galloping onward.	1																					
28	28		301									However, it no longer charges relentlessly through the branches and snow. Instead, it begins to prance briskly.	1																					
29	29		301									The visual module quickly shifts up and down as it jumps and lands.	1																					
30	30		301									As its speed begins to increase, the inertia extends its duration in the air with each jump.

36	36		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryLineSpreadNew.prefab																							
37	37		301									The CUB seems to be deliberately jumping as it makes its way forward.																						
38	38		301									A thought long buried in Rosetta's M.I.N.D. quickly resurfaces.																						
39	39		301									—The meaning behind jumping.																						
40	40		301									It is the momentary thrill of breaking free from the surface—the thrill of freedom.																						
41	41		301									Breaking free... Breaking free... Continuously breaking free from the surface's hold.																						
42	42		301									A tall snow slope appears around the bend. Rather than stopping, the CUB increases speed.	1																					
43	43		301									It quickly ascends the snow slope and leaps high into the sky from its summit. The frame's exterior reflects a striking display of sunlight.	1																					
44	44		301									Landing on the other side of the snow slope, the CUB sees a group of snow-white figures.	1																					
45	45		301									Creatures that share a resemblance to the CUB's equine form.

48	48		301							1	Rosetta	Hmm... Looks like we've accidentally stumbled into their neck of the woods.	1																					
49	49		301									A herd of horses is a rare sight to behold in the wilderness.																						
50	50		301									They gather together and look at the CUB.																						
51	51		301									After a few circles around the CUB, the horses slowly leave. But before they do, they turn to look back at it.																						
52	52		301								Rosetta	Is that... an invitation?	1																					
53	53		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryTongxunHalfNew.prefab		1																					
54	54		201							1	500332																							
55	55		301							1		Right as Rosetta ponders their behavior, the CUB takes a step forward.																						
56	56		401							2	1501																							
57	57		301									The system issues a warning to indicate a deviation from the planned route, but the CUB continues to follow the horses.																						
58	58		301									What starts off as a slow trot turns into an all-out gallop with the herd.																						
59	59		301									It runs with the horses.																						
60	60		401							2	1514																							
61	61		301									The crisp sound of the horses' hooves crushing branches and the rushing wind through the snowy forest drowns out the CUB's warning system.																						
62	62		301									Delicate snowflakes flutter in the dazzling sunlight.																						
63	63		301									The CUB gallops with reckless abandon. Some kind of signal seems to be sprouting within it.																						
64	64		301									Phweeee—																						
65	65		301									After a long whistle, the horses surrounding the CUB gradually disappear.																						
66	66		301									Rosetta uses her familiarity with the surrounding environment to rush toward the CUB.																						
67	67		301									Her figure appears in the CUB's field of vision—the first person it saw after waking up from within the dark confines of the airdrop.

73	73		301							1	Asimov	I'm done with the preparations. How's your progress?	2																					
74	74		301									Asimov's transmission cuts her off mid-sentence. She remains quiet for a moment before slowly opening her mouth.																						
75	75		301								Rosetta	...There were some deviations with the preset configurations, but I've collected all of the data.	1																					
76	76		301								Asimov	I'll look into the deviations later. Right now, let's finish calibrating your frame.	2

82	82		301								Rosetta	Let's get back.	1																					
83	83		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Receiving the order, the CUB slowly walks up to Rosetta's side and continues back to the familiar darkness of the airdrop.
