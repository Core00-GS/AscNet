3	3		301									The night after everything has ended—																						
4	4		301									With the rising of the moon, the crowd also ebbs back to their rooms.																						
5	5		301									Leaving only a lone silhouette in a mountain of materials, tinkering away at something.																						
6	6		301								???	A little bit of this...																						
7	7		301									Click-clack. She ignites something as she mumbles. Then a brilliant flash of light zips past your eyes and explodes above the ocean...																						
8	8		301									...Illuminating the figure, revealing her as...

10	10		302								Karen?	11																						
11	11		301								Karenina	What? Whatcha doing out here and so late?	1																					
12	12		302								I should be the one asking you that.	13																						
13	13		301								Karenina	Can't you tell?! I'm experimenting with fireworks.	1																					
14	14		301									Karenina points at the supply crates with her thumb. They all seem to have firework symbols on them.																						
15	15		301								Karenina	They got an entire workshop of explosives that pop off in nice and clean patterns 'ere. I might as well have a go at tinkering with 'em, so we can light 'em up in actual combat and—	1																					
16	16		301								Karenina	BOOM goes the Corrupted!	1																					
17	17		302								...	118																						
18	118		204							1	5																							
19	18		301								Karenina	WHAT? Why are ya looking at me like that? You wanna fight? And why aren't you asleep anyways?! What if your baby birds all come crying to ya, aye?!	1																					
20	19		302								Well... I finally got a break, so...	20	Just... kinda wanna take a walk around...	20																				
21	119		204							1																								
22	20		301								Karenina	Tsk. Too much free time, yeah? Then come help me find some mats.	1																					
23	21		302								What are you missing?	22																						
24	22		301								Karenina	Ethanol... Let me think...	1																					
25	23		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Karenina	I think I saw an abandoned bar nearby—should have some of the stuff. Didn't check though since I was busy. Come now and go with me!	1																					
26	24		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory204.png																								
27	25		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Karenina drags you into an abandoned bar...																						
28	26		301									With the electricity fixed, the place now seems to be illuminated in a dim and moody glow. Some service bots have also regained function, and are now continuing their duties before the electricity outage.																						
29	28		301								Service Bot	Please... survey...																						
30	29		302								Survey?	30																						
31	30		301									Likely the result of abandonment, the voice modules of these service bots have heavily deteriorated through the ages. Most of the bot's words are muffled by crackling and static noises.																						
32	32		301								Service Bot	Please... why... dissatisfied...																						
33	200		204							1	5																							
34	33		301								Karenina	Get lost! Stop botherin' me!	1																					
35	34		301									Ignoring Karenina's shouts, the service bot totters before her to present her with a survey about different alcoholic beverages.	1																					
36	1011		502							PanelActor1Shake																								
37	35		301							1	Karenina	Urgh! I said—GET LOST!	1																					
38	38		301									Her screams seem to have attracted the attention of even more service bots. They pile around her, asking for her to complete their survey.	1																					
39	39		301								Karenina	AAAAAGGGHHH!!! ALRIGHT! ALRIGHT! I GET IT! FINE! SURVEY, YEAH?	1																					
40	40		301									Seeing the tightly packed questions on the survey screen, Karenina furrows her brows.	1																					
41	41		301								Karenina	It's ALL questions about your drinks?! I done never had no sip of your stuff!	1																					
42	42		301									Scanning around, she notices some freshly mixed drinks on the counter.																						
43	44		301								Karenina	Outta the way! I gotta at least try your blotters 'fore I fill in your surveys, yeah?!	1																					
44	46		301									She shoves the service bots before her aside, then stomps over to the counter for an iridescent drink with colors out of space. She gives it a cautious whiff.	1																					
45	47		301								Karenina	Smells... alright, I guess?	1																					
46	1012		502							PanelActor1Shake																								
47	49		301							1		She gives it a gingerly sip—and spits, almost immediately, as if seeing Kamui cross-dress. A sickening miasma wafts past you, followed by Karenina's not-family-friendly curses. You learn a lot of new words.	1																					
48	50		301									She plonks the glass on the counter and grabs the service bot before her by what would be its collar.	1																					
49	1013		502							PanelActor1Shake																								
50	52		301							1	Karenina	WHAT THE FLYING **** IS THIS SEWAGE SAUCE?! This is WORSE than battery acid!!!	1																					
51	53		301								Karenina	You sell even one glass o' this doo-doo and I'll eat my cannon!	1																					
52	2001		204							1																								
53	56		301									Karenina's shouts seem to have incited the service bots to gather around her once more.																						
54	57		301								Karenina	Wha...? What are y'all tryna do now?!	1																					
55	58		301								Service Bot	Please... survey...																						
56	59		301								Karenina	Just go home—get scrapped—pray for better coding ya next life if you're mixin' this sorta junk-gunk!	1																					
57	60		301								Service Bot	Please... survey...																						
58	61		301									The service bots repeat themselves.																						
59	62		301								Karenina	...PAH! Fine! Happy now?!	1																					
60	63		301									Even knowing deep down that it is all pointless, Karenina still fills in the survey question by question. With that done, she squishes her finger on the submit button.																						
61	64		301								Karenina	...Huh? Survey records?	1																					
62	65		301									The icon on the bottom right of the screen seems to have drawn her attention. She taps on the icon, and the survey database pops up. The last survey is submitted a long, long time ago.																						
63	66		301									Looks like the bar was abandoned shortly after the Great Retreat. The surveys with a long time interval between them all seem to come from visitors after the bar practically shut down.																						
64	67		301								Karenina	What kinda bullcrap suggestions are these?! "plz add squidy squeezies to the OJs :)"?!	1																					
65	68		301								Karenina	Get the guy who wrote this over here, and I'll force 20 barrels of it down their gullet!	1																					
66	69		302								Must be a prank by a visitor, huh...	70																						
67	70		301								Karenina	A prank alright—But don't you serve-bots at least try it yourselves?! This is just nuke-juice!	1																					
68	71		302								These robots don't have taste modules.	72																						
69	72		301								Karenina	Tch. Clunky old models.	1																					
70	73		301									All of a sudden, the midnight chime rings in the bar. The service bots all pause.																						
71	74		301								Karenina	What now?!	1																					
72	75		301								Manager Bot	Closing hours... Today's sales... Quota unmet... Improvement required...																						
73	77		301									With the announcement from the robot before the cashier, the other service bots quickly squirm behind the counter and begin looking for ingredients to mix drinks with.																						
74	79		301								Service Bot	New survey... received... Implementing suggestions...																						
75	80		301									Pausing and beeping to analyze the new survey, the service bots incorporate Karenina's suggestions and begin mixing drinks.																						
76	82		301								Karenina	That's what these tin-blobs' been doing before we got here?	1																					
77	83		302								Yeah.	84	And they will be too, after we leave.	84																				
78	881		204							1	5																							
79	84		301								Karenina	This happens bloody everywhere! Ugh! How many robots did humans leave behind before they took to the skies?!	1																					
80	85		301								Karenina	There's no customer to come, and yet they're here doing useless work!	1																					
81	87		301								Service Bot	Please taste... New... recommendations... implemented... Please...	1																					
82	91		301									A decrepit-looking service bot mixes a drink and returns to Karenina.																						
83	92		301								Karenina	****** ****! It's always like this!	1																					
84	93		302								Let's leave.	94																						
85	94		301									Karenina perfunctorily answers you through her curses. She jostles the robots before her, parting the sea of bots to ruffle through the counter for her needed materials, then squeezes out from the clamor of requests.																						
86	96		301								Karenina	Oi! Let's bunk!	1																					
87	97		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She extends a hand toward you before you become bot-sandwich fillings. You take her hand, and she pulls you out of the robot pile. The two of you hastily escape from the bar.																						
88	99		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory206.png																								
89	102		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						But the clamor and clatter of the bots can still be heard. Looking back, you see a horde of them bumbling out of the bar and chasing after you two.																						
90	98		302								They're coming after us!	104																						
91	104		301								Karenina	Move faster! Bolt!	1																					
92	105		301									The two of you return to where Karenina was messing with the fireworks, but the service bots are still after you.																						
93	106		301								Service Bot	Please... taste-test...																						
94	107		302								Looks like we aren't getting away.	109																						
95	109		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Karenina	Tch. A fight it is, then!	1
