5	5		301									Harley Jo and the others, having returned to the ground, are speeding through the forest with Egret leading the way.																						
6	6		301									The area surrounding CPF 040 is aflame from Egret's bombardment, stopping the Hetero-Sapiens from catching up.																						
7	7		301									Still, countless Hetero-Sapiens are coming after them from all corners of the Forest Park Ruins.																						
8	8		301									Lucia, Lee, Liv, Harley Jo, everyone... They have already forgotten how many Hetero-Sapiens they have taken down on the way.																						
9	9		301									They only have one objective in mind: break through, then send the sample back.																						
10	10		301									This is a race with extremely simple rules.																						
11	11		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					A race against time, against the Punishing Virus.

16	16		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Ten meters‚Äîfive meters‚Äîone meter‚Äîthe almost-infinite forest has finally come to an end before the group. The expansive field before them has declared the race over.																						
17	17		301									The soldiers that have taken over Hans' baton have completed their duties.																						
18	18		301			RImgBg1Shake						Harley Jo loses his strength with the sudden change of scenery, tumbling to the ground and rolling forward.																						
19	19		301									He immediately gets up and sets up the portable rocket system, activating it after loading the sample, sending this spark of hope back to Babylonia.

26	26		301							1	Harley Jo	No, no, no. I'm here to thank the Egrets.	1																					
27	27		301								Harley Jo	As the Chief Commander said, we wouldn't have gotten out of the forest without your lead.	1																					
28	28		301								Harley Jo	You're all hurt too from the fight. Let's take a break before the enemies catch up. Yata and I will try to contact the other areas.	1																					
29	29		201							1	500019																							
30	30		301							1	Construct Soldier	Commandant Harley Jo, there's a transmission from Babylonia.	1

36	36		301							1	Liaison Officer	We just received intel from near the Forest Park not too long ago.	1																					
37	37		301								Liaison Officer	While you were deep inside the forest, a small transport craft on the outskirt picked up two Scavengers who claimed to have escaped from the ruins. The reserved serum from CPF 040 on them corroborated their stories.	1																					
38	38		301								Liaison Officer	And they... are the last survivors in the Forest Park...	1																					
39	39		301								Liaison Officer	Despite... we... urgently dispatch... large transport craft for your retreat, please... hold.	1

42	42		301									After Babylonia's message ends, Harley Jo passes on the message to the group that has just escaped. The mood immediately relaxes a little; it is one of the few good news they can get, all things considered.																						
43	43		201							1	500019																							
44	44		301							1	Construct A	Simon, we all got out with our Inver-Devices more or less intact. None of us Constructs were infected.	1																					
45	45		201							1	500362	1																						
46	46		301							1	Simon	I'm glad I can help... help y'all... the Chief...	1																					
47	47		204							1	17																							
48	48		301								Simon	It's good that I can... share „Äêkuroname„Äë's burden...	1																					
49	49		201							1	500019																							
50	50		301							1	Construct A	Right, I can't believe you did it all yourself, that's... Simon... Simon?!	1																					
51	51		401							1	202																							
52	52		301									The Construct's tone starts getting nervous as he sees blood dripping down his uniform.																						
53	53		301									Blood is dripping out of Simon's eyes, nose, ears, and mouth, dying his uniform bright red.																						
54	54		202							1					1																			
55	55		301									Simon cannot respond to the Construct now.																						
56	56		301									As strong as his Mind Beacon is, the stress that should have been carried by two can easily crush one's healthy brain within seconds.																						
57	57		301									With that stress on his mind, Simon held on for minutes until everyone retreated from the Forest Park Ruins, where the enemies' effect on the Inver-Devices weakens.																						
58	58		201							1	500019																							
59	59		301							1	Construct A	Medic! No, wait, w-who knows first-aid on humans?! Simon is...	1																					
60	60		301									With his cry, everyone gathers around Simon. Harley Jo lays him down on the ground from the Construct's shoulders, and a few Support-type Constructs begin to check on him.																						
61	61		202							1					1																			
62	62		301								Support Construct	Simon... Sir...																						
63	63		301									The Support-type Construct is getting anxious from the extended fight and the constant hits. Eleanor crouches next to her, gripping her hands tightly.																						
64	64		301								Eleanor	Don't get frustrated. With timely treatment, this will not be the end for Simon and „Äêkuroname„Äë.																						
65	65		301								Support Construct	Right...																						
66	66		301									The Support-type Construct finally regains control over her trembling body. She is about to say something, but when she saw what lies ahead, she stopped.																						
67	67		202							1	2				1																			
68	68		301									Before her, two figures approach from the horizon.

71	71		301									The grass underneath their feet are obfuscated by a red glow appearing on the ground.																						
72	72		301									They walk toward the makeshift campsite the group just built.																						
73	73		301									They walk faster and faster, and the size of the mutating ground also expands.																						
74	74		301									The distance between them and the camp shortens in a brief moment. They are no longer the unmoving newborns. Now, panthers on the hunt would pale against them.																						
75	75		301									Their shapes become clear as they appear before the camp. They are none other than the twins born from the advanced Hetero-Hive Mother.																						
76	76		301									Right now, they have grown to be stronger and faster than any known living thing.																						
77	77		301									As tireless guardians and pursuers, they will avenge their territory that has been invaded and violated.																						
78	78		201							1	500368																							
79	79		301							1	Vanessa	I see they aren't just going to let go of the people who took a chunk of their "mommy."	1

82	82		301									Harley Jo slaps himself in the face, replacing his usual glee with a solemn expression.

84	84		201							1	500373	4																						
85	85		301							1	Harley Jo	We're on a timer here...	1																					
86	86		301								Harley Jo	Simon's and the Chief's wounds are worrying. But I suppose our priority is to fend off the enemies before us.	1																					
87	87		301								Harley Jo	Gray Ravens and Simon's squad, will you lend me your strength?	1

93	93		201							1	500373	4																						
94	94		301							1	Harley Jo	Haha... Right...	1																					
95	95		301								Harley Jo	Words are redundant now.	1																					
96	96		301								Harley Jo	Regardless of the doom that awaits us, there has only been one thing we can do.	1																					
97	97		202							1					1																			
98	98		301									More and more Constructs prepare their weapons and stand at the front of the defense line.																						
99	99		201							1	500374	21																						
100	100		301							1		Yata stares at the twins, and her mechanical arms begin to turn translucent. Lifting herself up with her tentacle-like robotic arms, she merges into the environment until only the shimmering red light on her mask remains.	1																					
101	101		201							1	500373	4																						
102	102		301							1	Harley Jo	It's up to us now.	1																					
103	103		301								Harley Jo	Simon... „Äêkuroname„Äë... Just a few more seconds, just a few...	1																					
104	104		202							1					1																			
105	105		301									All the Hetero-Sapiens inside the Pulia Forest Park Ruins are out in force, their roars shaking the entire forest behind the group.

107	107		201							2	500364	3	-400
