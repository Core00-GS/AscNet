21	21		301							1	Murray	And you are...?	1																					
22	22		301									When Murray turns around to face the girl, the girl, too, turns to face him with a mischievous look on her face. Facing Murray and waving at him, the girl walks backward with the other hand behind her back.

30	30		301									Muray is taken aback by those words. Where is she from? And what does she want from him? How does she know his name in the first place? Did she mean what she just said as a warning? He'll have to eliminate her if it's necessary to do so.

42	42		301								Nanami	...Hi.	2																					
43	43		301									On the researcher's table is the hologram of an iris. Nanami would have mistaken it for an actual iris if she hadn't known better.																						
44	44		301									The girl with short pink hair turns around and casts Nanami a gentle yet somewhat aloof smile.

48	48		301									From her question, Nanami senses not a trace of surprise, as though she knew all along that Nanami would come here.																						
49	49		301								Nanami	Someone told me that you'd be able to help me.	2																					
50	50		301								Ishmael	And I wonder who that might be... But that's hardly the point here. What matters is that you came to seek my help, and I love helping people.	1																					
51	51		301									With a smile, Ishmael gestures for Nanami to sit down.																						
52	52		301								Ishmael	State your wish, please.	1

62	62		301							1	Nanami	It took a lot of effort for me to become what I am now. I really want everybody to see this...	1																					
63	63		301									Nanami gives Power a gentle touch. Inspired by her conversation with the girl, Nanami decided to modify Power—dazzling, the stars on it are supposed to be a symbol of humankind's romance and courage. They also show that Nanami is the one and only Nanami in this world.																						
64	64		301								Nanami	But I have more important things to do right now.	1																					
65	65		301								Nanami	Mecha babushka, give me the coordinates.	1																					
66	66		301								Gestalt	What you do will not change this catastrophe.																						
67	67		301								Nanami	Even if my efforts are futile, I'll still do the same...	1																					
68	68		301									Because I'm doing it out of love.																						
69	69		301								Nanami	I don't want to destroy humankind and all the interesting things they created.	1																					
70	70		301									Nanami looks up at Eden in the sky. Haicma probably managed to evacuate from Babylonia with them already.																						
71	71		301								Nanami	And things are changing, aren't they? I'll help make their wish come true, and they'll help make mine come true, too.	1

79	79		301								Girl	We won't be able to predict the future if humankind possesses free will. humankind knows free will through experience. Free will is a substantial part of individual consciousness.																						
80	80		301								Girl	In the same vein, predictions of the future contradicts free will.																						
81	81		301								Girl	Humankind can't predict the future precisely because they're able to make free choices.																						
82	82		301								Girl	Conversely, if you already know the future, then you won't be able to go against your fate, nor can you tell people about what you know about the future.																						
83	83		301								Girl	Even if you already know all the possibilities and can choose the best one out of them, the outcome—or some tragedy that might happen along the way—is still inevitable.																						
84	84		301								Girl	I think you need no reminder, Nanami, but...																						
85	85		301								Girl	I'm you from the future.																						
86	86		301									She sees herself... in that future. With the machines, she travels on and on through the universe trying to figure out why the machines awakened and their identity.																						
87	87		301									Giving up her freedom, she became a central AI that leads the spaceship and all the awakened machines on a permanent journey through the infinite universe.																						
88	88		301									The surviving humans still have a chance, yet their fate is now up to them. humankind has only themselves to count on down the path to a promising future.																						
89	89		301									Abandoned by Earth, the girl sits quietly by the window as she speaks, occasionally stealing glances at the blue planet billions of light-years away.																						
90	90		301									At the end of time, the universe, and everything, she finally sees it... she sees the root of all catastrophes. She also finds a door through which humankind can go and the key to it.																						
91	91		301									Then... she sends the secret to the past—a secret that should have been left untold.																						
92	92		301									She prays...																						
93	93		301									Humankind lives on in the infinite expanse that is the universe, and the machines set out on a journey with her in search of peace and their identity.

101	101		301								"Nanami"	It's time to say goodbye.	1																					
102	102		301									Nanami holds out her hands and locks her fingers with her much younger self. With their heads against each other's, Nanami finds herself instantly awash with yearning, sadness, and loneliness.																						
103	103		301								Nanami	Take these with you... and look for "Ishmael" when you've made a final decision. You'll be able to find the answer you came seeking there.	1
