3	3		301			DialogEnable						City 043 Conservation Area Basement, 03:00 a.m.																						
4	4		301									Nearly five hours have passed since Liv and others set out. All refugees still able to move freely have been evacuated.																						
5	5		301									They have walked for five hours, but they still have not managed to evacuate the conservation area in City 043 due to the overall speed of the crowd.																						
6	6		301									The horde of Hetero-Creatures headed this way is estimated to enter the conservation area according to their "scheduled" arrival in three hours.																						
7	7		301									There are only a few dozen people left in the enclosed basement. All the Constructs stationed in the conservation area are on the surface, leaving the refugees anxiously waiting for news from Gray Raven.																						
8	8		301									Vanessa sits alone in the dark room, monitoring the trajectory of the Hetero-Creatures on a large number of holo-screens and sending the intel to Babylonia with no response.																						
9	9		301									Following that, she recalculates the tactical deployment of Constructs in the conservation area and the best evacuation route for Gray Raven based on the enemy's new trajectory.																						
10	10		301									After completing her work, she stands up from the screens and walks up to the sick bed nearby.																						
11	11		201							1	500293	13																						
12	12		301							1	Vanessa	...Hah, Chief.	1																					
13	13		301									She smiles mockingly, then sits beside the bed.																						
14	14		301								Vanessa	If you knew your recklessness would have this outcome, would you still have done what you did?	1																					
15	15		301									Vanessa gently strokes your ear as if waiting for an answer.																						
16	16		301								Vanessa	Let me guess, you'd say, "I'll sacrifice everything to protect my comrades," huh?	1																					
17	17		301									She gives herself a smile of self-mockery, then slowly moves her fingers down your ear and puts her hand firmly on your throat.																						
18	18		204							1																								
19	19		301								Vanessa	I'm sure you'd be disgusted right now seeing yourself like this.	1																					
20	20		301								Vanessa	So weak and fragile that you can't even push my hand away.	1																					
21	21		301								Vanessa	Like a candle in the wind... All for just a couple of puppets? What do you think the instructor who praised you so highly would say now seeing you like this?	1																					
22	22		301									She leans down and whispers softly into your ear. Her fragrant aroma seems at odds with the musty smell of the basement.																						
23	23		204							1	13																							
24	24		301								Vanessa	He'd definitely take back what he said, 【kuroname】. A fool like you can't even protect yourself.	1																					
25	25		301									Vanessa quietly looks at your closed eyes. Your malnourished face from having battled illness for so long looks even more lifeless under the dim lights.																						
26	26		204							1																								
27	27		301								Vanessa	Disgusting... Even if you were awake, the people who've only seen your face plastered on the screens after the Atlantis incident wouldn't even recognize you.	1																					
28	28		301									Even though her mockery falls on deaf ears, she still continues her senseless behavior.																						
29	29		204							1	5																							
30	30		301								Vanessa	Regardless, I wasn't wrong.	1																					
31	31		301								Vanessa	Before this disaster happened, I saw you as a rival that must be defeated... a futile illusion.	1																					
32	32		204							1	13																							
33	33		301								Vanessa	Hmph. But now, what a joke.	1																					
34	34		301								Vanessa	You know, 【kuroname】? I could kill you right now.	1																					
35	35		301									Her grip on your throat suddenly tightens, then relaxes. She smiles and covers your pallid skin with her warm palm.																						
36	36		204							1																								
37	37		301								Vanessa	...But what's the point?	1																					
38	38		301								Vanessa	Before you went into a coma, I looked at your selfless naivety with contempt.	1																					
39	39		301								Vanessa	I figured you'd quickly lose in battle and realize that your starry-eyed view of the world didn't conform to reality.	1																					
40	40		301								Vanessa	This wasn't exactly quick, but maybe now you'll see the world for what it really is.	1																					
41	41		301									Your neck remains ice-cold despite her warm palm. She lifts a finger and checks your pulse.																						
42	42		301								Vanessa	Such a simple battle nearly cost you your life, Chief... What exactly distracted you?	1																					
43	43		301								Vanessa	Or did I waste my time focusing on you so much? You don't deserve to be chief, let alone a role model and a goal for others.	1																					
44	44		301									She slowly gets up, then looks at a holo-screen and a fold-up mirror next to it.																						
45	45		301								Vanessa	The Hetero-Creatures will be here in three hours. If Gray Raven isn't back by then, you're a goner.	1																					
46	46		301								Vanessa	Bambinata and I can get out of here whenever we want.	1																					
47	47		301									She combs her hair in the reflection of the mirror again, but the look in her eyes doesn't match the delicate gesture. Her gaze is wandering and vacant.																						
48	48		301								Vanessa	I know this isn't exactly what a commandant should do.	1																					
49	49		301								Vanessa	F.O.S. College teaches us to always fight the enemy and protect as many people as we can.	1																					
50	50		301									The lonely murmur echoes throughout the empty room. As before, no one responds.																						
51	51		301								Vanessa	But the battlefield isn't so merciful. Not everyone can be saved. No matter who you are, Chief.	1																					
52	52		301								Vanessa	As long as people die, their reputation, rights... or those ridiculous bonds are just dust in the wind.	1																					
53	53		301								Vanessa	You get nothing, and the people you protected will soon forget you.	1																					
54	54		301									Vanessa walks to the simple square table full of holo-screens, but leaves a mote of attention to you laying behind her.																						
55	55		301									She turns around once more and looks at the unchanged bed.																						
56	56		204							1	13																							
57	57		301								Vanessa	【kuroname】, you stupid and naive piece of trash. You're only respected by so many people because they're lost in their own ideals.	1																					
58	58		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Vanessa	Now you have no one to count on. Let me tell you how to maximize the value of survivors.	1

61	61		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						04:30 a.m.																						
62	62		301									An hour and a half before the Hetero-Creatures enter the conservation area, Commandant Vanessa and the four Constructs stationed in the conservation area have all gone to the surface to prepare for combat.																						
63	63		301									In the enclosed basement, Commandant 【kuroname】, 41 soldiers with minor wounds and mobility issues, and the 4 critically wounded patients, Nagayuki, Kanata, Lindsey, and Cali still remain.																						
64	64		301									Aside from them, there is another surprising refugee.																						
65	65		201							1	500261		400																					
66	66		201							2	500413		-400																					
67	67		301							1	Boy B	...	1																					
68	68		301								Boy B	What are you lookin' at? Never seen anyone fall on stairs before?!	1																					
69	69		301								Stanley	...No, it's not that.	2																					
70	70		301									The boy should've evacuated with the first group, but he sneaked into the warehouse on the 3rd floor underground, and accidentally slipped on the stairs, hitting his head and spraining his ankle.																						
71	71		301									He had been unconscious for over an hour, completely out of sight. Despite being woken up by Matches, he had missed the opportunity to leave with the first group of refugees.																						
72	72		301								Boy B	Why's your dog going into the warehouse at a time like this?!	1																					
73	73		301								Stanley	...Matches probably just smelled someone in here. What about you? What were you doing here?	2																					
74	74		301								Boy B	I was just checking to see if that mutt had gone into the warehouse!	1																					
75	75		301								Stanley	...Even if that meant not making it out with the others on time?	2																					
76	76		301								Boy B	I was just going to take a peek!	1																					
77	77		301									He rubs the back of his head and his sprained ankle.																						
78	78		301								Boy B	You don't believe me, do you?	1																					
79	79		301								Stanley	...	2																					
80	80		301								Stanley	Why are you being so defensive?	2																					
81	81		301								Boy B	Because your mutt ate all of my cans! My friend gave me those before he died. He risked everything to get his hands on those... but your dumb mutt ate them!	1																					
82	82		301									Being reminded of the past, the boy chokes back tears.																						
83	83		301								Stanley	I already told you! Matches didn't do anything!	2																					
84	84		201							3	500424		-400			1

87	87		301							1	Boy B	Who cares what you say?! I only believe what I saw!	1																					
88	88		301								Boy B	I wouldn't have gone in there if that stupid conservation was safe!	1																					
89	89		301								Boy B	They said "we should all be in the same boat," then they took all my cans and allowed someone like you to get in!	1																					
90	90		301								Stanley	...	2																					
91	91		301								Boy B	(Sniffles) I thought... I could use those cans to find my big bro...	1																					
92	92		301									The boy falls onto an empty sick bed and starts to cry.																						
93	93		201							2	500411		-400																					
94	94		301								Stanley	...You have a big brother?	2																					
95	95		301								Boy B	Yeah... He's the best big bro in the whole entire world...	1																					
96	96		301									The boy sobs and takes out a shabby journal from his jacket pocket. Half of the pages had fallen out, and the rest are barely clinging on with layers of tape.																						
97	97		301								Boy B	He'd tell me stories every day and draw me whatever I wanted...	1																					
98	98		301									He gently rubs the few remaining pages, which are covered with an assortment of vivid drawings.																						
99	99		301									Roasted chicken, new clothes, an entire house, a bed, a soccer ball, a garden... and even a kind-looking woman.																						
100	100		301									Below the pictures, there's the same phrase repeated over and over.																						
101	101		301								Boy B	Can you read?	1																					
102	102		301								Stanley	A bit. How bout you?	2																					
103	103		301								Boy B	That's nice. My mom taught us a bit before she died, but Bro and I forgot.	1																					
104	104		301									He tries to stop crying and sniffling, then points to the writing beside the kind woman.																						
105	105		301								Boy B	Bro said we can write our wishes in it and Mommy will make our wishes come true up in Heaven.	1																					
106	106		301								Boy B	Look. Mom told us to just write this beside each picture, and Mom will hear our wishes.	1																					
107	107		301									Stanley looks to where the boy is pointing, but discovers that it isn't some magical spell.																						
108	108		301								Stanley	..."Sorry"...	2																					
109	109		301								Boy B	What?	1																					
110	110		301								Stanley	..."Sorry I brought you into this world".	2																					
111	111		301								Boy B	What'd you say?	1																					
112	112		301									Stanley opens his mouth to explain the meaning of the dense handwriting but lowers his head silently as if noticing something.																						
113	113		201							2	500412		-400																					
114	114		301							1	Stanley	N-nothing. I just zoned out there for a second is all.	2																					
115	115		301								Boy B	Hmph... I've never shown this to anyone, and you just get distracted.	1																					
116	116		301								Stanley	Sorry... Anyway, why are you showing me this?	2																					
117	117		301								Boy B	Because... You saved me?	1																					
118	118		301									He awkwardly covers his face with a blanket and curls up.																						
119	119		301								Boy B	Forget it. What's the point of telling someone without any family? Anyway, your dog only found me because he was trying to steal food.	1																					
120	120		301								Stanley	Matches didn't...!	2																					
121	121		301								Boy B	Shut up!	1																					
122	122		301								Boy B	...I know already!	1																					
123	123		301								Boy B	...I've been watching you for the past few days. I... know it now.	1																					
124	124		301									Perhaps, he was beginning to sense the truth. At least, that's how Stanley interprets his response.																						
125	125		301									He knows he wrongly accused Stanley, but can't admit his mistake and doesn't apologize.																						
126	126		301								Boy B	Go to sleep!	1																					
127	127		301									Anxiously rolling over in bed, he winces in pain from the injuries on his head and ankle.																						
128	128		301								Stanley	Alright.	2																					
129	129		202							1	2				1																			
130	130		301									Stanley stops speaking. He looks up into the basement and imagines what was happening outside the window.																						
131	131		301									But right as he wants to lie down on the empty bed and get some rest, he hears a heart-rending cry from the other side of the basement.																						
132	132		301								?	NOOOOOO! Don't go! LINDSEY!!!																						
133	133		301									In this sad cry, another person wandering in the twilight falls into the cold embrace of eternal night.
