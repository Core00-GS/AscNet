4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Gabriel	...As a devotee, I merely wish to rectify any uncertainty of yours.	1																					
5	5		301								Gabriel	Your kindness, I worry, will destabilize the resolve of the Ascension-Network.	1																					
6	6		301								Gabriel	The Network requires an agent of absolute power. Hesitancy and mercy are not the attributes of the devoted.	1																					
7	7		301								Gabriel	You once showed me its power, and that wave of pure strength shook me to my core. Since then, I have decided to follow you and offer myself to the work of the Network.	1																					
8	8		301								Gabriel	But now, you concern me.	1

10	10		301							1		Gabriel's words do not seem to displease Luna. Instead, there is a hint of a smirk on her face.																						
11	11		301								Luna	So, tell me, how would you like to serve the Ascension-Network?	1																					
12	12		201							1	500101																							
13	13		301							1	Gabriel	The Red Tide is the manifestation of the volition from the Punishing Virus.	1																					
14	14		301								Gabriel	They are exhibiting qualities of organic beings, which means... one day, Punishing Virus will be sentient. Like humans.	1																					
15	15		301								Gabriel	All I am doing is further propelling this process and ensuring that, even when conscious, Hetero-Creatures will still be of use to us.	1																					
16	16		301									Several of these creatures slither by Gabriel's feet, gently nuzzling him, almost like they are trying to please him.																						
17	17		301								Gabriel	They are obedient. They will be even greater assets than the Corrupted.	1																					
18	18		301								Gabriel	With the Red Tide and these puppets, corruption will spread throughout the globe in no time. Once Babylonia is gone, nothing will be able to stop us.	1																					
19	19		301								Gabriel	That was why I proposed the first step of our plan—using Huaxu to assault the Gestalt, bringing down Babylonia by force.	1																					
20	20		301								Gabriel	Should Babylonia, the humans' last hope fall, we would be able to execute our plan much more swiftly. A shame, then...	1

23	23		301							1	Luna	Huaxu... didn't disappoint, to a certain extent.	2																					
24	24		301								Luna	It's because of Huaxu that I've obtained the secret behind the Inver-Device. To label that level of technology as highly-classified... Humans are so absurd sometimes.	2																					
25	25		301								Gabriel	Huaxu's failure has not been unexpected. I have never put my faith in an outsider, which is why I have prepared an alternative.	1																					
26	26		301								Luna	Is that what you've been hiding underneath the Core Area?	2																					
27	27		301								Gabriel	...Of course, nothing escapes Miss Luna.	1																					
28	28		301								Luna	Gabriel, you aren't skilled enough to hide things from me yet.	2																					
29	29		301								Luna	I don't care how you do it. I only want results.	2																					
30	30		301								Gabriel	Understood.	1																					
31	31		301									Behind Gabriel, his hand briefly twitches before closing resolutely.

34	34		301								Gabriel	...My apologies, Miss Luna.	1																					
35	35		301								Gabriel	But—before we continue, I must be certain of one thing.	1																					
36	36		301									As Gabriel whispers his command, the Hetero-Creatures lurking by him suddenly launch toward Luna and strike.																						
37	37		301									Luna's minuscule figure is instantly swarmed by the frenzied crimson tide. Gabriel directs more monsters to attack her, then stands before the mad flood, like an audience enjoying a performance.																						
38	38		301								Gabriel	Please demonstrate to me with your action—that you are still the agent who holds absolute power.	1																					
39	39		201							1	500238	4																						
40	40		301							1	Luna	...Fine.	1																					
41	41		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Luna	If you're in doubt, let me demonstrate my will.	1
