4	4		301									Despite the shabby exterior, the residents have decorated the interior of the temporarily erected building to the best extent of their abilities.																						
5	5		301									All kinds of colored lights and ribbons hang from the rafters, wood panels pave the floor, and various flowers and plants are placed in every corner.																						
6	6		301									You can tell that people have high expectations for the celebration.																						
7	7		301									With activities in the exhibition as the highlight of the day, many people eagerly visit the stalls one after another.

9	9		301							1	Lucia	Is everyone here hoping to be the "Celebration Star"?	1																					
10	10		301									Lucia carefully observes the crowd as if sizing up the competition.																						
11	11		202							1					1																			
12	12		301									Aside from the stall owners, most of the visitors are children. Their eyes are beaming with excitement and curiosity. She notices the twinkling "stars" in their hands.																						
13	13		301									Those are what the stall owners are aiming for.																						
14	14		301									The stars cut from scraps of aluminum foil are referred to as "Star Tickets". They are how the "Celebration Star" is chosen.																						
15	15		301									Whoever collects the most of these special silver stars during today's celebration will be elected as the "Celebration Star" and receive a prize prepared by everyone in the conservation area.																						
16	16		301									Most of the booths in the exhibition hall were prepared for children in the conservation area. Children can select their favorite booths to give them Star Tickets.																						
17	17		301									Therefore, the biggest theme for this event is making the children happy so that the stall owners will be given their stars.																						
18	18		301									Even though it has nothing to do with "White Day"...																						
19	19		302								I see.	20																						
20	20		301									After careful observation, you see numerous booths with carnival games suited for two players so that both couples and groups of children can enjoy themselves.																						
21	21		201							1	500489																							
22	22		301							1	Lee	You're seriously interested in playing those games?	1																					
23	23		302								Ahem... Let's go to our booth first.	24																						
24	24		301									You point to a spot in the exhibition hall where four white circles are marked with chalk, and the names of the Gray Ravens are written on the edges.																						
25	25		201							1	500492																							
26	26		301							1	Liv	Did you prepare anything, Commandant...?	1																					
27	27		302								You could say that...	28																						
28	28		301									Your heart sinks a little at the thought. After all, you did not have much free time and energy to rehearse.																						
29	29		204							1	1																							
30	30		301								Liv	It'll be okay. After all, you said having fun is what counts, right?	1																					
31	31		201							1	500151	2																						
32	32		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Lucia	Then let's get started.	1

36	36		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						As time goes on, Gray Raven's performance begins to draw a crowd.																						
37	37		301									Lucia's performance is a blade dance.

39	39		502							RImgBg1BlowUp																								
40	40		301									Without any background music, only the noises in the venue are her accompaniment. Her bold yet beautiful movement is like a feather dropped by a passing bird.																						
41	41		301									Her blade technique is as refined and beautiful as ever. Her coating flows fluidly and nimbly, reflecting her heroism.																						
42	42		505							RImgBg1BlowUp																								
43	43		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					As several children step forward to see Lucia's blade more clearly, she slows her movements while keeping a safe distance from them.

47	47		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						As for Liv's performance...																						
48	48		502							RImgBg1BlowUp																								
49	49		301								Liv	"A young man came to a city where its golden apple trees no longer bore fruit. He told the citizens, 'if you drive away the mice that gnaw at the roots, you can once again harvest golden apples.' Hearing this, the citizens gave him lots of treasure as a reward..."																						
50	50		301								Liv	"The young man then approached the fountain, which had run dry. The guards asked for his help, to which he responded, 'if you drive away the toads beneath the stones, the fountain will once again flow with water.' Hearing this, the guards were very grateful to him and gave him two donkeys loaded with gold..."																						
51	51		301								Liv	"Finally, the young man returned home. When his wife saw him and heard of his great deeds, her happiness was to the moon and back.."																						
52	52		301								Liv	"From then on, they lived happily ever after..."																						
53	53		505							RImgBg1BlowUp																								
54	54		301									Sitting together with the children, Liv softly tells them a sweet fairytale. Unafraid of her, a little girl leans on her lap like a chick to its mother, letting Liv gently stroke her hair.																						
55	55		301									The children quietly wait for the next story, which seems at odds with the bustling venue.																						
56	56		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					But the most popular performance of all is...																						
57	57		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cg2701_13.jpg

59	59		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Child A	Wow! How did you do that, Mister?!																						
60	60		301								Child B	Yeah! Yeah! There's nothing up your sleeve!																						
61	61		301								Child C	And... and... where did the pigeon go?!																						
62	62		301								Child D	Do it again! Do it again! I wanna see it fly out again! It's amazing!																						
63	63		301								Lee	Watch closely...																						
64	64		502							RImgBg1BlowUp																								
65	65		301									First, Lee shows everyone the empty hat. Then, he reaches his hand into the hat, then suddenlyâ€”																						
66	66		301									Colorful ribbons and playing cards burst out from the hat!																						
67	67		301									He snaps his fingers again, and a small cloud of smoke bursts from his fingertips. The playing cards pass through the smoke and turn into candy as they fall to the ground.																						
68	68		505							RImgBg1BlowUp																								
69	69		301									As the children race to pick up the candy, Lee appears to relax a little.

72	72		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Right as you think that their performances seem to be a hit with the crowd, you feel someone tugging at your curtails.																						
73	73		201							1	500260																							
74	74		301							1	Girl	What are you performing?	1																					
75	75		301									Perhaps she is curious why you have only been standing in the corner, or maybe the Gray Raven's wonderful performances have raised her expectations.																						
76	76		301									Either way, the girl's eyes beam with anticipation as she pulls at your clothes.

82	82		201							1	500260																							
83	83		301							1	Girl	Well... Here, take this... Don't feel too bad about yourself...	1																					
84	84		301									The little girl shakes your hand in encouragement before putting three Star Tickets in your hand.

92	92		301								Lucia	I got twenty-two... It's okay Liv. We're a team. Our stars will be counted together.	2																					
93	93		301								Lee	Forty-five.	1																					
94	94		301									With such an amazing performance, you are not surprised Lee is able to get so many tickets.																						
95	95		301								Lucia	Commandant?	2																					
96	96		302								I...	97																						
97	97		301									You open your hand, revealing your Star Tickets.																						
98	98		302								Th-three...	99																						
99	99		301								Lucia	Huh?	2																					
100	100		301									Lucia is speechless as if completely caught by surprise.																						
101	101		301								Liv	M-maybe... your dance was too abstract for the children to really understand it.	3																					
102	102		302								...	103																						
103	103		301								Lucia	I thought your dance was wonderful, Commandant.	2																					
104	104		301								Lucia	It showed both strength and practicality. The final part where you were crawling and contorting your body was impeccable.	2																					
105	105		204							1	8																							
106	106		301								Lee	I wouldn't exactly call that "dancing"...	1																					
107	107		204							1																								
108	108		301								Liv	Anyway... enough about that. Has everyone thought about where they want to go next?	3																					
109	109		301								Lucia	Yes... I want to check out the market. Looks like there are more events for us to earn Star Tickets.	2																					
110	110		301								Lucia	Liv?	2																					
111	111		301								Liv	Oh, me? I'm not sure yet...	3																					
112	112		301								Lee	In terms of efficiency, splitting up is the fastest way to obtain more Star Tickets.	1																					
113	113		301								Lee	Choose whichever event best suits you.	1																					
114	114		302								Even then...	115																						
115	115		302								Just walking around and checking out the celebration is okay, too.	116																						
116	116		301								Liv	The commandant's right. How about we just take a break?	3																					
117	117		302								Alright, let's set a time to meet back up.	118
