4	4		301									Most of the World Government Association of Art's Constructs belong to the Archaeological Team, and have been nicknamed "donkeys" by the military's official Task Force.																						
5	5		301									This is because they are just like the 16th-century archaeologists who were embedded into the expeditionary armies, receiving the highest level of protection just like a donkey positioned in the center of an infantry formation.																						
6	6		301									The responsibility of the Archaeological Team is, as their name suggests, archaeology. In essence, they investigate humanity's ancient relics, retrieve them, and then repair them.																						
7	7		301									Selena has never had the opportunity to be in a frontal assault. The two operations she was on were simply to conduct simple investigations on an abandoned satellite nearby.																						
8	8		301									She seldom even gets to fight the Corrupted.																						
9	9		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					As such, she is understandably shocked when she gets her mission to investigate the space station.

12	12		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Allen	The space station's trajectory will bring it back into our orbit. The Task Force would like the Archaeological Team to take part in this mission and attempt to recycle as much space station data as possible during the battle.	1

19	19		301								Selena	Of course I am. I'm just a bit surprised. I thought I wasn't experienced enough to take part in such a large-scale operation.	2																					
20	20		301								Allen	No, you're experienced enough. Your missions have all been perfectly carried out so far. Few members of the WGAA's Archaeological Team can match your level of meticulousness and responsibility.	1																					
21	21		301								Allen	Besides, I know that you've always wanted to be on the front lines with the Task Force Constructs. This battle may be a good opportunity for growth and I'm hoping it'll give you more experience.	1																					
22	22		301								Selena	Thank you for your generosity, sir.	2																					
23	23		301								Allen	You're welcome. Oh, Selena, I'm curious about something... This may be a bit personal and offensive.	1																					
24	24		301								Selena	Please go ahead. I have nothing to hide.	2

28	28		301							1	Allen	Your opera once took Babylonia by storm and the WGAA thought highly of your career. There was no doubt you had real talent and skills.	1																					
29	29		301								Allen	You come from a wealthy family, and your future was incredibly bright. There was nothing compelling you to become a Construct.	1																					
30	30		301								Allen	So why did you become a Construct and join the Archaeological Team?	1																					
31	31		301								Allen	Don't get me wrong, members of the Archaeological Team can continue to engage in their previous pursuits. It's just that there are archaeological tasks to be performed regularly and so the amount of time you can spend on operas is much less than before.	1																					
32	32		301								Allen	I doubt you've given up the opera... You're not the fickle sort.	1																					
33	33		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Allen	So what was it that made you choose to pick up a weapon?	1

38	38		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						This should have been a completely simple archaeological operation. How did it end up like this?																						
39	39		301									While exploring the space station deeper, an Archaeology Team member accidentally unlocked the outer electromagnetic lock.																						
40	40		301									This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The Task Force Cpt has adjusted the battle objective immediately with the decision to probe further into the space station. After all, any information this space station may provide could become a key turning point in the war against the Punishing Virus.																						
41	41		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					They should have turned back on seeing the cross-shaped enemies.

45	45		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Unfortunately, hindsight is 20/20. They stumbled into the deepest area and learned the 'truth' behind the space station.																						
46	46		301									In the center of the gigantic circular space station is a geometric core giving off a faint blue light instead of the gravitational core. It has been going through a repetitive cycle of splitting and converging.

56	56		301									The blue geometric core makes a humming sound, as if it had just woken up. It slowly begins to convert its outer shell, like a beast that has become aware that there were trespassers on its territory.
