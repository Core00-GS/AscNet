6	6		301								Watanabe	Probably has something to do with the dual alarm system I found out. It's impossible to not trigger it at this stage.	1																					
7	7		301								Watanabe	Operating in the enemy's den means that there'll only be more and more guards I have to take down up ahead.	1																					
8	8		301								Watanabe	I don't think it'll take long before the alerted guards have me surrounded.	1																					
9	9		301								Watanabe	This defense strategy is like a pool of quicksand... Going to drag me to my death without me noticing.	1																					
10	10		301								Watanabe	Unless... I can slip inside without taking down any one of them.	1

14	14		301							1	Watanabe	Bianca is here... which means I have to beware of the Purifying Force as well.	1																					
15	15		301								Watanabe	Hold on... None of these guards can stand a chance against someone like her.	1																					
16	16		301								Watanabe	If I stay close behind her, they'll only go after her instead of me if the alarm goes off.	1																					
17	17		301								Watanabe	It's not honorable, sure, but in order to save my people...	1
