8	8		301							1	???	All right. That's it.	1																					
9	9		301									After getting rid of the manipulated puppets, Chrome and Kamui find themselves being confronted by a strangely-dressed figure.																						
10	10		301								???	...Why are you following me? And how did you get on the ship?	1																					
11	11		202							1					1																			
12	12		301									The mask-wearing Construct is the figure that Chrome was following. He seems to have the ability to control the performer puppets too.																						
13	13		301									Chrome sends Kamui a glance, and they both put their weapons down together.																						
14	14		201							1	500155	5																						
15	15		301							1	Chrome	We're the Strike Hawk Squad from Babylonia. I'm Chrome, and this is Kamui.	1																					
16	16		301								Chrome	We're here on the ship to seek intelligence, especially concerning AI systems.	1

19	19		301							1	Murray	Wait, why are you telling him everything?	1																					
20	21		301									Murray, who has been listening at the side, suddenly interrupts nervously, not understanding why Chrome did what he did.

26	26		301							1	Kamui	Because... the guy isn't giving off "killing intent".	2																					
27	27		301								Murray	Killing intent...?	1																					
28	28		301								Kamui	Yep. The will to kill! It's a kind of signal that Capt's specialized device can detect.	2																					
29	29		301								Kamui	To put it simply, we can tell that this guy ain't here for a brawl.	2																					
30	30		301									Replying in the place of Chrome is a grinning Kamui.

38	37		301							1		The masked man replies and extends his right hand to Chrome, who grips it in a firm shake.																						
39	38		301								???	You're not asking anything first?	1																					
40	39		301								Chrome	Can't lead a team if I can't handle a handshake.	2																					
41	40		301									The two, despite looking hostile before, seem to have come to a silent agreement. At least from Murray's perspective.

48	47		201							2	500155		400																					
49	48		301							1	???	Come to think of it, you've been in contact with someone, haven't you? Can you introduce this person to me?	1																					
50	49		301								Chrome	Of course. Murray, it's okay to share your communications with him, right?	2

54	53		301							1	Murray	Oh, well, yeah. I'll leave it up to you to decide.	1																					
55	54		301									Murray smiles, a bit resigned, and allows his visual system to be synced up with the masked man's.

58	57		301							1	???	I see now. An operator of sorts, huh.	1																					
59	58		301								Chaofeng	My name is Chaofeng. I'm one of the KCC Kowloong Crew.	1

61	60		201							2	500155		400																					
62	61		301							1	Chrome	So this ship is indeed owned by the KCC, huh?	2																					
63	62		301								Chaofeng	It used to be... but it's now fully under the control of the AI system you're looking for.	1																					
64	63		301								Chrome	Under the control of an AI...?	2																					
65	64		301								Chaofeng	The AI management system on the ship known as "Huaxu" was developed by the KCC. Huaxu is in charge of planning the ship itinerary and performing all kinds of missions.	1																					
66	65		301								Chaofeng	It's pretty much the "mastermind" of the whole ship. But something happened during the lengthy seafaring journeys...	1																					
67	66		301								Chaofeng	Huaxu shackled all the members on the vessel and implanted control codes directly, thus controlling the whole ship.	1

73	72		201							1	500144																							
74	73		301								Chaofeng	To become human. With its power, it forbade all from leaving the ship and re-planned the itinerary so that it would sail on forever, all to force people into finding a shell it could inhabit.	1

81	80		301							1	Chaofeng	Onto Constructs. Its first target was our leader, Qu...	1																					
82	81		301								Chrome	So she's now...	2																					
83	82		301								Chaofeng	She hasn't lost her body... but she became a marionette controlled by the system.	1																					
84	83		301								Chrome	So everyone's been basically stuck in an endless nightmare, with their every move controlled by that AI...	2																					
85	84		301								Chaofeng	Yeah. But today will be the end of this nightmare. Another Kowloong crew member and I have made plans to retrieve our leader, Qu.	1

93	92		301							1	Chaofeng	She has access to the main control room, where Huaxu's core lies.	1																					
94	93		301								Chrome	So you want to destroy Huaxu's core inside. Is that it?	2																					
95	94		301								Chaofeng	Yes. I can't directly attack Huaxu, as I'm under its control. But you can! And the ones we invited from somewhere else can too.	1																					
96	95		301								Chrome	So you already have help?	2																					
97	96		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Chaofeng	Yes, but we need all the help we can get.	1
