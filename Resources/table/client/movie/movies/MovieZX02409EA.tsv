4	4		301			DialogEnable						Why is the dragon above the sea?																						
5	5		301									Why isn't there the sound of the pipe? Is it drowned by the sound of waves?																						
6	6		301									There is no time to come up with answers.																						
7	7		301									The anchor has submitted to the storm. The evil dragon soars in the cloudy sky as if it is searching for something or running away from something. It twists its body and roars.																						
8	8		301									The sailor's shout is muffled by lightning and the dragon's roar. In this pouring rain, you can barely make out what he is saying by looking at how his lips move. And you try your best to hear what he is saying.																						
9	9		301									Lure... the dragon... the room... wood!																						
10	10		301									These fragmented words fail to piece together a meaningful sentence.																						
11	11		301									The sea is raging. The hull is tilted to the point that people can no longer stand on their feet. In a daze, you can faintly hear someone crying. Following that sound, you look in the direction of that room.

He uses one hand to hold a barrel and the other hand to maintain balance. Then, he throws the barrels into the ocean one by one.																						
13	13		301									You look around and realize the sailors are scattered all over the deck. But the farther they are from the room and the closer they are to the stern, the sailors open their arms more as if a banner.																						
14	14		301									Lure?																						
15	15		301									Suddenly, an idea comes to your mind. You have figured out what the sailor was saying.																						
16	16		301									You run to the stern. The floor is wet and the deck is tilted. You struggle to maintain your balance and have to rely on inertia to carry you forward.																						
17	17		301									The evil dragon swoops down as if it has locked on its target. It fast approaches you...
