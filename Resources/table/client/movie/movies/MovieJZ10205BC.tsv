4	3		301									Lucia turns to face the other way after confirming the direction. When she sees no trace of the Corrupted, she feels relieved and slows down.

22	21		301									Lucia barely held on to her blade as she stumbled across the city.																						
23	22		301									The extensive and intense fight has put Lucia's frame in critical condition, and it does not help that she is fighting without a Mind Beacon and M.I.N.D.

27	25		301									When her frame stops working, Lucia falls hard on the ground. The fall sends her weapon flying.																						
28	26		301									Lucia slowly crawls to her weapon, then holds it in her right hand and tries to get back on her feet by leaning on it.

35	33		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After some time, Lucia slowly opened her eyes. She found that she's not in the ruins of City 049, but the church she knew so well in her memory.																						
36	34		301									As Lucia raised her hands, she found they were not cold and mechanical with a bionic coating but were warm flesh... And she was able to say anything she wanted to say.																						
37	35		301									Suddenly Lucia felt something. She looked behind and saw a little girl holding an ugly frog doll talking to her. Her body automatically started a conversation with that girl.

45	43		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The girl goes farther and farther away from Lucia. Lucia wants to ask the girl what she said, but she cannot make any sound. The church then disappears, and Lucia plunges into the endless darkness again.

47	45		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						There was nothing but loneliness and emptiness in the dark. Suddenly, a cold touch was felt and the darkness faded. Lucia opened her eyes again.
