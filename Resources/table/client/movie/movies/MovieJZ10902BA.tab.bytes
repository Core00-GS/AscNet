26	26		301								Excited Voice	Huh‚Äî? How can you actually like this kind of stuff? I was wrong about you. We don't have the same taste after all!																						
27	27		301								Arrogant Voice	...I never said I had the same taste as you. This is a real masterpiece. Do you even understand art?																						
28	28		301								Excited Voice	Art? Art is all about being cool! The popularity is what really matters. You're just playing a game, nothing more! Are you out of your mind?

38	38		301								Meka	Many came here for the virtual games, but there are other hidden gems around.	2																					
39	39		301								Meka	A few years ago, when I last came, I watched a virtual theater play.	2																					
40	40		301								Ayla	Theater play? Do those still exist?	1																					
41	41		301								Meka	It was done in a very interesting way. I remember it was a story about Emperor Nero.	2																					
42	42		301								Ayla	I know! One of the books you brought me mentioned him. Emperor Nero loved arts!	1																					
43	43		301								Meka	Wow, you even know that... Virtual reality can be used in a lot more places, not just games.	2

67	67		301								Gentle Female Voice	There was a peaceful and prosperous kingdom. Like in a fairy tale, people lived in harmony with ample resources.																						
68	68		301								Gentle Female Voice	The king promised his people that all persons living on the land were equal, and had the right to pursue a good life.

78	78		301								Servant 2	Majesty, I fear the King has been shipwrecked on another island just as we have.
