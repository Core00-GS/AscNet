7	7		301								Kamui	...Oh?	1																					
8	8		301								Roland	I'm not building some Babylonia-ending w-weapon in this facility either.	2																					
9	9		301								Roland	So... if you stop here, I... I can let you go.	2																					
10	10		301								Kamui	Roland... Did I hear it right? Were you begging for mercy?	1																					
11	11		301								Roland	...Don't push it.	2

20	20		301								Kamui	The way you're acting means that this gold dust is making you desperate...	1																					
21	21		301								Kamui	Maybe the other Ascendants will also be affected by it. So, I'm taking you down this time.	1																					
22	22		301								Kamui	And then I'll pack some of this glitter for your friends before I take down the Ascendants once and for all!	1																					
23	23		301								Roland	You're not fighting fair. Do all of you Strike Hawks fight this dirty?	2
