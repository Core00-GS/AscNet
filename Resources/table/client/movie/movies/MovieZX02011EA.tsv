4	4		301									...It is not typical for you to say something like this, yet, for some reason, you cannot help but say it.																						
5	5		301									As if your soul has also been freed from that interrogation room, and you are standing with Cerberus here and now.																						
6	6		301									You can feel the exhilaration in your heart as it beats and your blood boils.																						
7	7		302								This is the true measure of a Chief!	8

24	24		301							1	Roland	That's not going to work.	1																					
25	25		301			RImgBg1Shake						No. 21 and Noctis are suddenly knocked back by an immense force one after another. Everyone loses their balance and drops their weapons, falling to the ground.

34	33		301									The man who fell to the side, defeated by Voodoo, stands up nonchalantly with a grin.																						
35	34		302								This clown!	36																						
36	36		301								Roland	Marvelous... How wonderful.	1																					
37	37		401							2	1516																							
38	38		301									Elegantly Roland steps up and takes off an invisible hat, bowing under the moon like a magician giving his curtain call.																						
39	39		301								Roland	Ta-da! The show is over!	1																					
40	40		301								Roland	What an opening act! You've saved me a lot of work, let me tell you that. As for the audience who tried to sneak in without a ticket... I think a little punishment is in order, no?	1																					
41	41		301									Roland does not bother to restrain Voodoo, who is no match for him now that Cerberus has worn him down. So he strolls to Voodoo and stands there, towering over him, and Voodoo's large frame looks unraveled in his shadow.																						
42	42		301								Roland	Now, can I have your ticket, please, ma'am?	1																					
43	43		201							1	500336	4

46	46		301									Voodoo raises her head and reveals the face behind her mechanical mask.																						
47	47		301								Voodoo	...Mr. Vonnegut will be very satisfied with your performance.	1																					
48	48		302								Vonnegut?	49	How are his footprints everywhere?	49

56	56		301									Roland takes out his gun and points it at Voodoo's shattered mask. They lower their voices.

61	61		301									Noctis wrestles to raise his voice.																						
62	62		301								Noctis	Where the hell did this Voodoo come from? And what the hell is this? You Mary Poppin' now, Roland? Enough with your magic tricks! Let me go, and we'll do it one-on-one—	1																					
63	63		301							1	No. 21	Noctis, you are loud.	2																					
64	64		301								Noctis	It's verbal assault, kid. I'm trying to get into his head with my words...	1																					
65	65		301							1	Vera	Both of you, shut up.	3																					
66	66		202							1	2	3			1																			
67	67		301									As Noctis is still struggling, Voodoo glances at you. She licks her metal arm before spreading her wings, and the jet engine underneath it launches her into the air...																						
68	68		301									Until she disappears at the top of the cliff.																						
69	69		201							1	500334	2																						
70	70		301							1	Roland	Interesting... Very interesting... Hahahaha!	1																					
71	71		301									Roland laughs. He holsters his gun and looks at you, seemingly knowing that you are connected to No. 21 at the moment. He stares at her, and she tenses up, growling.																						
72	72		302								21, calm down.	73																						
73	73		301								Roland	Interesting... Commandant, I'd love to see your face when you find out the truth...	1																					
74	74		301									...The truth?

90	90		301								Vera	...Heh.	3																					
91	91		302								...Did you just chuckle?	92																						
92	92		301									Vera cannot help herself but giggle. Even when her mobility is disabled, she still laughs like there is no tomorrow without a hint of having been just defeated.																						
93	93		301								Vera	Hahahahah—	3																					
94	94		301								Noctis	Don't tell me Vera has lost it... Has it been too much for her?	1																					
95	95		401							1	205																							
96	96		301								Vera	This is... oh my god... the true measure... hahahaha, of a Chief...	3																					
97	97		302								???	98																						
98	98		301								Vera	I've been holding it in—how the hell did you say that stupid line with a straight face?	3																					
99	99		301								Vera	The true measure of a Chief—	3																					
100	100		302								...	101	I got excited.	101

103	103		301								Noctis	...Heh, hahahahaha! I didn't even realize it!	1																					
104	104		301								No. 21	Why is it funny?	2																					
105	105		301								Noctis	You won't get it, kid.	1																					
106	106		301									Vera finally stops laughing, her mood seemingly unaffected by the outcome of the mission.																						
107	107		204							3																								
108	108		301								Vera	That said, not too bad for a comeback, Chief. Even for me.	3																					
109	109		301								Vera	You're making me more and more excited...	3																					
110	110		301									Roland's traps seem to have lost power by now. Vera is the first to break her invisible shackle.																						
111	111		302								That word Roland said back then...	112																						
112	112		204							1	4																							
113	113		301								Vera	Hmph, it's just a magnetic restraint device. He probably dropped it when we were dealing with Voodoo.	3																					
114	114		302								It's not the same thing he did in Venus Splash Park?	115																						
115	115		301								Vera	Just a trick.	3																					
116	116		301								Noctis	Hey, Vera, give me a hand!	1																					
117	117		301								Vera	Stay there like that, you loser. We wouldn't have gotten into this mess if you did your job correctly.	3																					
118	118		301								Noctis	You should've left the stakeout to 21!	1																					
119	119		301								Vera	Only losers make excuses.	3																					
120	120		202							1	2	3																						
121	121		301									The night breeze carries with it a constant buzz. Is that the sound of your blood...? No—it's an engine.																						
122	122		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Vera stands up straight and picks up her weapon. The wind stirs up her hair, and tiny raindrops linger on it. In the distance, a row of transport crafts slowly flies above the estate toward you.
