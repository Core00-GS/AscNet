11	11		301								Spooner	Why are you going this far?	2																					
12	12		301								Haicma	Our database has yet to record all human knowledge, Spooner.	1																					
13	13		301								Haicma	I believe fixing a hole after discovering it is the responsible thing to do.	1																					
14	14		301								Spooner	Then how about letting me help upload all these books?	2																					
15	15		301								Haicma	...	1																					
16	16		301								Haicma	Spooner, do you know how humans define a "miracle"?	1																					
17	17		301								Spooner	It's probably... an after-the-fact conclusion of an event that happened but is almost statistically impossible?	2																					
18	18		301								Haicma	What if that event keeps happening repeatedly, then?	1																					
19	19		301								Spooner	Then perhaps you should find a way to isolate it?	2

25	25		301								Haicma	You mean this area?	1																					
26	26		301								Spooner	I mean you, Haicma. I'm surprised by your changes, this shift that's unraveling the fundamental layer of your mindset.	2																					
27	27		301								Spooner	This will make you look... different to the church. I don't think those folks will ignore it.	2

33	33		301								Haicma	What?	1																					
34	34		301								Spooner	I'm afraid you might have to handle it here on your own for now.	2																					
35	35		301								Haicma	Sure, but where are you going?	1

38	38		301							1		Despite the vagueness, Spooner is not acting like it will be an armed encounter, so Haicma does not pry any further.																						
39	39		301									She is still in need of reference books she can use to decipher some human literature.																						
40	40		301									Just like how one would need to first understand programs before reading about artificial intelligence, there must be an entry point into understanding "miracles."

43	43		301									Wandering between the shelves, Haicma slowly amasses a large number of books she has to find. To understand them more comprehensively, Haicma has piled all the questions she has together.																						
44	44		301									But sometimes, not all questions have a definite answer.

67	67		301								Haicma	Still, you have shown up at the most opportune moment.	1																					
68	68		301									With that, Haicma hands you the book in her arms.																						
69	69		301								Haicma	I require the interpretation of a human regarding the information in this book.	1																					
70	70		302								What don't you understand?	71																						
71	71		301								Haicma	Based on my estimation—everything.	1																					
72	72		302								Then where should I start? The Big Bang?	73	It will take a while to go through the whole book.	73																				
73	73		301								Haicma	If possible. Please also summarize everything in the following books from the series.	1																					
74	74		302								...	75																						
75	75		301									So, you return to the bookshelves under Haicma's watchful eyes.																						
76	76		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You bite the bullet and head toward where she has been, hoping to find the other books in the series.																						
77	77		401							1	208																							
78	78		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Sitting down next to the shelf, Haicma turns to the first page of the book, and there it reads "Miracles" at the forefront.																						
79	79		301								Haicma	Does it mean I have to accept that "miracles" exist before I can continue reading this?	1																					
80	80		301									Her fingers gently touching the notes on the title page, Haicma looks through the gap in the bookshelf at the human whose figure just happens to overlap with the words.

84	84		301									Not only does her pile of questions remain unresolved, something else with a higher priority pushes it into a corner.																						
85	85		301								Haicma	It's similar... to what happened on the balcony?	1

92	92		301							1	Zero	You finally noticed! I thought you were ignoring me all this time.	2																					
93	93		301									Sitting on the two sides of the same bookshelf with their backs toward each other, Zero and Haicma talk at a volume only the two of them can hear.																						
94	94		301								Zero	You've gone rusty too, Haicma. Is it because of the humans?	2																					
95	95		301								Haicma	The church didn't tell me you're part of this operation.	1																					
96	96		301								Zero	I was in the neighborhood, and this place always seemed interesting to me. I thought it'd be a shame if I missed it.	2																					
97	97		301									Zero being interested in books? Even infected machines could not mutter something this nonsensical.																						
98	98		301									Recalling the "old friend" Spooner mentioned, Haicma fears that Zero is not the only one here.																						
99	99		301									As long as Haicma can keep an eye on the human's whereabouts...																						
100	100		301								Zero	Haicma, your mind has been running much slower lately. Has something contaminated your judgment?	2																					
101	101		204							2	5																							
102	102		301								Zero	If it's going to put Project Ark at risk, now's not too late to correct it.	2																					
103	103		301								Haicma	This library is under the control of the human conservation area.	1																					
104	104		204							2	2																							
105	105		301								Zero	It's not too hard to fry a human's brain. As long as we mush it thoroughly, there's no chance the other humans will be alerted in time.	2

147	147		301								Haicma	...	1

161	161		302								I'm glad I've run into you for the fourth time.	162																						
162	162		301								Haicma	...	1																					
163	163		301								Haicma	My theory is that you're only here because this is the only building in this area with a unique purpose.	1																					
164	164		301								Haicma	Hypothetically speaking, if this library did not exist, there is no way that a 0.08% chance could have...	1
