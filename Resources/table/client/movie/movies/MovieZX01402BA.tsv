5	4		301									After defeating the enemy, Rosetta proposed to join the others from Babylonia.																						
6	5		301									Rosetta walks... or rather, floats beside you as she speaks.																						
7	6		301								Rosetta	?	1																					
8	7		301									Noticing your gaze, Rosetta turns her head and looks over with a puzzled expression.																						
9	8		302								What happened to your centaur module?	9	Your light wings look nice.	3000																				
10	9	10	301								Rosetta	The centaur module... You Babylonia people sure like asking about that... Quite the opposite for the ARU.	1																					
11	10	11	301								Rosetta	I don't know the details, but that Asimov guy said Babylonia can't help with centaur modules.	1																					
12	11	14	301								Rosetta	Instead, they gave me this specially upgraded spear and shield. Just as effective though.	1																					
13	3000	12	204							1	6																							
14	12	13	301								Rosetta	...Thanks.	1																					
15	13	14	301									Rosetta seems to be blushing for some reason.																						
16	14		301								Rosetta	...Well, it might take a while before we can locate the crashed aircrafts. I'll tell you what happened here in the meantime.	1																					
17	15		301								Rosetta	As you know, the virus can't spread as well in the environment of the Arctic. People need only repel the occasional Corrupted and the "tide" to survive.	1																					
18	7001		302								The tide?	16																						
19	16		301								Rosetta	That's what the fishermen call them. They rise like the tide, posing danger intermittently.	1																					
20	17		301								Rosetta	We don't know why, but bionics appear around various areas throughout the ARU at this time to wreak havoc.	1																					
21	18		301								Rosetta	Sometimes they pose a serious threat, other times less so. Regardless, they never appear in the same spot twice once they've been quelled.	1																					
22	19		301								Rosetta	So when they requested reinforcements from Babylonia, I thought it was just business as usual. But after reading the report...	1																					
23	1001		204							1	8																							
24	20		301								Rosetta	I realized that this was different. The scale of this tide is unprecedented, as if they were trying to drown the ARU. The bionics attacked at a rate far beyond our imagination.	1																					
25	1002		302								Could someone be controlling them from behind?	21	Where are the bionics coming from?	22																				
26	21	23	301								Rosetta	From behind? No... that's impossible. The bionics have been at these brainless operations for quite some time now.	1																					
27	22	23	301								Rosetta	They're abandoned models from the ARU. But theoretically speaking, there shouldn't be so many after all this time.	1

35	28		301									While you were lost in thought, a man and a woman appear nearby, followed by a 6 seater snowmobile.

41	31		301								Atiel	My name is Atiel. Our original team is still recovering from their injuries, so it's just us. We sure are happy to see you, Boss!	2																					
42	32		301								Rosetta	Boss...?	1																					
43	33		301								Atiel	Oh, you haven't heard? 【kuroname】 was the top graduate of their year in commandant school. That's why Simon and his peers call 【kuroname】 boss.	2																					
44	1008		201							1	500201		-400																					
45	34		301							1	Simon	Let me introduce myself, would you?	1																					
46	35		301								Simon	The name's Simon, Commandant Simon. I was sent here to lead troops just like you, Boss... Sorry, I'm a little motion sick.	1																					
47	36		301									During his self-introduction, Simon held his head down as if in discomfort, while Atiel was like an overexcited bunny regarding you curiously.																						
48	1009		302								That was some time ago.	37	At your service.	38																				
49	37	1010	301								Atiel	No need to be so humble, Boss. You and your team sure made your mark on the field.	2

55	40		301								Simon	Got that right. We've been here for almost a week.	1																					
56	41		301								Rosetta	I see... Oh right. We were just looking for the other members that crash-landed.	3																					
57	42		301								Atiel	Oh, then you have nothing to worry about, Rosetta. Didn't you catch what I just said?	2																					
58	43		301								Rosetta	Huh?	3																					
59	1011		302								You found them already?	44	Are they alright?	45																				
60	44	46	301								Atiel	Real sharp, Boss. We've found the others already. Simon and I came here to rescue survivors after we saw the transport craft being shot down. You're the last search and rescue target.	2																					
61	45	46	301								Atiel	Yep! Just some minor bumps and bruises.	2																					
62	46		301								Simon	Atiel, let's hurry on back now that we've found them. It's not safe with just the four of us here.	1																					
63	47		301								Atiel	You're right. Boss, Rosetta, come with me. I'll take you to the ARU's commanding captain.	2
