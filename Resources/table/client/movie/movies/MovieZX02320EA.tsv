91	91		301							1		Despite knowing the danger, Chrome rejected Asimov's offer.																						
92	92		301									His reason was simple—the challenging situation would require a specialized frame.																						
93	93		301									That was not poor judgment. Chrome would not have made it until now had he changed back to the Arclight frame.																						
94	94		301									—Or was it when he decided to board the train?																						
95	95		301									Could he have avoided this hardship if he had led his team back to the conservation area earlier?																						
96	96		301								Chrome	Sure, but I never would've done it.	1																					
97	97		301									He knew full well that the danger this path posed would be more than he could bear. Still, all he has done is come up with more contingencies instead of returning to the safety of the conservation area.																						
98	98		301									That was a tough fight. If he were not there, there would be even fewer survivors.																						
99	99		301									Chrome would never put his own life over others.																						
100	100		301									Then there is only one answer—																						
101	101		301								Chrome	I made the right choice.	1																					
102	102		301									His right choices have led him here, bathed in crimson, surrounded by howls.
