7	889		302								Michael?	890																						
8	890		301								Kamui	He's from t-that movie... When did he start following us?	1

10	892		301							1	Lee	Right from the beginning. He showed no harm, so I didn't take action.	1																					
11	893		201							1	1081001																							
12	894		301							1	Kamui	I see... I thought this was "The Darkening", but it turned out to be "that movie"...	1

14	6		301								Kamui	Wow... Lucky I watched "that movie" without letting Capt know...	1																					
15	7		302								What's "that movie"?	8	Why not let him know?	10																				
16	8		301								Kamui	Oh, Wanshi got a movie...	1																					
17	9	11	301								Kamui	The name was "The Darkening". It was supposed to be a "horror movie," so Capt never let us play it in the preparation room...	1																					
18	10		301								Kamui	Um, this is only between the two of us... Capt thought the taste of that movie was "extremely poor," so he never allowed us to watch it...	1																					
19	11		301								Kamui	Plus, only the beginning was almost identical to "The Darkening", but the story was quite different...	1																					
20	12		301								Kamui	So I didn't recognize it until we got here.	1

23	15		301							1	Ayla	What's with this place?	2																					
24	16		301								Kamui	This is where the movie ended. The home of that scary killer with a mask.	1																					
25	17		301								Kamui	You know, the typical horror movie ending, where everything ends at where they begins.	1

27	19		301								Lee	I don't see any logic at all...	2

29	21		301							1	Liv	That's why you never watch horror movies, right? Lee?	1

33	25		301							1	Kamui	See, Commandant?	2																					
34	26		301								Kamui	Anyway, this is probably our only chance of beating that masked killer.	2																					
35	27		302								Alright... What should we do?	28	The only chance?	34																				
36	28		301								Kamui	That's the problem... I don't know.	2																					
37	29		301								Kamui	When Wanshi and I almost finished the movie... The file was corrupted.	2																					
38	30		204							2	2																							
39	31	38	301								Kamui	So I didn't get to see the ending.	2																					
40	32		302								Alright... What should we do?	36																						
41	33		204							2																								
42	34		301								Kamui	Right. According to the movie's background, the killer is only mortal inside this house.	2																					
43	35	32	301								Kamui	Which means we can only kill him within the house.	2																					
44	36		301								Kamui	That's the problem... I don't know.	2																					
45	37		301								Kamui	When Wanshi and I almost finished the movie... The file was corrupted.	2

47	39		301								Narration	You suddenly hear a squeaking sound from behind. Someone is trying to break through the door.																						
48	40		301								Narration	You also notice a few silhouettes not far ahead.																						
49	41		301								Narration	You can choose to ask someone for help, but their response may not be in your best interest.																						
50	42		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Narration	You only have one chance. The squeaking sound has stopped, which means the killer is already behind your back.
