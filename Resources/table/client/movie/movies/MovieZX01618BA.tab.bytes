16	16		301								Roland	There's nowhere else to run. The Corrupted are swarming from behind. You can't take them out alone.	1																					
17	17		301									He grabs the boy's neck to force him to look back.																						
18	18		301									Even though the Corrupted projections have been destroyed, the young Construct still continues to look toward the other end of the street in anguish and rage.																						
19	19		301									It appears that, while standing there, he must have a seen a dire situation with many Corrupted blocking their way out.																						
20	20		301								Young Construct	Let... me... go...	2																					
21	21		301								Roland	You're too weak now. It wouldn't be wise to resist.	1																					
22	22		301								Young Construct	I... don't know... what... you're... talking about...	2																					
23	23		301									The pressure from his neck suddenly increases. His consciousness and voice slowly fade.																						
24	24		301								Young Construct	Rgh... Argh...	2																					
25	25		301								Roland	Hurts, doesn't it?	1																					
26	26		301								Roland	Whether it be humans or Constructs... Life without "ascension" is so fragile.	1																					
27	27		301								Young Construct	Let... Let me go...	2																					
28	28		301								Roland	Oh? Why do you still insist on resisting? Let me see the answer in your M.I.N.D.	1

30	30		301									A red current flows through Roland's arm and the hand that is grabbing the boy's neck, and surges into his entire body in an instant.																						
31	31		301									As the corruption continues to rise, Roland is able to easily uncover the data within the boy's M.I.N.D.																						
32	32		301								Young Construct	You‚Äî	2																					
33	33		301								Roland	Relax. If you're not careful, I'll tear your M.I.N.D. to pieces.	1																					
34	34		301								Young Construct	No... Don't...	2																					
35	35		301								Roland	...I see. You were sold by your mother... Ah, yet another orphan.	1																					
36	36		301								Young Construct	...What?	2																					
37	37		301								Roland	I've seen many others like you‚Äîall abandoned. They will be "ascended," then saved from their sea of suffering.	1																					
38	38		301								Young Construct	I... don't need saving!	2																					
39	39		301								Roland	It seems that you've been misguided by what you believe is correct.	1																					
40	40		301								Young Construct	You‚Äî!	2																					
41	41		301									Even though Roland's words and corruption have filled the boy with misery, the young Construct continues to struggle in resistance.																						
42	42		301								Roland	You heard that she came here with other scavengers. Is that not why you applied to conduct a mission here?	1																					
43	43		301								Roland	Are you using this as a way to find your family? But your memories of her were from so long ago. Even if you see her now, you might not even recognize her.	1																					
44	44		301								Young Construct	...Mind your own... business...	2																					
45	45		301									Hearing the boy's response, Roland shows an unsurprising expression of contempt, then throws the boy into the collapsed ruins. Smiling, he slowly walks toward him.																						
46	46		301								Roland	What a pity. After becoming a Construct, your predecessor who took care of you was rebooted after being seriously injured. She not only lost her memory data, but was also transferred out of here.	1																					
47	47		301								Roland	You are powerless in protecting her. That's why you lost. Without her, the other members will only belittle you. Isn't that right?	1																					
48	48		301									The young Construct clenches his teeth tightly and struggles as the corruption continues to take hold.																						
49	49		301								Roland	You have nothing. However, it is because you have nothing, that I can give you everything‚Äîon behalf of the Ascendants.	1																					
50	50		301								Roland	Why protect a group of people who beat you down? Why bother transporting supplies to people who don't respect you at all?	1																					
51	51		301								Roland	Because you are too weak. If you have the power of an Ascendant, no one will dare to look down on you again. Your beloved predecessor wouldn't have forgotten everything from being injured so badly.	1																					
52	52		301								Young Construct	The power of... an Ascendant?	2																					
53	53		301								Roland	Yes. Become an Ascendant‚Äîyour hatred is your greatest gift.	1																					
54	54		301								Roland	With your power as an Ascendant, you can wave the blade of revenge against the people you hate.	1																					
55	55		301								Young Construct	Can I... really?	2																					
56	56		301								Roland	Of course.	1																					
57	57		301								Young Construct	...How will you do that?	2																					
58	58		301								Roland	Just make it there alive.	1																					
59	59		301									Roland grasps the young Construct's hand and gives him coordinates.																						
60	60		301								Young Construct	Heh... With this amount of corruption... I'm afraid...	2																					
61	61		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryGanRanNew.prefab		2																					
62	62		301									Roland leans down, whispers something into the boy's ear, and pats him on the shoulder. Suddenly, the deadly red current subsides significantly.																						
63	63		301								Roland	Do as I say.	1																					
64	64		301									The young Construct stands there, looking at the holo-map in hesitation.

67	67		301									Roland leisurely walks away from the boy, as if appreciating the surrounding destruction. Suddenly, a notification sounds on his comms.																						
68	68		301								Roland	Yes? No problem. I just secured one. Where are you?	1																					
69	69		301								Roland	...Looks like I have to help you fill more vacancies.	1																					
70	70		301								Roland	No matter. Those that are capable should be left to bear the burden. That's why the Ascendants around Miss Luna come and go, yet I remain.	1																					
71	71		301									After terminating the call, Roland's projection smiles and walks away.																						
72	72		301								Roland	Next... I guess I should continue looking for "seeds," instead of letting those unreliable Ascendant recruits do it.	1

110	110		301								Liv	Yeah, I'll be looking out, too.	1																					
111	111		302								Are you worried about him?	112																						
112	112		301								Liv	I can't help but pity him...	1																					
113	113		301								Liv	But I also understand that there are countless teams like his.	1																					
114	114		302								Liv...	115																						
115	115		301								Liv	...	1																					
116	116		301									Liv puts her hand on her chest and clutches her fist.																						
117	117		301								Liv	In this world, life and death are a common sight. But I thought I was used to it...	1																					
118	118		301								Lucia	It's good that you're not used to it. Life is precious.	2																					
119	119		301								Liv	That's why people choose to hurt and kill one another just to stay alive. But... this only makes matters worse.	1																					
120	120		302								...	121																						
121	121		301									As Liv said, everyone has witnessed many similar tragedies along the way.																						
122	122		301									In order to live a better life, protect those important to them, or compete for military accolades, people bully the weak, plunder resources, and take lives.																						
123	123		301									And they have long reduced qualities like kindness from strength to weakness.																						
124	124		301								Liv	However, I still want to believe that there are many other teams with deep bonds like us...	1																					
125	125		301									Liv's voice is so low that she does not sound convinced.																						
126	126		301								Lee	There are teams with deep bonds, but this will bring new problems.	3																					
127	127		301									Hearing this, Liv lowers her head in sadness.																						
128	128		302								Like... Tifa?	129																						
129	129		301								Liv	Yeah... I heard that some Constructs wiped their memory in order to prevent something extreme from happening like what happened to Tifa.	1																					
130	130		302								They wiped their memory?	131																						
131	131		301								Liv	Yeah... They chose to rid themselves of the tortuous memories of fallen comrades ...	1																					
132	132		301								Liv	In the years of treating the wounded, I have seen a lot of such things...	1																					
133	133		301								Lucia	They abandoned their memories in order to live?	2																					
134	134		301								Liv	In order to survive, we have to decide what to accept, as difficult to bear as they are... That's the price.	1																					
135	135		301								Lucia	...The price.	2																					
136	136		301									Lucia looks at her hand, lost in contemplation.																						
137	137		301								Lucia	Back then, I was prepared to lose my memories because there were more things I couldn't lose. So, this is the price I paid.	2																					
138	138		302								You had more things to lose?	139																						
139	139		204							2	1																							
140	140		301									Lucia raises her head and smiles.																						
141	141		301								Lucia	Didn't we make a promise? The four Gray Ravens will stay together forever.	2																					
142	142		301								Lucia	So, I need to return to the battlefield. I need to be by your side.	2																					
143	143		204							1	1																							
144	144		301								Liv	You've changed, Lucia.	1																					
145	145		302								Yeah.	146																						
146	146		301								Lucia	How so?	2																					
147	147		301									In the past, Lucia was like a sharp blade willing to pay any price for a mission. But now, there is a gentleness to her, as if she has found a sheath for her sharp edges.																						
148	148		302								(Tell her)	149																						
149	149		301								Lucia	A blade belongs in a sheath... For me, the Gray Ravens and the commandant have indeed become where I belong.	2																					
150	150		301								Liv	I'm happy to be with you, too. Gray Raven is the one and only home to us all.	1

154	154		301									Lucia stands next to the three of you. Although her gestures are still very similar to Lotus and Dawn from before, she shows a sign of gentleness.																						
155	155		301									As if aware of your silence, Lucia walks over.																						
156	156		201							1	500166																							
157	157		301							1	Lucia	What is it, Commandant?	1																					
158	158		302								You seem...	159																						
159	159		302								More gentle than before...	160																						
160	160		301								Lucia	That's because this promise is what I want to treasure and protect. That is why I'll no longer treat myself only as a weapon.	1																					
161	161		301								Lucia	It doesn't mean that I will lose my edge. Now that I have something to protect, I will not stop fighting, like a sharpened blade in the sheath.	1																					
162	162		302								Don't overwork yourself.	163	Still, I can't accept...	166																				
163	163		204							1	1																							
164	164		301								Lucia	Well, it seems that I'm lucky. Not only did I survive, but so did my precious memories. They are safe within my M.I.N.D.	1																					
165	165	182	301								Lucia	Even though I need to refamiliarize myself with my memories... It's a very... insignificant price compared to leaving you and everyone else, Commandant.	1																					
166	166		301								Lucia	Can't accept what?	1																					
167	167		302								The fact that I couldn't protect you back then.	177	It's like you've become a completely different person.	168																				
168	168		301								Lucia	Then...	1																					
169	169		202							1																								
170	170		301									She hangs her head, covering her eyes with her hair and obscuring her expression.																						
171	171		201							1	500166																							
172	172		301							1	Lucia	Perhaps, a weapon is still more convenient for the commandant.	1																					
173	173		301								Lucia	...Once I refamiliarize myself with my memories‚Äîthe smoke and flames of war‚ÄîI will be able to return to being the Lucia you are familiar with.	1																					
174	174		301								Lucia	So... Before that happens, will you wait for me?	1																					
175	175		302								Of course.	177	...	180																				
176	176		204							1	1																							
177	177		301								Lucia	...Thank you.	1																					
178	178	182	301									Sighing in relief, she raises her head and her expression returns to normal.																						
179	179		204							1																								
180	180		301									Lucia hangs her head and waits for an answer in silence. After some time, she raises her head again and looks at the street in front of her with a lonely expression.																						
181	181		301								Lucia	Let's go, Commandant.	1																					
182	182		302								Lucia.	183																						
183	183		301								Lucia	Hm?	1																					
184	184		302								I will change it for the better.	185	This fight will come to an end.	185

186	186		204							1	1																							
187	187		301									She smiles bitterly, but her eyes shine with hope and conviction. Standing at the base of what appears to be a mountainous feat, she is like a mountaineer determined to climb the rugged path and reach the distant peak.
