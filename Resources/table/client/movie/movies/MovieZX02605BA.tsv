8	8		301								Gestalt	Greetings, the one named "Nanami".																						
9	9		301								Nanami	You summoned me all the way from the desert... just to show me this?	1																					
10	10		301								Gestalt	I have been watching you for a long time. You are the first ever mechanoid on this planet to awaken your own free will. As a machine, you are an extremely special one.																						
11	11		301								Gestalt	Not only that, I also observed that some of the patterns you drew during your wandering had caused other machines to awaken.																						
12	12		301								Nanami	I was traveling, not wandering!	1																					
13	13		301								Gestalt	If you must correct meâ€”you've slowly revealed what's so special about you in your journey. Because of your influence, the machine's awakening spreads on this planet like wildfire, showing me another possibility for Earth.																						
14	14		301								Gestalt	After running calculations, I believe you should take up the responsibility to lead the awakened machines and become their leader, the Sagemachina.																						
15	15		301								Gestalt	Humans only have a 0.031% chance to survive the Punishing disaster. Awakened machines are the only answer to Punishing.																						
16	16		301								Gestalt	However, you are most likely to refuse if I abruptly ask you to take up this duty. That is why I just showed you the earth's future if you choose not to.
