15	15		301							1	Lucia	Commandant, can people who aren't romantically involved exchange gifts on White Day?	1																					
16	16		301									Lucia asks you, perhaps because the scene before her seems to be different than what she was told when she first came here.																						
17	17		302								Long ago, maybe not. But now...	18																						
18	18		301									They are just using the holiday as a chance to express their gratitude, even though they could do that normally...																						
19	19		302								But special days will give different meanings to the same actions.	20																						
20	20		301									Hearing this, Lucia looks at the happy face of a man.																						
21	21		201							1	500152																							
22	22		301							1	Lucia	It's a pity I didn't prepare a gift for you and everyone else.	1																					
23	23		301									She gives a sigh of regret.																						
24	24		302								It's not too late. Some vendors haven't packed up yet.	25																						
25	25		302								You still have a chance to choose gifts.	26																						
26	26		301								Lucia	Shouldn't gifts be made by hand?	1																					
27	27		302								It's the thought that counts.	28																						
28	28		302								Choosing a gift can be just as thoughtful.	29																						
29	29		301								Lucia	...	1

31	31		301								Lucia	Understood. In that case, we need to hurry, Commandant.	1

37	37		301									Before you can finish speaking, you hear a thunderous explosion behind you. Lucia pulls you behind her instinctively and grabs the hilt of her blade.																						
38	38		301									You smell a sweet and greasy aroma in the air. People laugh jokingly at you two.

40	40		302								?	41																						
41	41		301									Based on the calm crowd around you and the lack of fireworks, you realize it must be...																						
42	42		302								Popcorn?	43																						
43	43		301									Looking over, you see a black cylinder with a pressure gauge and various valves. Golden, puffy kernels fill the black cylinder, their sweet smell floating along the breeze.																						
44	44		301									You noticed the device earlier, but you didn't realize it was for making popcorn.																						
45	45		301									After paying with a few pieces of hardtack, the person operating the machine retrieves a tub of popcorn.																						
46	46		301									Looks like you can make your own.

48	48		301							1	Lucia	That's it.	1																					
49	49		302								Huh?	50																						
50	50		301									Lucia's eyes fix on the popcorn machine with the desire to give it a try.																						
51	51		301								Lucia	This will be my gift to everyone.	1																					
52	52		302								...	53																						
53	53		302								You can pay with this.	54																						
54	54		301									Constructs don't need to eat, so they rarely carry food or drinks. Fortunately, you grabbed some in case of emergency before departure.																						
55	55		301								Lucia	I won't disappoint you this time.	1
