10	10		301							1	Realm Guardian	How did you enter this city?	1																					
11	11		301									Holding onto his sword, Realm Guardian slowly gets on his feet. He does not seem to have given up the idea of expunging the players yet.																						
12	12		302								Through the city gate.	13	I'm pretty good at picking locks.	13																				
13	13		301								Realm Guardian	He's got to be kidding me. Why is he still letting people in? Are all the rocks so stubborn like him?	1																					
14	14		301									I can't think of any other stubborn rocks.																						
15	15		301								Realm Guardian	The Ancient Triangle. Where did you get the key...? Oh, the Sage's seal in the capital. That's the only place I cannot neutralize.	1

22	22		301							1	Realm Guardian	...The Realm of Dragons has lost its former glory. Everybody has either left or disappeared. I'm the only one left in this city.	1																					
23	23		301									Realm Guardian struggles to stand up. His majestic body and weapon have become one.																						
24	24		301								Realm Guardian	They spent a lot of effort establishing this city. I will protect this place no matter what.	1																					
25	25		301								Realm Guardian	Leave, heroes. There is no gold or treasure in the Realm of Dragons now. It is not worth your time and effort.	1

34	34		301							1	Liv	Why do we have to take something? We traveled so long to get here. Are you saying this journey is only a price we must pay for the treasure?	1

48	47		301								Liv	Mr. Guardian, do you remember a group of heroes who once came to the Realm of Dragons? Among them was a wizard who liked to cover his own face.	1

50	49		201							1	500169																							
51	50		301							1	Realm Guardian	A group of heroes? The wizard covering his face? Of course I remember them. That guy took away the last gold coin in the Realm of Dragons.	1

55	54		301							1	Lee	He left with almost nothing. We met him not long ago.	1																					
56	55		301									Liv takes out the bottle of Sleepy Fog, while Lee waves the strange short staff with a teleport spell inside.																						
57	56		301								Lee	He gave us these to thank our help. He also asked us to pass a message.	1

68	67		301							1	Liv	Mr. Guardian, it is true that our journey ends at the Realm of Dragons.	1																					
69	68		301								Liv	You can call our effort to retrieve the treasure of the Realm of Dragons ridiculous, but please don't deny our time spent together. That is the most precious experience and cannot be measured with anything else.	1

77	76		301							1		Liv did not answer but exchanged a look with other Gray Raven members. They all nod together.																						
78	77		301								Mr. Door	See, I told you. You care about the results too much.

83	82		301			RImgBg1Shake						A gigantic stone disc thunders down the hill, making an even louder bang.																						
84	83		301			RImgBg1Shake						After crashing through a fence and a wooden banner, he finally ends up in the collapsed wall, with his face upside down. He looks back at the trail he left.																						
85	84		301								Mr. Door	Oops, that was a few meters off. I can only give that an 8.																						
86	85		201							1	500169																							
87	86		301							1		Realm Guardian looks bitterly at the mess, wishing he could wield Mr. Door into the crack he left.																						
88	87		301								Realm Guardian	I'll turn you into a wall if you ever do this again!	1																					
89	88		301								Mr. Door	Relax, you have plenty of time. I think the heroes have a point. Don't get too hung up on the Realm of Dragons.																						
90	89		301								Realm Guardian	They built this city from scratch. This is the legend that all adventurers long for. Can you really watch all of this become a joke?	1																					
91	90		202							1					1

93	92		301							1	Liv	Um... Mr. Guardian.	1																					
94	93		301								Liv	That wizard didn't tell anyone the actual situation in the Realm of Dragons.	1																					
95	94		301								Liv	I think he also wants the search for the Realm of Dragons to last forever, so more people will meet their friends and embark on this journey together.	1																					
96	95		301								Mr. Door	I guarded the entrance to the Realm of Dragons for so many years.																						
97	96		301								Mr. Door	But I had never seen anyone abandon their friend because of that stupid "one triangle for one person only" rule.																						
98	97		202							1					1																			
99	98		201							1	500169																							
100	99		301							1	Realm Guardian	Is that why you are away from your position?	1																					
101	100		301								Mr. Door	I was built to hold off the hostility from outside, not to stop the people inside from going out.																						
102	101		301								Realm Guardian	...	1																					
103	102		301								Mr. Door	Experience the outside world. Look at it with your own eyes.																						
104	103		301								Mr. Door	If someone is willing to stay, just let them stay as long as they have passed my check. This place doesn't have to end even if we are no longer around.

106	105		201							1	1031001	1																						
107	106		301							1	Liv	This city may have declined, but I'm sure it will soon be revitalized upon the arrival of new friends.	1

110	109		301							1	Realm Guardian	...You really got me a big task.	1																					
111	110		301								Realm Guardian	...Whatever.	1																					
112	111		301									Realm Guardian throws something to Liv.																						
113	112		301								Realm Guardian	You win. Take this as a souvenir. Don't put it in a temple like others.	1

122	121		201							1	500169																							
123	122		301							1	Realm Guardian	...Since when does it have such a function? Why have I never heard of that?	1																					
124	123		301									If that's the case, the monsters didn't attack in the past because...																						
125	124		301									Realm Guardian scratches his head, trying to recall something.																						
126	125		301								Realm Guardian	From what I can recall, the people who lived there were busy building a temple to hold the souvenirs they brought from the Realm of Dragons. For years, they stopped expanding their territory and left the monsters undisturbed.	1																					
127	126		301								Realm Guardian	Naturally, the monsters didn't go to them for revenge.	1
