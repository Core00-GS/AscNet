4	4		301								Chrome	My visual module is being hacked...!																						
5	5		301								Vonnegut	Oh? Is that all?																						
6	6		301									Suddenly, numerous ear-piercing alarms begin to buzz in his ears.																						
7	7		301									"Memory deviation at 31.217%."... "Record erased."																						
8	8		301								Vonnegut	Listen to the fear in your heart.																						
9	9		301								???	I used to respect that guy, but now he's just a useless tool.																						
10	10		301									...Establishing simulation link...																						
11	11		301									Memory deviation at 30.316%.																						
12	12		301								???	Place him on the front line! He can recall if he dies!																						
13	13		301									Record erased.																						
14	14		301									...Establishing simulation link...																						
15	15		301								???	By the look of it... The Chief is no longer Langston.																						
16	16		301									Record erased.

19	19		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Chrome's field of vision gradually returns amid the frenzy of alarms. He suddenly finds himself before a red warning screen.																						
20	20		301									It is not so much fear as it is disgust engraved in his memories.																						
21	21		301								John	"Smith" had long been perfected. I brought you back as my son to make you a Smith and become the perfect "me."																						
22	22		301								Chrome	No... It's not like that...																						
23	23		301								John	Langston, as my son, you know what to do. Don't you?																						
24	24		301								Chrome	I've already broken free from my shackles.																						
25	25		301								???	You are a failure. Nothing you have ever done has surmounted to anything. It's always been like that.																						
26	26		301								Chrome	No, I've already gotten what matters the most...																						
27	27		301								???	The agent will crush your teammates one by one... Those you respect will be framed and put to death... And you are powerless...																						
28	28		301									Ignoring the ear-piercing noise, Chrome quietly grabs his weapon.																						
29	29		301								???	You want to protect them? You want to protect those who are doomed to abandon you?																						
30	30		301								???	Constructs are only seen as a convenient tool. You saw for yourself...																						
31	31		301								???	The moment you became a Construct, you became a loser.																						
32	32		301								???	You'll never be the Chief. You'll never be a true commandant. Now, you are only... a tool.																						
33	33		301									Doubt, undeniable doubt. This doubt has persisted in his heart over countless missions and battles, like a cobweb forming in the corner of a wall. Now, this doubt has become amplified and restless by some unknown power.																						
34	34		301									A bolt of lightning carrying Chrome's conviction, shatters the darkness before him, silencing the cacophony. Slowly, his M.I.N.D. begins to stabilize—																						
35	35		301									—Only for warning alerts to immediately start buzzing again. Chrome's field of vision fills with contorted streaks of vibrant red.																						
36	36		301									A familiar pain bites at his nerves, rippling throughout his entire body.																						
37	37		301									WARNING! Memory overload. WARNING! Memory overload. WARNING! Memory overload. WARNING! Memory overload. WARNING! Memory overload.																						
38	38		301								???	You are worthless. You failed to live up to your father's expectations. How dare you even call him "Dad"?																						
39	39		301									Chrome waves his scythe at the shapeless onslaught of noise once more.																						
40	40		301									Firm denial, unbearable pain. Everything seems to be ridiculing his choices again and again.																						
41	41		301									The detestable but all too familiar memories stab at his fingertips. All of the nerve endings in his entire body begin to fire in rhythm. Each breath feels as if knives are carving out his bones.																						
42	42		301								???	There is nothing at the end of the road you have chosen.																						
43	43		301			RImgBg1Shake	DialogDisable					—With an agonizing breath, another bolt of lightning shatters the darkness and steels his conviction.

48	48		301			DialogEnable					???	...																						
49	49		301									The ground begins to rumble slightly as if someone is laughing nearby.																						
50	50		301								Chrome	As long as I disable my visual and audio modules, there's no way for you to hack me.																						
51	51		301									Even though intuition is guiding his judgement, Chrome is resolute in his decision.																						
52	52		301								???	...																						
53	53		301									The ground begins to rumble again as if the person laughing had taken a few steps closer.																						
54	54		301									An invisible coercive force quickly approaches from the left. As for what the force is, it is the gust of wind from a blade.																						
55	55		301									—CLANG!																						
56	56		301									Chrome's scythe collides with metal. The violent impact sends vibrations through his palms, numbing his knuckles.																						
57	57		301									With his usual resilience, Chrome would typically be unfazed by the pain from such intense vibrations.																						
58	58		301									However, with his visual and audio modules disabled, there was only one method to maintain his agility in combat—																						
59	59		301									—Improve the sensitivity of all modules in his perception cluster, even if it will cause severe pain. No... Pain is necessary to maintain M.I.N.D. stability with his visual and audio modules disabled.																						
60	60		301									Gusts of frigid wind attack from the left and right. Chrome turns to dodge the attack from the left while using his scythe to block the blade approaching from the right.																						
61	61		301								Chrome	...Got you!																						
62	62		301									Right as Chrome finds an opening, he charges his scythe with lightning and strikes in the direction of the wind.																						
63	63		301								Chrome	Bullseye!																						
64	64		301									Even though he has clearly landed a blow, there is no sense of struggle or pain typical of being stabbed. Instead, the enemy remains motionless like a stalwart wall.																						
65	65		301								Chrome	A wall? Is this... a defense barrier?!																						
66	66		301								???	...																						
67	67		301									Someone answers from the point of impact. Despite being unable to hear what is said, he can sense the subtle vibration from the sound.																						
68	68		301									He wants to retreat, but his weapon is held in place by a mysterious force. Suddenly, Chrome feels the crushing sensation of being choked.																						
69	69		301									He feels as if his body is being corrupted by the Punishing Virus, which intensifies the magnitude of pain as if he is being skinned alive.																						
70	70		301									Still, Chrome continues to struggle alone in the darkness.																						
71	71		301								Chrome	...I can't...																						
72	72		301									He grips his weapon tightly. Even though he feels the searing pain of his broken knuckles, he has lost all perception of his hands.																						
73	73		301									Regaining control of his weapon, Chrome unleashes an all-out attack at the enemy choking him!																						
74	74		301									Right as the blade connects with the enemy, the figure releases Chrome and takes several steps back.																						
75	75		301									Although he escapes the enemy's vice grip, Chrome is temporarily stunlocked due to the agonizing pain and corruption.																						
76	76		301									Just before he senses the subtle vibration of the opponent's footsteps approaching again, someone with high Punishing corruption quickly ambushes the enemy from behind.																						
77	77		301									Giving himself no time to catch his breath, Chrome uses this opportunity to turn and search for his teammates.																						
78	78		301								Chrome	Kamui... Wanshi...																						
79	79		301									He still remembers their general position before blacking out. After fumbling along his memory for a few steps, a quivering breath brushes against his broken fingertips on the left.																						
80	80		301								??	...																						
81	81		301								Chrome	Who's there...? Wanshi...?																						
82	82		301									Feeling his face, Chrome is vaguely able to recognize the contour of Wanshi's face.																						
83	83		301									Chrome grabs his shoulders and senses Wanshi trying to open the buttoned-up pocket of his tactical bag.																						
84	84		301									...What is Wanshi seeing?																						
85	85		301									Drowning in the hallucination, Chrome no longer is able to exert control over his body. Still, he struggles to take out the contents of his carrying bag. Perhaps, it will be of some use to Wanshi.																						
86	86		301									Chrome fumbles to help him open the intricate series of buttons on his carrying bag.																						
87	87		301									...If they get out of here alive, Chrome is going to request an easier bag to open for Wanshi first thing.																						
88	88		301									Just as this trivial thought comes to mind, the vibrations from the two people fighting gradually disappear. Instead, they are replaced by an earthquake-like rumble from underneath the lift.																						
89	89		301									The individual who had ambushed the enemy from behind approaches him, then stops nearby.																						
90	90		301								Chrome	...Camu?																						
91	91		301								??	...																						
92	92		301									The rumbling from below grows in intensity. Even if there is still risk of being hacked, Chrome does not hesitate to activate the previously disabled modules.

97	97		301									With vision and hearing gradually restored, Chrome looks around to see Kamui, who normally has a sunny disposition, wearing a look of agonizing pain.																						
98	98		301								Kamui	Koya... Koya!!																						
99	99		201							1	500175	5																						
100	100		301							1	Camu	Kamui, you damn troglodyte! Wake the hell up!	1																					
101	101		301			RImgBg1Shake						Seeing that Kamui is still unconscious, Camu slams his fists on his chest. Still not fully awake, Camu gives him a swift kick in the pants.																						
102	102		301									Just now waking up, Wanshi sits up feebly and looks at Kamui anxiously. He is still grasping an empty syringe with trembling hands, which he had just taken out of the open carrying bag.																						
103	103		201							1	500273	7																						
104	104		301							1	Wanshi	...Does he have any painful memories?	1

108	108		301									Kamui is shaken awake by Camu. He rubs his dizzy eyes, leaving traces of pain on his face.

110	110		301							1	Kamui	...Koya...	1																					
111	111		202							1					1																			
112	112		301									Seeing the dark waterway in front of him, Kamui realizes that he was hallucinating just now. He stands up and gives a cheery, untimely smile to Camu, who returns the look with a grimace.																						
113	113		201							1	1081001	2																						
114	114		301							1	Kamui	When did you get here?	1

118	118		301								Kamui	Oh... I don't know why, but I found myself trapped playing a level I was stuck on for a month.	1

130	129		301									But after reflecting on his hallucination, his smile quickly fades.																						
131	130		301								Kamui	No... It was...	1																					
132	131		301									Seeing Kamui wake up, Chrome breathes a heavy sigh of relief, then adjusts the sensitivity of his perception module back to normal. Even still, the trauma and pain he experienced in the dark had far exceeded the limit of what most people could endure.																						
133	132		301								Kamui	...Wait, where is that guy?	1																					
134	133		202							1	2				1

143	142		301									The four of them quickly run to the exit, but at this speed, sooner or later, they will be surrounded by the Red Tide and the Hetero-Creatures occupying the waterway.
