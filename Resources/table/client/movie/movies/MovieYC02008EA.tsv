3	3		301			DialogEnable						He follows the clueless girl while she searches around. Roland has already inspected the place thoroughly, but she seems to be able to see things that he cannot.																						
4	4		301									Interesting. Is the information only visible... to those that meet all the criteria? Roland feels like he is getting close.																						
5	5		301									After a series of seemingly pointless searching and relocating, the girl linking to the Commandant of Gray Raven runs downstairs.																						
6	6		301									But Roland is not rushing to follow. He is not keen to be a good stage actor that follows the script.																						
7	7		301									Especially when the stage is not going to award him just for putting up a good performance. There is a complicated plan behind all this.																						
8	8		301									Both he and the Task Force linked to Gray Raven Commandant are just a part of the plan.																						
9	9		301									The strange behaviors of the Construct named No. 21 can be probably attributed to this plan.																						
10	10		301									Meanwhile, No. 21 and Roland are also being set up by the third party. No matter how they managed to gather so much complicated information, Roland has to give them credit.																						
11	11		301									Roland has no choice but to follow their script step by step.																						
12	12		301									Roland has already seen what No. 21 has seen... But those things aren't going to tell him where Luna is now.																						
13	13		301									They are nothing but some miscellaneous items that could potentially come from Luna's childhood.																						
14	14		301									Roland doesn't know what the third party wants from the connection between her and the Commandant of Gray Raven.																						
15	15		301									—But it has nothing to do with "this house."																						
16	16		301									Maybe No. 21 and Gray Raven Commandant will eventually find out what they and Roland both want to know, but that will never be revealed to Roland and the person who set him up.																						
17	17		301									—But if whoever sets Roland up knows what Babylonia and Roland want to know from the beginning, and tries to communicate this through their plan...																						
18	18		301									Tsk, this is making me mad.

25	25		301								Roland	At least it tells me one thing...	1																					
26	26		301								Roland	...Whoever set this up knows who I am, and knows exactly what I want. They expect me to follow the script till the end.	1

76	76		301									Roland knows Lamia could possibly run away, but he has not expected her to leave so soon.																						
77	77		301									But the absence of a sidekick does not matter. As long as all the protagonists have arrived, the show must go on.																						
78	78		301									Whether Lamia can be of help or not, Roland will still go meet the person behind all this. "No" is not an option.
