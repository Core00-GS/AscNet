5	5		301									—Unable to see where she is going.																						
6	6		301									—Where should she go?																						
7	7		301									Darkness. Fear. Loneliness.																						
8	8		301									—Just like countless times before.																						
9	9		201							1	500214

13	13		301									—But how should she protect them?																						
14	14		301									—Who is there to guide a knight?																						
15	15		201							1	500214																							
16	16		301							1	Rosetta	What should I do?	1																					
17	17		301									—Only by sharpening one's blade and growing stronger can one protect everyone.																						
18	18		301									Phweeee—																						
19	19		301									This time, it is not her whistle. Rather, it is a familiar sound she hears in the snowy forest.																						
20	20		301								Rosetta	There you are.	1																					
21	21		301								Rosetta	Hurry, let's go back. It's too dangerous being here on the mountain in this kind of weather.	1																					
22	22		202							1					1																			
23	23		301									Rosetta quickly walks toward the CUB. She grabs it by the rein and turns to go back.																						
24	24		301									However...																						
25	25		201							1	500214																							
26	26		301								Rosetta	Huh? Where did I just come from?	1																					
27	27		301									The blizzard has already covered her tracks. Any potential markers are lost in the flurry. Right now, they are surrounded by infinite darkness cast by the violent snowstorm.																						
28	28		301								Rosetta	Regardless, we have to get off the mountain first.	1																					
29	29		202							1					1																			
30	30		301			RImgBg1Shake						However, Rosetta stumbles onto the ground after just a few steps.																						
31	31		301									Even as a Construct, she finds that her mobility in such treacherous weather has become greatly hindered.																						
32	32		301									Rosetta tries to stand up with the help of her spear, but the snowstorm throws her to the ground once more.																						
33	33		301									But just as she is about to fall into the snow, a sturdy strength suddenly rises from beneath her.																						
34	34		201							1	500214																							
35	35		301							1	Rosetta	What are you...	1																					
36	36		201							1	500332																							
37	37		301							1		Without receiving any orders, the CUB catches her fall and tosses her on its back.																						
38	38		301									This sudden move, however, causes Rosetta's spear to collide with the CUB's body.																						
39	39		301									Despite receiving quite a number of scratches from the spear, the CUB pays no mind. After firmly placing Rosetta on its back, it takes a few steps forward.																						
40	40		301									Rosetta can sense clearly that the CUB is moving at such a slow pace from having to carry her exhausted frame.																						
41	41		201							1	500214																							
42	42		301							1	Rosetta	Enough. We'll both be stuck here at this rate.	1																					
43	43		301								Rosetta	Now's not the time to be capricious. If you keep this up, you'll...	1																					
44	44		301									—Expire.																						
45	45		301									However, Rosetta cannot say that word out loud.																						
46	46		201							1	500332																							
47	47		301							1		The CUB ignores Rosetta's order and continues to carry her through the blizzard, unyielding.																						
48	48		201							1	500214																							
49	49		301							1	Rosetta	Why...	1																					
50	50		301								Rosetta	Why do you still carry me when you know what might happen?	1																					
51	51		201							1	500332																							
52	52		401							1	36																							
53	53		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1		Darkness gradually invades Rosetta's vision as she closes her eyes. In the last gleam of light, she sees the CUB by her side in the harsh blizzard.

58	58		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						While the dim light around her just manages to illuminate the road, all light eventually diminishes. Rosetta has to feel her way through the darkness alone.																						
59	59		301									Rosetta always knows that she does not have the best luck.																						
60	60		301									She brings trouble and misfortune to her comrades. If her comrades continue onward with her, they will only be met with pain.																						
61	61		301									That was why she chose to face Alpha by herself back then. Why she has to bring an end to the Corrupted alone.																						
62	62		301									Perhaps, none of her comrades will be hurt because of her anymore when they no longer stand at her side in harm's way.																						
63	63		301									That is why she must take the helm. That is why she must fight with every fiber of her being. Anything to protect her comrades.																						
64	64		301									It does not matter if such lengths are excessive. As far as Rosetta is concerned, this is all she can do.																						
65	65		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					But...

71	71		201							1	500332																							
72	72		301							1		Suddenly waking up, Rosetta finds herself still riding on the CUB, but the snowstorm has subsided significantly.																						
73	73		301									Gradually, she is able to identify a few familiar landmarks and realizes that the CUB is moving toward the camp.																						
74	74		301									Despite being covered in snow, the CUB continues to trudge onward while trying to shelter Rosetta from the storm.																						
75	75		201							1	500214																							
76	76		301							1	Rosetta	You're still here...	1																					
77	77		301									Rosetta reaches forward to touch its cold, metallic body. Her fingertips feel a faint sense of warmth.																						
78	78		502						200	PanelActor1Shake																								
79	79		505							PanelActor1Shake																								
80	80		301									Suddenly, she notices a faint trembling. However, this is not from the cold but something far more terrifying—the snow mountain is rumbling.																						
81	81		301									Looking back, she sees a destructive tide of snow tumbling down from the mountaintop.																						
82	82		301									The trees and stones along the way are submerged in an instant.																						
83	83		301									An avalanche.																						
84	84		301									Rosetta pushes herself up, but all she can do is sit on the back of the CUB. As if noticing the approaching danger, the CUB launches into a full-on sprint.																						
85	85		301									But no matter the speed, the avalanche is gaining on them.																						
86	86		301								Rosetta	At least it can...	1																					
87	87		502						400	PanelActor1Shake																								
88	88		505							PanelActor1Shake																								
89	89		301									Rosetta is about to leap off the CUB, but right as she prepares to jump, the CUB lowers its center of gravity and interrupts Rosetta.																						
90	90		204							1	5																							
91	91		301								Rosetta	What are you doing?! We'll both get caught in the avalanche!	1																					
92	92		502						400	PanelActor1Shake																								
93	93		505							PanelActor1Shake																								
94	94		301									Rosetta tries to jump again—only to be stopped by the CUB once more. She has no choice but to stay on its back.

99	99		301									Rosetta stares at the impending disaster behind her and suddenly feels as if time begins to slow down.																						
100	100		301									Quickly scanning her surroundings, she realizes that they are approaching the gorge she struggled to cross when pursuing the CUB.																						
101	101		301									With the cliff already right before their eyes, she should be able to easily clear such a wide berth with the CUB's help in a single bound.																						
102	102		301									However, the avalanche is already overhead before they can reach the other side.																						
103	103		301								Rosetta	You really are... stubborn as a mule.	1

107	107		301									Right as the avalanche is about to engulf Rosetta and the CUB, they are overcome with momentary silence.																						
108	108		301									Rosetta and the CUB, the impending disaster, the roaring blizzard—all become quiet.																						
109	109		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryLouDianNew.prefab	2																							
110	110		301			RImgBg1Shake						Suddenly, the deafening silence is broken by a bright beam from her electromagnetic blast.

116	116		301									The silent, slow progression of time returns to normal amid the thunderous roar of the avalanche.																						
117	117		301									With that, Rosetta and the CUB breathe a sigh of relief.																						
118	118		301									The CUB lands safely on the other side of the gorge. Rosetta sits up and looks back to see the avalanche continuing to surge down the cliff. The CUB gently rears up on its hind legs, then continues down the mountain.																						
119	119		201							1	500214																							
120	120		301							1	Rosetta	We made it out all thanks to you.	1																					
121	121		301									Hearing this, the CUB shakes its head.																						
122	122		301								Rosetta	You mean... it wasn't just you?	1																					
123	123		301								Rosetta	You and I... together?	1																					
124	124		301									The CUB refrains from answering and continues onward silently. Rosetta places a hand on its crest. This time, she does not sense the same fierce resistance as before.																						
125	125		301								Rosetta	I see...	1																					
126	126		202							1					1																			
127	127		301									—So that is how it is.																						
128	128		301									—To guard is not just to give. Sometimes you need to take.																						
129	129		301									—It is not refusing help and carrying the burden alone.																						
130	130		301									—Rather, it is understanding and accepting each other.																						
131	131		301									—It is having each other's backs and relying on each other for support, guarding each other against the wind and rain, and protecting what you share.																						
132	132		301									—A guardian also needs to be protected, too.																						
133	133		201							1	500214																							
134	134		301							1	Rosetta	Neither of us would've escaped that disaster on our own.	1																					
135	135		301								Rosetta	We worked together so that neither of us would perish...	1																					
136	136		301									—There is no need to walk alone. The future requires understanding and acceptance. It requires everyone to walk side-by-side.																						
137	137		301								Rosetta	In the past... Not only did I never think of it, but I also refused the help of others.	1																					
138	138		204							1	1																							
139	139		301								Rosetta	Thank you for being so stubborn. You've taught me something new.	1
