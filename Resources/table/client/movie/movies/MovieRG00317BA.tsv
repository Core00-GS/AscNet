10	9	1001	301							1	Lucia	We are underneath the Demon General's Castle. I'm so glad that you are awake, Commandant.	1																					
11	10	1001	301									This place looked like an underground facility. Lucia and others looked happy and relieved.

13	11		301							1	Kamui	Hehe, I was so scared just now. Didn't expect this game to have the bleeding feature. You wouldn't have survived without Karenina's recovery potions.	1																					
14	1002		302								Karenina?	12	The potions they collected all along...	13																				
15	12	1003	301								Kamui	Yeah, two of you dropped from above. Don't you remember?	1																					
16	13	1003	301								Kamui	So you really were collecting the potions... The villagers thought we were bad guys because of that.	1																					
17	1003		201							1	500180																							
18	14		301							1	Karenina	Whatever, now that the Commandant of Gray Raven is awake, can we leave this place already?	1																					
19	15		301									Karenina walked out of darkness and looked at Lucia. She seemed to be quite upset.

22	16		301							1	Lucia	Before taking action, we need to at least explain the situation to Commandant, like why we were here, and what happened.	2																					
23	17		301								Karenina	What a hassle.	1																					
24	18		301								Lucia	Commandant, you just woke up, so you may feel a little weak. You only need to listen.	2																					
25	19		301								Lucia	First of all, just like you expected, we had a fight with the King.	2																					
26	20		301								Lucia	But somehow our attacks didn't work at all. At the most crucial moment, we saw two of you falling down from the castle.	2																					
27	21		301								Lucia	...As well as some bombs left by Camu and Vera.	2																					
28	22		301								Karenina	Those two would do anything just to win...	1																					
29	1006		201							2	1081001		-400																					
30	23		301							1	Kamui	And you said you wanted to finish us off at the spawn point! You aren't any different!	2																					
31	24		301								Karenina	I don't do cheap shots!	1

34	25		301							1	Lee	Those bombs seemed to be taken off Demons. Anyway, they landed before the King's attack, so the land blocks all collapsed, and we ended up here.	1																					
35	26		301								Lee	The bleeding was also from falling. But now you should be fine.	1																					
36	2001		302								Did anyone come after us?	27	What were Vera and Camu thinking...	28																				
37	27	29	301								Lee	Not yet, but the King probably knows we are here. We can't stay long.	1																					
38	2002		201							1	500180	5																						
39	28	29	301							1	Karenina	Who knows what those two maniacs were thinking? I'm so going to beat them up next time I see them.	1																					
40	2003		201							1	500166																							
41	29		301							1	Lucia	Anyway, a lot of things are still unknown. Commandant, we may belong to different teams, but I think we should move together.	1																					
42	2004		302								Yeah.	30	Let's move.	30																				
43	30		301								System	【kuroname】 has joined the team.
