40	39		301								Lee	Perhaps, this city... is an experimental facility set up to enable mechanoids to become "self-aware" enough to resist its rules...	2																					
41	40		301								Lee	But we infiltrated the facility and thus inadvertently introduced variables that altered the results of the experiment.	2																					
42	41		301								Lee	If so... then the original intention of this facility may be to screen out the "Embla" that is capable enough to fight "Machiavelli".	2																					
43	42		301								Lucia	In other words, our actions have left behind this "Embla", who wouldn't stand a chance against "Machiavelli", causing the purpose of this facility... to fail?	1
