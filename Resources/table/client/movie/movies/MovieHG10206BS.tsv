4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Lucia	Commandant, you're here.	1																					
5	133		302								Kept you waiting?	5	When did you get here?	6																				
6	5	7	301								Lucia	No. I don't mind waiting if it's you.	1																					
7	6	7	301								Lucia	A few hours ago. I didn't know when you would arrive, so I came early, just in case.	1																					
8	7		301								Lucia	But enough about that. Let's return to our date. The reason I've invited you here is because my recovery has reached an end.	1																					
9	8		301								Lucia	Through exhaustive reviews of prior files, I've ascertained the kind of person I am, and what I must do.	1																					
10	134		302								And what kind of person is that?	9	What must you do?	10																				
11	9	11	301								Lucia	A fairly playful girl, Commandant.	1																					
12	10	11	301								Lucia	The thing I'm about to do.	1																					
13	11		301								Lucia	Sit down next to me first. I prepared a sumptuous meal for you.	1																					
14	12		301									Halfway through the sentence, Lucia seems to change into a different person. Her voice lightens, and her smile turns softer than usual.																						
15	13		301								Lucia	Strange, isn't it? You won't see this side of me often. Relaxing moments like these are hard to come by, after all.	1																					
16	14		301									At Lucia's insistence, you take the utensils and sit down on a mat draped on the coarse ground.																						
17	132		302								You made this, Lucia?	15	(Eat death)	16																				
18	15	17	301								Lucia	...As much as I would like to say "yes", I left it up to the support staff, in the interest of your health.	1																					
19	16	17	301								Lucia	It should be good. I didn't get to taste-test, but I trust the chefs.	1																					
20	17		301									While you eat, you listen to Lucia talk at length about current events.																						
21	18		301									Once, you were worried about her turning into a different person after the procedure. But from her words and actions, the new Lucia is simply a little more "playful."																						
22	19		301								Lucia	...	1																					
23	20		301									As the moon rises high, Lucia suddenly goes quiet, her eyes closing as if in prayer.																						
24	121		302								What are you doing?	21	Are you tired?	22																				
25	21	200	301								Lucia	I'm summoning the aliens, Commandant. Want to join in?	1																					
26	22	200	301								Lucia	No, I'm just trying to summon aliens. With telepathy.	1																					
27	200		302								Aliens?	520																						
28	520		401							1	207																							
29	23		301								Lucia	Mh-hm. I mean, extraterrestrial cultures...	1																					
30	24		301								Lucia	My records indicate that you once had a conversation with Qu, the leader of Kowloong.	1																					
31	25		301								Lucia	She once said that Tabula Akasha was all about leaving traces of humanity behind, letting "travelers" know we were once here... I think by "travelers", she must have meant aliens.	1																					
32	26		301								Lucia	I may not be a big fan of this plan, but I do think it's amazing that there might be other cultures, other beings, out there.	1																					
33	27		301								Lucia	Don't you think so too, Commandant? If "others" really do exist in the universe, what would they look like?	1																					
34	28		301								Lucia	But no matter what they look like, if they can reach us through the void of space, that would mean that their technology far outstrips ours...	1																					
35	29		301								Lucia	If that's the case, they may have a way of stopping, maybe even eradicating the Punishing Virus.	1																					
36	223		302								That would be nice.	30	Maybe even they can't do it.	31																				
37	30	32	301								Lucia	Yes, indeed it would be.	1																					
38	31	32	301								Lucia	...Then that would be catastrophic. Aliens infected with the Punishing Virus would be no joke.	1																					
39	32		301								Lucia	But aliens are probably just wishful thinking, both for Qu and for us...	1																					
40	231243		204							1	6																							
41	33		301								Lucia	If you want something, you have to reach for it. Fight for it. For me, for you, for all of us.	1																					
42	34		301									You suddenly feel Lucia's embrace from behind.																						
43	35		301								Lucia	Though I may never be myself again, I think this is how "Lucia" expresses her emotions.	1																					
44	36		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	So, just like this... let me be with you, Commandant.	1
