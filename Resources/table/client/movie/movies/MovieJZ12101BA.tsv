6	6		401							1	209																							
7	7		301									She hears the lyrics, "Put your head on my shoulder. Whisper in my ear, baby." playing through the speaker. It only plays this one line; no more, no less.																						
8	8		301									At 7 o'clock, she finishes washing up and is spared a brief moment of silence.																						
9	9		301									At this time, she normally just sits on the only chair in the room, waiting for her designated Medic Bot to administer her routine physical and injections.																						
10	10		301									She looks at the white Medic Bot in silence. The Medic Bot will flash one of three colors depending on her examination results. Green means "Safe", orange means "Standby", and red means "Danger".																						
11	11		301									These colors were the only colors she could see in the pure white confines of the room, thereby making the Medic Bot seem all the more peculiar.																						
12	12		401							2	1515																							
13	13		301								Medic Bot	...Ding!																						
14	14		301									Today, the color is green. She is free to leave.																						
15	15		301									The holo-screen displays her schedule for the day. But does it really matter? Each day is merely a repetition of the previous day—the same schedule she has seen countless times.																						
16	16		301									At 8 o'clock, staff at the research institute begin their work. No. 21's room is at the end of the corridor, so few people pass by the glass wall. She watches the staff clad in white lab coats, awaiting the one assigned to her room.																						
17	17		401							2	1507																							
18	18		301									At 8:30, she hears the locking mechanism activate and the massive white door slide open. A staff member in a white lab coat walks in.

27	27		301							1	Staff Member	I have some news for you. Your modification surgery has been moved up to today. Your Tantalum-193 affinity will be re-evaluated at 9 o'clock, and the surgery will begin at 10 o'clock.	2																					
28	28		301								No. 21	...Moved up? Why?	1																					
29	29		301									Her response catches the staff member off guard. No. 21 normally just obeys quietly.																						
30	30		301								Staff Member	Test Subject No. 20 had some... Um, forget it. It has nothing to do with you.	2																					
31	31		301									She stops herself mid-sentence, realizing she should not say too much. Instead, the staff member just replies vaguely.

37	37		301									The staff member hands her a collar. Whenever No. 21 leaves the room, she must always wear the restraint collar on her neck, even during combat training. When the collar turns bright red, she experiences severe pain and numbness radiating from it.																						
38	38		202							1	2				1																			
39	39		301									No. 21 has worn this ever since she was a child. There were a few times she put up a fight, but it has long since become an everyday part of her life.

50	50		301									Has it started?																						
51	51		301									No. 21 is no stranger to this kind of surgery. During her stay at the institute, she has undergone them numerous times.

74	74		301								No. 21	The Medic Bot.	1																					
75	75		301								???	Oh, right. You have a Medic Bot unlike the others. Is it because of your poor health?	2																					
76	76		301								No. 21	(Nods) ...I haven't passed.	1																					
77	77		301								???	That's okay! I saw your recent training results. You killed it! I wanna be strong like you... Once we're modded, we can get the heck outta here!	2																					
78	78		301								No. 21	...Leave? Here?	1																					
79	79		301								???	Yup! No. 13 left last week after he completed his modification surgery. I heard some grown-ups say he's already going on missions.	2																					
80	80		301								No. 21	Oh...	1																					
81	81		301								???	What's wrong? You don't wanna stay here, do you?	2																					
82	82		301								No. 21	I don't know. Is there any difference between doing experiments out there and here?	1																					
83	83		301								???	Obviously, DUH! I saw the outside world before I was brought in. It's completely different from here... Er... It's hard to describe, though. It's been so long, I can't really remember... BUT! I'm sure it'll blow your mind when you see it!	2																					
84	84		301									No. 20 sits cross-legged in front of No. 21. Unlike the other test subjects, she came from "outside."																						
85	85		301									The researchers do not like No. 20 speaking with the other test subjects, but she always finds a way to sneak off with No. 21.																						
86	86		301								No. 20	Hehe... But based on our numbers, looks like I'll be modded before you. When I get out, I'll be waiting for you!	2																					
87	87		301								No. 21	Why do you want to wait for me?	1																					
88	88		301								No. 20	Because... we're friends, silly!	2																					
89	89		301								No. 21	Friends?	1																					
90	90		301								No. 20	Sigh. The other kids are just as scatterbrained as you, but you're the only one that doesn't get mad at me. And besides, don't we talk a lot? I think that makes us friends.	2

94	94		301								No. 20	Let's make a pact. You're my first friend, and I'm your first friend. How does that sound?	2																					
95	95		301									She ignores No. 21's confusion and continues to speak her mind, but No. 21 is used to it. Based on her analysis, No. 20 is safe and non-threatening. Not to mention, no one ever talks to No. 21 besides her. So, she nods in agreement.	2																					
96	96		301								No. 21	Okay.	1																					
97	97		301								No. 20	Awesome!	2																					
98	98		301									No. 20 jumps on her in excitement and rubs her hair. But right after, No. 20 curls up in her arms and whimpers.																						
99	99		301								No. 20	Dang it... Sniff... They found out I'm missing.	2

101	101		301								No. 20	Ouuuch... Ow! Ow! Ow! I need to get going!	2																					
102	102		301									The girl staggers to her feet, puts her hand over the restraint collar on her neck, and spits her tongue out at No. 21 even though the pain causes her to wince slightly.

110	110		301									Born as a test subject, her duty is to undergo experimentation, fight in combat training, and wait for the next experiment. Her future is like the list on the holo-screen in her room, written out long ago.

137	137		301								???	Just recover the target without making a scene and I'm sure you can do it and just call me if you need anything and I'll be on standby and bye.

152	152		301									The operating room is empty. Apparatuses and surgical instruments are knocked over. An intravenous tube hangs from a scattered array of racks and supports. Blood and vital fluids drip from a damaged tube, forming an immiscible pool on the floor.

165	165		301									No. 21 takes a moment to acclimate to the pain. The effects of anesthesia still have not subsided, causing her to feel dizzy. After several attempts to raise her hand, she finally manages to pull off the respirator covering her face.																						
166	166		301									Taking off the respirator obstructing her vision, she sees a hand—a robotic hand. Surprised by the unfamiliar sight, she tries to move her fingers, and the doll-like spherical joints move.																						
167	167		301									This is her body. She strains herself to look down, gasping for breath from the unprecedented confusion and panic.																						
168	168		301									Her body has become a mechanical frame—but it is not complete. She can see her joints... Her legs are embedded with iron plates, with gaps between them, revealing the internal structure of thin wires and luminous chips.

181	181		301									However, No. 21 does not stop. One by one, the wires connected to her begin to sever. Her metal frame drags across the floor, making a sharp grating sound, as shards of glass scratch at her frame.

188	188		301								No. 21	...I musn't... be discarded...

227	227		301									After who knows how long, she hears the crisp sound of footsteps coming from behind...																						
228	228		301								??	...Is that all I could grab?																						
229	229		301								??	Not satisfied with my work? Hm?																						
230	230		301									The sound approaches from afar, stopping beside her.																						
231	231		301								??	No other Construct in Kurono could've gotten half as much as what I did.																						
232	232		301								??	The Daedalus branch has been completely wiped out. If you want any intel, go get it yourself. I'm too lazy to go digging through this dump.																						
233	233		301								???	WIPED OUT?! By a single Construct?! How'd you...																						
234	234		401							2	1516																							
235	235		301									She terminates the transmission, stopping the babbling noise.																						
236	236		301									Right at that moment, the Medic Bot's last bar of energy depletes. The tube connecting it with No. 21 convulses, no longer injecting any fluid.																						
237	237		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					In a blur of consciousness, No. 21 feels a pair of hands lifting her shoulders.

240	240		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						She struggles to open her eyes. This time, No. 21 clearly sees her face—a face she has never seen before.																						
241	241		301									She has never seen such a vibrant color.

243	243		301							1		Her hair and eyes are a fiery red.																						
244	244		301									She picks up No. 21 like a doll, lays her out flat, then stops her "blood loss" with surgical precision.																						
245	245		301								No. 21	...Are you...																						
246	246		301									No. 21 opens her mouth to speak. Her voice is wispy and delicate like gossamer. She remembers a story No. 20 told her about a mythical being that shines radiantly and brings salvation in times of danger.																						
247	247		301								No. 21	...Are you... an angel?																						
248	248		301									Hearing No. 21's question, the red-haired woman sneers at such a preposterous question.																						
249	249		301									She approaches her and forcefully closes the wound on her chest. Compared with the pain she had just endured, No. 21 only winces slightly.																						
250	250		301									The sound of music can be heard playing in the institute.																						
251	251		301									"Put your head on my shoulder. Whisper in my ear, baby."																						
252	252		301									This is a reminder to all test subjects that it is now 4 o'clock. Time for them to assemble for their afternoon round of experiments to collect data.

257	257		301								??	I'm the devil... here to take you back to hell.	1																					
258	258		301								??	That's enough. Rest, and welcome aboard the train to hell. When you wake up, you'll arrive at your destination.	1																					
259	259		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					This is the last thing No. 21 hears before losing consciousness.
