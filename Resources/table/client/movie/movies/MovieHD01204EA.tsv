14	14		301								Lee	I have checked inside and found no threat.	2																					
15	15		301								Lee	But there wasn't any hint either.	2																					
16	16		302								Maybe it needs all of us to be present?	17	Shall we check somewhere else?	18																				
17	17	19	301								Lee	I have also considered that possibility.	2																					
18	18		301								Lee	But Tiger just wouldn't leave the room.	2

23	23		301			DialogEnable						The building has four rooms, all fully furnished. A line of arcade machines sit in the living room. Tiger is sitting on them, taking a nap.																						
24	24		301									There are a few apples in the basket on the coffee table. The apples seem to be freshly washed as there are still water drops on them.																						
25	25		301									Based on past experience, if this is the right place, some hint would suddenly show up.																						
26	26		301									For example, a notice board that protrudes from the ground, a voice that appears in our mind, or even an NPC with a yellow exclamation mark on top...																						
27	27		301									But none of them has happened. After everyone has entered the building, Tiger has not scanned anything but remained on the arcade, unwilling to get up.																						
28	28		301									Severe stomach cramps hit you as you struggle to find any clue. You feel like all your internal organs have been emptied from the abdomen, or replaced with ice.

34	34		302								It is Nanami's interference.	35																						
35	35		301									You contributed a lot in the "dust and clean" operation, but the energy consumed should not have caused this situation.																						
36	36		301									"Grumble—"																						
37	37		301									You hear another extended grumble, but not from your body.
