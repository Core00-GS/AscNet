3	3		301			DialogEnable						On the spacious Kowloong observation deck, a beautiful Female Construct is playing the guqin, an eastern string instrument. The music sounds melodious but cold.																						
4	4		301									You have been invited here, but you are unsure of Qu's intent.																						
5	5		201							1	500150																							
6	6		301							1	Qu	Oh, you're here.	1																					
7	7		302								...	8																						
8	8		301								Qu	Why do you look so surprised?	1																					
9	9		302								What exactly did your message mean?	10																						
10	10		301								Qu	I said that our "partnership" would end here.	1																					
11	11		302								What for?	12																						
12	12		301									Qu stands up quietly and walks to the center of the observation deck.																						
13	13		301								Qu	Do you remember this place?	1																					
14	14		301									This is where the decisive battle was fought in the Kowloong war—where you fought Qu .																						
15	15		302								How could I forget?	16																						
16	16		301								Qu	How nice...	1																					
17	17		302								What are you talking about?!	18																						
18	18		301									Qu laughs grimly and approaches you.																						
19	19		301								Qu	Now, your niceness is slowly destroying Qu and driving her to misfortune!	1																					
20	20		302								Qu... No! Who are you?!	21																						
21	21		301									You realize that the "Qu" standing before you is not who you thought it was, but it is too late. Qu grabs you by the throat and begins to choke you.																						
22	22		301								Qu	Lady Qu knows that as long as you exist, she will deviate more and more from the Path of Glory. So, she has sent me to kill you.	1																					
23	23		301									The form of "Qu" begins to blur, replacing itself with the Qu you first met on the Nighter.																						
24	24		302								You must be...!	25																						
25	25		201							1	500161																							
26	26		301							1	Female Construct	Only by killing you can she eliminate the confusion you bring and become the optimal vessel for completing the "Tabula Akasha".	1																					
27	27		301									The Female Construct tightens her grip on your throat.																						
28	28		302								If she... wants to kill me...	29																						
29	29		302								Then... let her do it...	30																						
30	30		301									The Female Construct bursts out laughing.																						
31	31		301								Female Construct	Hahaha! You are right, but no matter. She will understand! Now, die!	1																					
32	32		301									Just as the Female Construct is about to crush your throat, a long blade cuts off her hands.																						
33	33		301								Female Construct	AAAAGGHHH!																						
34	34		301									A stern figure appears before the Female Construct.																						
35	35		301								Female Construct	L-Lady Qu!	1																					
36	36		201							1	500150																							
37	37		301							1	Qu	I should have noticed... You were also bound by the past. Just like me.	1																					
38	38		201							1	500161																							
39	39		301							1	Female Construct	You are betraying our wish!	1																					
40	40		201							1	500150																							
41	41		301							1	Qu	No... Someone told me that maybe we should be more trusting of humanity—more trusting of my partner.	1																					
42	42		301									Qu looks down at you on the ground. Compared to the teachings of her past, she now wishes to follow her own heart.																						
43	43		301								Qu	I no longer need your teachings. I am the Kowloong Supreme. I won't follow anyone's orders any longer.	1																					
44	44		301								Qu	Now leave before I change my mind.	1																					
45	45		301									The Female Construct glares at Qu resentfully before jumping off the observation deck.																						
46	1002		401							1	207																							
47	46		301									After ensuring that the threat is gone, she hugs you tightly.																						
48	1003		204							1	14																							
49	47		301								Qu	You're still breathing, Commandant. But why did...	1																					
50	48		301								Qu	I put you in danger... Am I destined to be alone...?	1																					
51	49		301								Qu	I thought my power was unlimited as the Supreme. But now I realize just how powerless I truly am.	1																					
52	50		301									Qu strokes your face and desperately clenches her teeth to stop from crying.																						
53	51		301								Qu	I can't do anything except be by your side.	1																					
54	52		302								That's... more than enough...	53																						
55	53		301									You brush Qu's cheek to wipe away her tears. Qu is startled to see that you've finally regained consciousness.																						
56	54		302								We may have conflicting ideas... But we're still looking for a way... to understand each other.	55																						
57	55		302								Just being... by each other... makes us more than partners.	56																						
58	56		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	Indeed... Even if countless obstacles stand in our way and we never understand each other, we...	1

74	72		301									You shake your head. You have no intention of telling anyone about what happened between you and Qu.																						
75	73		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You already knew what Qu was planning on doing from that night onward.																						
76	75		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
77	76		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Qu	We might not understand each other, but...																						
78	77		301								Qu	But I believe that one day you and I will be on the same path...																						
79	78		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	When that day comes, we will become partners—not in name, but in truth.
