9	9		301							1	Hippocrates	It's too late. Give up.	1																					
10	10		302								No way...!	11																						
11	11		302								If you give up on Liv...	12																						
12	12		302								...We'll lose her forever.	13																						
13	13		301								Hippocrates	But unlike connecting with Ascendants, they are still harmonic.	1																					
14	14		301								Hippocrates	Liv is completely corrupted. If you connect with her now, your Mind Beacon will be lost as well.	1																					
15	15		302								(Telling her about Huaxu)	16																						
16	16		301								Hippocrates	Oh? Are you saying that... Huaxu hacked into Spear of F.O.S. and your Commandant link to forcibly project your Mind Beacon onto the M.I.N.D. of a Corrupted somewhere nearby?	1																					
17	17		302								Yes. That is exactly the reason.	18																						
18	18		302								Huaxu recognized my ability to connect with Ascendants.	19																						
19	19		301								Hippocrates	I see. Everyone has been talking about your ability to connect with Ascendants. I thought you came to that conclusion after giving it a test.	1																					
20	20		301								Hippocrates	How did it feel like being in the M.I.N.D. of a Corrupted?	1																					
21	21		302								It was filled with chaotic thoughts and discordant information.	22																						
22	22		301								Hippocrates	Are you confident that you can find Liv's M.I.N.D. shards in an environment like that?	1																					
23	23		302								At least let me try.	24																						
24	24		301									The two researchers look at each other, but neither says a word.																						
25	25		302								Please let me try.	26																						
26	26		301								Hippocrates	I'll level with you. This isn't like going on a battlefield. When you had people backing you up, we didn't mind letting you try.	1																					
27	27		301								Hippocrates	Now, things are different. Even if this is just a test, you can lose your mind completely should things go sideways.	1																					
28	28		301								Hippocrates	Think about it. Why have we discovered only one Commandant with the ability to connect with Ascendants after all this time? It is exactly because this test is far too dangerous.	1																					
29	29		302								Please have faith in me.

35	35		301								Asimov	I can use the Spear of F.O.S. to partially visualize the data turbulence.	2

37	37		302								Give me a chance, and I'll find her.	38																						
38	38		301								Hippocrates	Young one, are you sure you want to put someone else before yourself?	1																					
39	39		302								All I want to know is how this will affect Liv if I succeed.	40

46	46		301									You hold on to the threads of memories and follow them to search for more shards.

52	52		301									Thanks to the data turbulence visualized by Spear of F.O.S., the first shard is directly within reach. It looks like, in that memory, Liv is wandering.																						
53	53		301									This isn't a miracle or an event of good luck. Instead, it is the memories of Gray Raven connected and weaved together.																						
54	54		301									According to Asimov, this is like finding your most familiar thing in a messy image: memories of the past will guide you as a beacon of light.																						
55	55		301									Perhaps... Constructs feel the same way when they are searching for Mind Beacons to calibrate their M.I.N.D.																						
56	56		301									Having uncovered the first clue, you start searching for similar things and follow the chaotic data until a new place comes into view.

59	59		301									The next M.I.N.D. shard is on a gruesome battlefield.																						
60	60		301									Civilization is shut down, stagnant, and falling apart.																						
61	61		301									The Central Purification Filters people worked hard to build now lie in ruins. The new batch of experimental farms has been burnt to ashes.																						
62	62		301									Countless dead bodies are buried in the burning ruins. The stench of corpses utters their most painful cry in silence.																						
63	63		301									This isn't a nightmare you imagined. It is a reality that actually happened. It is part of her memories.																						
64	64		301									Liv is in this living hell, trying to save those severely injured survivors.																						
65	65		301									The girl is as fragile and vulnerable as a spiderweb hanging in hell. Even though her frame has pretty much worn out, her energy depleted, and her legs ruptured, she still carries on.																						
66	66		301									You try to catch up with her, but a dying Construct grabs you by the leg.																						
67	67		301									You know there is nothing you can do to change this memory, but you cannot bring yourself to break free from the dying Construct desperately seeking help.																						
68	68		301									This is her second M.I.N.D. shard.																						
69	69		301									After his last remaining drip of life fades away, you find yourself merging with Liv...

71	71		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory32.jpg																								
72	72		301									Following the trail of her memories, you return to an old field hospital and meet the people she knew.																						
73	73		301									Time flies by very quickly in this memory. It's like being in a time-lapse film. You see people go in and out of the hallways and sickrooms.																						
74	74		301									Sunlight shines through the window and projects a shadow on the floor as if it is a clock ticking.																						
75	75		301									Some patients don't live to see tomorrow, and some patients are lucky enough to leave this place. The only person who always stays here is her.																						
76	76		301									The girl was abandoned here by the flow of time long ago and is still trapped in this cage, bound by her duty and the guilt of not being able to save her mother.																						
77	77		301									This is her third M.I.N.D. shard.

82	82		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory391.jpg																								
83	83		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						It isn't until nightfall that you discover the dim light shimmering behind her.

107	107		301									The scars in your memories are torn apart once again. Painful memories turn into a vortex that plunge the seeker into the ocean of void.																						
108	108		301									This is exactly what happened that day...																						
109	109		301									Chaos and disorder seek through the scars and plant their rampant, savage seeds in the Mind Beacon.																						
110	110		301									Is that what it is? In the end, such failure is still inevitable.																						
111	111		301									In the end, you are still one step away from success.																						
112	112		301									...Will this be the last time you see Liv?																						
113	113		301									Where are you? How can you get away from this place? How can you break free from this prison?																						
114	114		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					The memories you have collected do not serve as answers at all. You grasp at a void to no avail.
