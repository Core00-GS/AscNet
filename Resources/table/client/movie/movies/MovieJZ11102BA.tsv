3	3		301			DialogEnable						"Hyena" rarely leaves her hiding place in the day.																						
4	4		301									Unless there was a commotion loud enough requiring her to check it out.																						
5	5		201							1	500132																							
6	6		301							1	"Hyena"	(This is too big of a commotion even for the inspection team...)	1																					
7	7		301								"Hyena"	(I should go see what it's about.)	1

9	9		301									The front of the usually empty carriage is now packed with people. Everyone is crowding around a few staff in yellow...																						
10	10		301								Worker in Yellow A	Stop pushing! You have to pass the test first! Pushing won't do you any good!																						
11	11		301								Worker in Yellow B	Yeah, you're not getting any food in your mouth if you don't know this carriage well enough!																						
12	12		301									The uproarious crowd ignores the workers and keeps pushing forward. Seeing this scene, the aristocrats' bodyguards ready to pull out their guns any time.																						
13	13		301									That is when a tall and muscular man, who was also in a worker's uniform, pushes through the bodyguards and came forward.																						
14	14		201							1	500139																							
15	15		301							1	Vigorous Male Voice	What is the meaning of this? You lot can't even do something as simple as recruiting a new guy?	1																					
16	16		202							1					1																			
17	17		301								Worker in Yellow A & B	...Leader!																						
18	18		301								Worker in Yellow A	They wouldn't listen. They keep saying they don't care if they die tomorrow as long as they get to eat...																						
19	19		201							1	500139																							
20	20		301							1	Vigorous Male Voice	Preposterous!	1																					
21	21		301								Vigorous Male Voice	What?! You don't care even if you'll die tomorrow?! Are your lives worth so little?!	1																					
22	22		202							1					1																			
23	23		301									It may have been something in the man's vigorous voice, but the crowd immediately becomes silent.																						
24	24		201							1	500139																							
25	25		301							1	Vigorous Male Voice	You wanna eat under me? Get enough provisions to fill your stomachs every day? Sure!	1																					
26	26		301								Vigorous Male Voice	If you can answer my questions, I'll make sure you get that meal of yours!	1																					
27	27		301								Vigorous Male Voice	In the name of Andre Smirnov, the chief of the inspection team, I guarantee it.	1																					
28	28		202							1					1																			
29	29		301									People chattered among themselves in the crowd, and after around ten minutes, they became quiet once more.																						
30	30		201							1	500139																							
31	31		301							1	Andre	Good, at least you lot can still comprehend human speech.	1																					
32	32		301								Andre	Now tell me, what am I holding here in my hand?	1																					
33	33		202							1					1																			
34	34		301									Andre lifts up something that resembles a wrench in his hand. It looks a little different to a normal wrench.																						
35	35		301									After a few moments, people start shouting answers like "wrench," "screwdriver," and "iron stick."																						
36	36		201							1	500139																							
37	37		301							1	Andre	Those who answered "wrench" or "ratchet wrench" can stay, the others can go home. Don't think you can fool me, I have exceptional hearing.	1																					
38	38		202							1					1																			
39	39		301									The crowd murmurs among themselves once more. Soon after, two-thirds of the people left, though it is not known if they believed what Andre said or were just merely afraid of the guns the bodyguards were holding.																						
40	40		201							1	500139																							
41	41		301							1	Andre	Next question, how many air conditioning systems and vents are in each commoner carriage?	1																					
42	42		202							1					1																			
43	43		301									Andre is met with silence, with only an occasional few numbers being mumbled out.																						
44	44		201							1	500139																							
45	45		301							1	Andre	...Come on. If you don't know, you don't know.	1																					
46	46		202							1					1																			
47	47		301									The crowd becomes quiet once more.																						
48	48		201							1	500139																							
49	49		301							1	Andre	...Sorry, but I'm afraid you lot aren't worthy of the meal I provide. I'd rather not recruit anyone if this is as good as you are. You may all leave now.	1																					
50	50		202							1					1																			
51	51		301									The crowd hesitates for a while, but dissipates in the end.																						
52	52		301								Worker in Yellow A	Chief, we're already short-staffed. We can't keep on like this...																						
53	53		201							1	500139																							
54	54		301							1	Andre	That doesn't mean we can just hire those without basic knowledge, I'm not risking it, not even for light duty.	1																					
55	55		202							1					1																			
56	56		301								Worker in Yellow A	But those aristocrats refuse to renew our equipment. They're so insatiable that we can all work ourselves to a pulp and still fail to satisfy them.																						
57	57		201							1	500139																							
58	58		301							1	Andre	There are still other carriages, right? Hopefully, we'll find someone who qualifies.	1																					
59	59		202							1					1																			
60	60		301									That is when Andre notices the skinny little girl standing in front of him.																						
61	61		201							1	500139																							
62	62		301							1	Andre	What's the matter? Inspection work is not for kids.	1																					
63	63		201							1	500132																							
64	64		301							1	"Hyena"	Each commoner carriage has four sets of air conditioning systems, and each system has 16 vents, equaling to a total of 64.	1																					
65	65		301								"Hyena"	What you're holding is a 32-tooth NT64 ratchet wrench manufactured by Cosmos Industries.	1																					
66	66		202							1					1																			
67	67		301									Andre is surprised by the girl's answer.																						
68	68		201							1	500139		-400																					
69	69		201							2	500132		400																					
70	70		301							1	Andre	Looks like you know your stuff, shame that you're just a kid.	1																					
71	71		301								Andre	How did you know that?	1																					
72	72		301								"Hyena"	I've been through each of the 64 vents.	2																					
73	73		301								Andre	That's quite a claim you're making, even I can't say for sure I've been through every vent.	1																					
74	74		301								"Hyena"	...You don't trust me.	2																					
75	75		301								Andre	And why should I? Everyone can lie.	1																					
76	76		301								Andre	But if you can, I don't mind feeding you even if you're a kid.	1																					
77	77		301								"Hyena"	...	2																					
78	78		301								"Hyena"	...Check the 4th air conditioning system.	2																					
79	79		301								Andre	Why?	1																					
80	80		301								"Hyena"	The air duct's broken. You guys have been trying to fix the gas backflow problem around here recently.	2																					
81	81		301								Andre	Stop lying, we just changed the air duct of the 4th air conditioning system not long ago.	1																					
82	82		301								"Hyena"	The air duct is undoubtedly new, and the problem did improve temporarily. But if you don't get rid of the rats in the filter box, then the problem will still persist when their excrement accumulate.	2																					
83	83		202							2					1																			
84	84		203							1	0.25	0																						
85	85		301								Andre	...Caglia, go check it out.	1																					
86	86		202							1	2				1																			
87	87		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Worker in Yellow A	Sure, Chief.																						
88	88		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						...																						
89	89		301								Worker in Yellow A	****, this is disgusting...																						
90	90		201							1	500139																							
91	91		301							1	Andre	So?	1																					
92	92		202							1					1																			
93	93		301								Worker in Yellow A	Well, what she said is true, we had to dismantle the whole case to get rid of them.																						
94	94		301								Worker in Yellow A	It'd take at least a week for us to find the problem, how in the world did she know?																						
95	95		301									Andre glances at the rags "Hyena" wears as clothes. He sees that the shoulder and back parts are covered in dust and tears.																						
96	96		201							1	500139																							
97	97		301							1	Andre	You've been in the vents. Why?	1																					
98	98		201							1	500132																							
99	99		301							1	"Hyena"	So that my food won't be taken away, I'm used to it.	1																					
100	100		201							1	500139																							
101	101		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Andre	...Come with me.	1
