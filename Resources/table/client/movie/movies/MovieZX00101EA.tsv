54	54		301							1	Liv	You've already been corrupted by the Punishing Virus, but fortunately, it still hasn't exceeded the tolerance limit of your Inver-Device.	1																					
55	55		301								Liv	Please allow me to access your M.I.N.D., I can help lessen your burden from fighting with the virus.	1																					
56	56		301								Construct Soldier	Thank you... I never thought I'd live to see such an advanced Support-type Construct...	2																					
57	57		301								Construct Soldier	If only they were able to hold on a bit longer...	2

62	62		301							1	Construct Soldier	Sorry, but we haven't encountered the Construct you asked about...	2																					
63	63		301								Construct Soldier	We're a supply team that got forced to retreat onto this bridge by the Corrupted and made this temporary communication station as a last resort.	2																					
64	64		301								Construct Soldier	The amount of Corrupted and threat levels here exceeded our calculations... They broke through our guard rather quickly...	2																					
65	65		301								Construct Soldier	We've never seen anything like that before... I can say for sure that the Corrupted have formed an organization...	2

72	72		301							1	Construct Soldier	Did you notice those graffiti nearby?	2																					
73	73		301								Construct Soldier	We found that these graffiti will draw in the mechanoid Corrupted, and only they can understand its true meaning.	2																					
74	74		301								Construct Soldier	We tried to decipher the messages, but mechanoids with human consciousness like us can't understand it at all...	2																					
75	75		301								Construct Soldier	Be careful of those graffiti... They are gathering the Corrupted...	2

79	79		301							1	Liv	Is this a new behavior of the Corrupted due to the control of the Punishing Virus?	1																					
80	80		301								Lee	I'm afraid not, the Corrupted's only goal is to destroy humans and everything that has human consciousness.	3																					
81	81		301								Lee	But they don't need to communicate with each other, or maybe this is a result of something else other than the Punishing Virus.	3
