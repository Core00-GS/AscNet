4	4		301									The sun has to hide to reveal the countless, brighter stars glistening in the expanse of the universe.																						
5	5		301									Emerald light waves in the air like a dress weaved by the goddesses, dancing underneath the endless stars.																						
6	6		301									As you look up, the light particles that have wandered the universe for millions of years finally find the end of their journey, settling inside your pupils.																						
7	7		301									Between then and now is a distance that no one can ever travel in a lifetime.																						
8	8		301									And yet, a connection is made by the simple action of looking up.

17	17		301			DialogEnable				1	Bianca	I'm sorry for asking you to accompany me at this hour, Commandant.	1																					
18	18		301									A gentle, apologetic voice arrives from your side, drawing your gaze back from the stars.																						
19	19		301									Bianca stands by you on a broad snowfield. The heating device illuminates her face with a warm light, highlighting her eyes and the reflections of the starry sky in them.																						
20	20		302								It's like racing the sun.	21																						
21	21		301									Unlike the rest of the planet, the polar regions experience the midnight sun and polar night in different seasons because of their angles from the sun, when days and nights would last more than a day.																						
22	22		301									The research station Bianca and you have been assigned to happens to be situated at the edge of the Antarctic Circle, which is one of the few places in Antarctica where there is still a night sky in winter.																						
23	23		301									Although the night sky technically lasts five to six hours, the stars can only be observed in less than half of that time.																						
24	24		301								Bianca	It seems that we haven't been able to have a night out the past few days, doesn't it?	1																					
25	25		302								We were busy with our daytime missions, after all.	26																						
26	26		202							1																								
27	27		301									You have been staying in Antarctica for the past two weeks. The transport craft is arriving any day now.																						
28	28		301									The restoration of Lanternlighter is also reaching the end. Another two weeks, and it will be back in sailing shape.																						
29	29		301									With that, the load on the Expedition Team has lightened. Their captain decides that Bianca and you can have some free time before you go.																						
30	30		301									And as the sky began to turn dark earlier tonight, Bianca came to you with a proposal.																						
31	31		301									You have driven to this empty highland in the middle of the night, away from the midnight sun, where you can go stargazing.

33	33		301							1	Bianca	We're going back to Babylonia in three days, and the Expedition Captain hasn't assigned us any task.	1																					
34	34		301								Bianca	I know we're only temporary members, but I still want to help them until the last possible second.	1																					
35	35		302								It's a shame we won't be here for their next voyage.	36	I wish we could see the Lanternlighter fully restored.	900																				
36	36		204							1	3																							
37	37	39	301								Bianca	This isn't somewhere you can leave without regrets after staying a dozen days, after all.	1																					
38	900		204							1	3																							
39	38		301								Bianca	Me too... A small regret, I must say.	1																					
40	39		204							1	4																							
41	40		301								Bianca	Still, I think we... no—I've been very lucky already.	1																					
42	41		204							1	1																							
43	42		301								Bianca	These two weeks have been the longest I've greeted people as someone other than the "Purifying Force Captain" ever since I enlisted.	1																					
44	43		301								Bianca	It is as if I were a diver finally surfacing, taking off my mask and breathing fresh air for the first time in a long time.	1																					
45	44		301								Bianca	Who knows what kind of trouble it would have caused me if it were my team who saw me slacking like this?	1																					
46	45		301								Bianca	Which is why I'm glad it's been you by my side, Commandant.	1																					
47	46		302								You always give it your all, whether or not it is an assignment from the Purifying Force.	47																						
48	47		301									Not to mention that it is quite a stretch for you to call what she has done the last few weeks "slacking."																						
49	48		204							1	3																							
50	49		301								Bianca	I'm not displeased with my role—or I should say I'm glad I've joined the Purifying Force.	1																					
51	50		204							1	4																							
52	51		301								Bianca	Some perspectives are only available to people in the Purifying Force.	1																					
53	52		301								Bianca	Some objectives can only be achieved by the Purifying Force as well.	1																					
54	53		301								Bianca	Fish in the deep sea sometimes chase after the sunlight beyond the water out of curiosity.	1																					
55	54		204							1	1																							
56	55		301								Bianca	But that is just a momentary fantasy. In the end, fish belongs to the sea... My apologies. This might not be the best analogy.	1																					
57	56		301								Bianca	Anyway... this place is but a dream to me.	1																					
58	57		301								Bianca	I'll still be the Bianca from the Purifying Force after we return to Babylonia.	1																					
59	58		301								Bianca	And you'll go on as the "Gray Raven Commandant", won't you?	1																					
60	59		302								...	60																						
61	60		301								Bianca	But before that happens...	1																					
62	61		204							1	4																							
63	62		301								Bianca	Let's give this dream a fitting end.	1																					
64	63		301									With that, Bianca gently closes her eyes.																						
65	64		302								A fitting end?	65																						
66	65		301								Bianca	Shh...	1																					
67	66		301									She answers your question with a hush sign, placing a finger on her lips.																						
68	67		301								Bianca	It's about time...	1																					
69	68		301								Bianca	Just a little longer.	1																					
70	69		301									As if drawn by the magic in her words, a line of pearl-white light tears the night sky apart in the horizon.																						
71	70		301									It is the end of the night and the prelude of dawn.																						
72	71		301									The twinkling stars are slowly wiped away by the dawning sun, and the dark curtains that have shrouded the sky lift to reveal the stage.																						
73	72		301									But right before night changes into day—

86	85		302								What's this...?	86																						
87	86		301								Bianca	The Expedition team told me that this could happen before sunrise, given today's temperature and humidity.	1																					
88	87		301								Bianca	Water vapor in low altitudes freezes directly into tiny ice crystals in the air, refracting the sun like diamonds... I should stop explaining before I completely ruin the mood.	1																					
89	88		301								Bianca	"Diamond dust"... It only happens for a few minutes as night becomes dawn.	1																					
90	89		301								Bianca	Does this feel like a fitting end to our journey in Antarctica, Commandant?	1																					
91	90		301									Bianca's golden-colored pupils turn to you once again through the lustrous halo formed by the water vapor.	1																					
92	91		302								Is this why you...?	92																						
93	92		204							1	3																							
94	93		301								Bianca	I probably wouldn't do something like this normally.	1																					
95	94		204							1	4																							
96	95		301								Bianca	But please indulge me just for a little bit today.	1																					
97	96		204							1	1																							
98	97		301								Bianca	There never was, and never will be, another sacred place like this that just belongs to you and me.	1																					
99	98		301								Bianca	Another step from here, and we'll be back on our own paths. Who knows? We might even end up on opposite sides one day.	1																					
100	99		301								Bianca	Just like the penguin we saw that day... we both have our own "iceberg" we wish to climb.	1																					
101	100		301								Bianca	That isn't something we can give up, no matter the cost.	1																					
102	101		204							1	3																							
103	102		301								Bianca	Still...	1																					
104	103		301								Bianca	I can't help but want to keep a little place for you in my heart.	1																					
105	104		204							1	1																							
106	105		301								Bianca	There will not be another memory like this, a shared path we started and ended—I've made that decision on my own.	1																					
107	106		204							1	4																							
108	107		301								Bianca	This will be how I remember the light that accidentally enters the dark.	1																					
109	108		204							1	2																							
110	109		301								Bianca	I won't apologize for it, even if this has caused you distress.	1																					
111	110		301									Bianca sounds stubborn. Unyielding.																						
112	111		302								...Hold on.	112																						
113	112		302								It's no distress per se...	113																						
114	113		302								But there's still something I'd like to correct.	114																						
115	114		204							1	7																							
116	115		301								Bianca	To correct..?	1																					
117	116		301									You take out the camera you've been carrying for the past weeks.																						
118	117		301									You power it up and turn the knob.																						
119	118		301									You've been taking hundreds of photos with it in the last dozen days.																						
120	119		301									Most of them were taken when Bianca was with you, but some you took yourself when you went out alone.																						
121	120		301									Within one of these photos is something you've been hoping to share with Bianca—an answer you discovered during your Antarctic journey.																						
122	121		302								(Pass her your camera)	122																						
123	122		301								Bianca	What's this...?	1																					
124	123		301									She takes the camera and looks at the photo on its tiny screen, and she is taken aback, just as you expected.																						
125	124		301									It's a photo of emperor penguins.																						
126	125		301									More accurately, it is a photo of a flock of emperor penguins slowly approaching a lone penguin on an icefield before uniting into one group.																						
127	126		301									The outlier and the crowd might have taken different paths, but it is the same "iceberg" they wanted to climb over.																						
128	127		301									This journey, therefore, does not consist of two parallel paths that will never cross.																						
129	128		302								You're right, Bianca.	129																						
130	129		302								Our paths are indeed different.	130																						
131	130		301									To say that a commandant of the Task Force can understand a captain from the Purifying Force is an utterly pointless lie.																						
132	131		301									But still.																						
133	132		301									Even though the battlefields you are on cannot be farther away...																						
134	133		301									Even though you have to pretend to be strangers for now and treat each other with aloofness...																						
135	134		301									Even though your gazes will meet one day over what neither of you can back down from...																						
136	135		301									Even though there will be a time when your blades will be drawn to defend your beliefs...																						
137	136		302								But...	137																						
138	137		301									You still believe—																						
139	138		301									In that future you are fighting for—that world you will spend your life upholding—																						
140	139		302								They will meet again... no—	140																						
141	140		301									She will be waiting for you under the clear sky you have reclaimed.																						
142	141		302								They will meet again somewhere we can see—	142																						
143	142		302								Times and times again.	143																						
144	143		204							1	8																							
145	144		301								Bianca	...	1																					
146	145		301									Bianca falls silent after hearing what you said.																						
147	146		204							1	3																							
148	147		301								Bianca	As always, your words will not let me off easily.	1																					
149	148		204							1	1																							
150	149		301								Bianca	Our paths will certainly cross in the future.	1																					
151	150		301								Bianca	You don't seem to think of it just as a wonderful fantasy.	1																					
152	151		204							1	4																							
153	152		301								Bianca	How many people yearn for courage like this?	1																					
154	153		204							1	1																							
155	154		302								No matter what you think...	155																						
156	155		302								I don't agree this is where our path "ended."	156	I only agree that this is where our path "started."	156																				
157	156		204							1	3																							
158	157		301								Bianca	...What do I ever do with you.	1																					
159	158		301									She sighs, submitting to your surprising stubbornness.																						
160	159		204							1	4																							
161	160		301								Bianca	By the way, Commandant—	1																					
162	161		204							1	1																							
163	162		301								Bianca	Do you remember me saying that I had a more personal reason to ask you to join me on this mission back on the transport craft?	1																					
164	163		204							1	3																							
165	164		301								Bianca	I probably would have made up some excuses if you pressed on back then.	1																					
166	165		204							1	8																							
167	166		301								Bianca	The truth is, even I didn't understand where that conflict inside me stemmed from.	1																					
168	167		301								Bianca	Even now... I cannot say I'm absolutely certain about what that reason is.	1																					
169	168		204							1	1																							
170	169		301								Bianca	But I'm not afraid to say it now.	1																					
171	170		301									She takes a deep breath and puts her hands on her chest.																						
172	171		301								Bianca	The truth is...	1																					
173	172		204							1	3																							
174	173		301								Bianca	There isn't one.	1																					
175	174		302								There isn't one?	175																						
176	175		204							1	4																							
177	176		301								Bianca	By the time I realized it, I already handed in the application to the command center.	1																					
178	177		301								Bianca	I took a long time trying to justify it.	1																					
179	178		301								Bianca	My "excuse" might have convinced everyone else, but it couldn't convince me.	1																					
180	179		204							1	8																							
181	180		301								Bianca	How peculiar... I've given up so many things so many times, but I could not give up on this.	1																					
182	181		204							1	1																							
183	182		301								Bianca	But now, it doesn't really matter anymore.	1																					
184	183		301								Bianca	That "reason" doesn't need to be something I must discover, right?	1																					
185	184		204							1	8																							
186	185		301								Bianca	...	1																					
187	186		204							1	5																							
188	187		301								Bianca	I'm sorry, Commandant.	1																					
189	188		301								Bianca	I was still trying to hide from you, even now... trying to hide from myself.	1																					
190	189		204							1	8																							
191	190		301								Bianca	I can't find a reason to be something I'm not, and I don't want to search for it anymore.	1																					
192	191		301								Bianca	If I have to explain this whim...	1																					
193	192		204							1	1																							
194	193		301								Bianca	There's only one thing I can say.	1																					
195	194		301								Bianca	Just like what that famous explorer said to the summit he wanted to conquer—	1																					
196	195		301								Bianca	It's because...	1																					
197	196		301								Bianca	You're here.	1																					
198	197		301									With that, she sighs, breathing out white steam as her body visibly relaxes.																						
199	198		204							1	4																							
200	199		301								Bianca	Ha... I've kept these thoughts hidden for so long, it's so freeing to have said them out loud.	1																					
201	200		301									She clears her throat before regaining her composure.																						
202	201		204							1	8																							
203	202		301								Bianca	I'm sure there are things you want to say, Commandant.	1																					
204	203		204							1	3																							
205	204		301								Bianca	But I hope you would do me the courtesy of remaining silent as you digest what I just said.	1																					
206	205		302								(Remain silent)	206	(Give a dry chuckle)	206																				
207	206		204							1	2																							
208	207		301								Bianca	Right...	1																					
209	208		301								Bianca	"Diamond dust"... is almost over.	1																					
210	209		301								Bianca	Don't you want to take a photo on this rare occasion?	1																					
211	210		301									The moment when night and day meet is coming to an end, and the sun is about to rise.																						
212	211		302								Well...	212																						
213	212		302								I don't think so.	213	Sure.	224																				
214	213		204							1	7																							
215	214		301								Bianca	Why?	1																					
216	215		302								This is a "memory," isn't it?	216																						
217	216		301									Memories are not something you record with film or data.																						
218	217		301									Whether it is the sparkling diamond dust or Bianca's smile...																						
219	218		301									Heartfelt conversations, or surprising confessions...																						
220	219		301									You tap where your heart is.																						
221	220		302								I'll carefully guard it here.	221																						
222	221		302								And I'll prepare the little space for our future "memories."	223																						
223	222		204							1	4																							
224	223	239	301								Bianca	Is that so...	1																					
225	224		301									You take a photo of the fleeting scene.																						
226	225		301									As you press the shutter, you begin to understand what Bianca said.																						
227	226		301									Not everything needs to be "commemorated."																						
228	227		301									The important moments, the unforgettable things...																						
229	228		301									Before you record them with some external devices...																						
230	229		301									You have already placed them safely in your heart.																						
231	230		302								Just like that... Done.	231																						
232	231		302								Speaking of those "future memories"...	232																						
233	232		301									You will not keep this camera forever.																						
234	233		301									Not to mention that memories are not something photos can fully capture.																						
235	234		302								How about I keep them here instead?																							
236	235		301									You tap where your heart is.																						
237	236		302								It's a deal.	237
