5	5		301								Ayla	...No one's here, it seems. I can probably just... put this here...	1

7	7		301									Ayla moves lightly, placing the fortune bag with the couplets on the table.																						
8	8		301									Looking around, she can hardly find a flattering spot in the Strike Hawk's lounge.																						
9	9		201							1	500110																							
10	10		301							1	Ayla	It's not a good habit to judge others' aesthetics, but, still... sigh.	1																					
11	11		301								???	Sorry, Ayla, if this is too embarrassing. I simply prefer my lounge to be as simple as possible.																						
12	12		301									Ayla is not surprised to hear Chrome's voice behind her.																						
13	13		301								Ayla	You're a captain. Defend yourself, at the very least.	1

16	16		301							1	Chrome	I was the one who ordered the decorations to be taken down—Wanshi, the sleepyhead, kept hitting them when he woke up. It wasn't a big deal for Constructs, sure...	2																					
17	17		301								Ayla	But as a captain, you're still worried... I see.	1																					
18	18		204							2																								
19	19		301								Chrome	You're mistaken. Wanshi would use that as an excuse to avoid practice, so I spent some effort replacing all the decorations, and I put all these paddings on the edges and corners of the tables and chairs.	2																					
20	20		301								Ayla	I... see... Oh, right. I almost forgot.	1																					
21	21		301									Ayla remembers why she is here and hands Chrome the bag she placed on the table.																						
22	22		204							1	1																							
23	23		301								Ayla	I'm actually here on behalf of WGAA to give you this.	1																					
24	24		204							2	1																							
25	25		301								Chrome	Is that so? Do I need to give you a receipt, or something? Allow me.	2																					
26	26		301								Ayla	Eh, no? You misunderstood. Inside the bags is a pair of couplets from WGAA. They're like decorations for the festival, like... Christmas tree.	1																					
27	27		301									Chrome opens the bag and peeks inside, and he finds two pieces of red paper with words on them.																						
28	28		204							1																								
29	29		301								Chrome	Couplets, you say? It's Lunar New Year, isn't it? My thanks to WGAA for preparing this.	2																					
30	30		301								Ayla	Oh? How come you know what they are, Chrome?	1																					
31	31		301								Chrome	I read about the festival in a book before. I was quite interested in this form of art, so I still remember bits of it.	2																					
32	32		301								Ayla	Whoa, I'm so moved! If we can create another person like you, WGAA's effort will not be in vain!	1																					
33	33		301								Chrome	That's... a bit hyperbolic, isn't it...	2																					
34	34		202							1	2				1																			
35	35		301									As the two of them talk, a tall Construct walks in, looking frustrated.

37	37		301							1	Kamui	Capt... Why did you leave me behind... I got caught by old man Nik... I mean, Commander Nikola, and he gave me one hell of a talk...	1																					
38	38		201							1	500155	1																						
39	39		301							1	Chrome	You're right on time. Help me put these couplets up, won't you?	1																					
40	40		301									Seeing the red sheets in Chrome's hand, Kamui walks closer curiously.

42	42		201							2	1081001	1	450																					
43	43		301								Kamui	What?! What are "couplets"?	2																					
44	44		301									Chrome gestures to the running Kamui to lower his voice.																						
45	45		301								Chrome	Kamui, Wanshi's probably sleeping, so don't wake him up.	1

49	49		301							1	Ayla	What?! You mean there's someone else here? But... I was knocking, and nobody answered!	3																					
50	50		301								Kamui	Oh, hi, Ayla! We've met, I think—long time no see!	2																					
51	51		301								Chrome	...Looks like we can skip the introduction. And you're right—our third member is here, indeed. But it's that time of the day.	1																					
52	52		301								Ayla	That time of the day?	3																					
53	53		301								Chrome	...For him to sleep.	1																					
54	54		301								Ayla	A Construct in sleep mode, is it? No wonder no one answered.	3																					
55	55		301								Kamui	Wanshi does that a lot, so don't mind it. By the way, can I open this? Does it come with gifts like the red envelopes?	2																					
56	56		301									Kamui grabs the fortune bag from Chrome as he speaks and looks inside with anticipation.																						
57	57		301								Ayla	Of course! It's for you!	3																					
58	58		301									With a bit of rustling, Kamui opens the bag and looks at the beautifully written couplets in his hands, his head tilted in confusion.																						
59	59		204							2																								
60	60		301								Kamui	It's just... pretty red paper, Capt.?	2																					
61	61		301								Kamui	And there are only two pieces, but... there are three of us!	2																					
62	62		301								Chrome	This isn't a gift for us personally. They're decors for the room.	1																					
63	63		301								Ayla	It's a tradition from the ancient East. Although we're still not sure what their application is, the words written on them are all beautiful blessings.	3																					
64	64		301								Ayla	In the past, the people in the East would put these couplets up outside the door during Springtime as a way to wish for good luck in the coming year!	3																					
65	65		204							2	1																							
66	66		301								Kamui	Ah, I see! If this will make our dreams come true... Capt., Ayla, can I decide where to place it?	2																					
67	67		301								Chrome	I don't need it in my room, so... it's fine by me.	1																					
68	68		301								Kamui	How about you, Ayla? Please let me handle this!	2																					
69	69		301								Ayla	I'm supposed to give it to you to handle it, so of course—you have your captain's permission. You can do it.	3																					
70	70		301								Kamui	Capt., Ayla, I will make sure to put the couplets and their intentions to good use!	2
