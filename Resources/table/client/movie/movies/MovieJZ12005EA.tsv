8	8		301								John	I've lost.	2																					
9	9		301								John	If you had sacrificed your pawns, this would have ended even quicker.	2																					
10	10		301								John	You're a Construct. I think you could have calculated how best to make your moves.	2																					
11	11		301								Chrome	But that wouldn't be my judgment.	1																					
12	12		301								Chrome	To machines, this is simply deduction and calculation based on objective facts, with no emotions and moral considerations involved.	1																					
13	13		301								Chrome	But I am no machine.	1																					
14	14		301								Chrome	I make my own assessment of the situation, and I make my own choices based on my judgment.	1																					
15	15		301								John	Do you think I'll agree with you just because you've won a game of chess?	2																					
16	16		301								Chrome	I believe... there is no meaningless victory.	1																					
17	17		301									His father has never told him what happens after becoming a Smith.																						
18	18		301									Or, perhaps, his father has told him about the end of a Smith's journey from the very beginning.																						
19	19		301									Become a Smith, then find the next Smith to inherit everything. An endless cycle.																						
20	20		301								Chrome	But I'm not trying to become a Smith.	1																					
21	21		301								Chrome	I'm going to surpass it.	1																					
22	22		301								Chrome	I'll use "Smith" to become "Chrome".	1																					
23	23		301									Not abandoning his past. Not denying it, either.																						
24	24		301									Langston Smith, Chief of class, Construct, Strike Hawk Captainâ€”																						
25	25		301									They are all necessary for him to become "Chrome".

27	27		301								Chrome	The war will be over one day.	1																					
28	28		301								Chrome	When that happens, Constructs and humans will share the world we reclaim together.	1																					
29	29		301								Chrome	I asked you what a "perfect being" was when you first told me a Smith's duty.	1																					
30	30		301								Chrome	I still can't give you a concrete answer right now, but I will build the bridge that leads us there.	1																					
31	31		301								Chrome	Therefore... this is what I choose in the end.	1																					
32	32		301								Chrome	I've never considered undoing my identity as a Construct. Not now, not ever.	1

34	34		301								John	You will face unimaginable difficulties and hurdles.	2																					
35	35		301								John	The path you are taking will take you to an endless pit. It will devour you until there is nothing left.	2																					
36	36		301								John	Your fight will not stop even when you leave the battlefield. Do you understand what it means?	2																					
37	37		301								Chrome	You taught me that a Smith does not fear hardship. We excel in them.	1																					
38	38		301								Chrome	And Chrome from Strike Hawk does not enter a fight without proper preparations.	1																					
39	39		301								Chrome	I'm your son, Dad.	1																					
40	40		301								John	...	2																					
41	41		301								John	The specialized frame Asimov is working on has only worked on a Construct on Gray Raven so far.	2																					
42	42		301								John	To adapt to that frame, that Construct paid a hefty price.	2																					
43	43		301								John	If you can adapt to this specialized frame with no complications, I'll approve of your choice. I'll stop interfering with your decisions after that as well.	2																					
44	44		301								John	But if you can't even take on a new frame, then every word you just said is hollow.	2																					
45	45		301								Chrome	I understand. I do not plan to fail.	1																					
46	46		301								Chrome	I will use this frame to demonstrate my determination and what I can achieve.	1																					
47	47		301								John	...																						
48	48		301									After a while, John moves his eyes from Chrome's resolute expression back to the paused game on the chessboard.																						
49	49		301									Like how Chrome picked up the projection of a piece before, John picks up the Queen on A8 and moves it to H8.																						
50	50		301									Completely out of the way of the Black Bishop.																						
51	51		301									With no more threats, the Black side will easily take the game.																						
52	52		301									There is an extra hint of surprise in the way Chrome looks at John. He shifts his eyes back to the board, concealing his feelings.																						
53	53		301									He lifts his hand and moves the chess piece. Black Bishop moves to H8.																						
54	54		301									Checkmate.																						
55	55		202							1	2				1																			
56	56		301									Chrome stands up from his chair and bows to the man sitting opposite him.

60	60		301							1		John stares at the ended game for a long time, lost in thought.
