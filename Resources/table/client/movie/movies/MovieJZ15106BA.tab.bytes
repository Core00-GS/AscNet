7	7		301								Guard A	The connection was cut before we could activate them. They've already occupied the area. We can't get inside to fix the machines!	1																					
8	8		301								Guard A	The basement exit has been totally destroyed. Some of our own are trapped in there!	1

12	12		301								Guard B	You're... from the Special Security Department...	2																					
13	13		301								Mao Zhen	I'll be in charge of this situation from now on. The security cameras are working, right?	1																					
14	14		301								Guard B	Yeah. The Corrupted haven't noticed the cameras yet. They're gathered in sections A and B right now and will probably make their way up here soon.	2																					
15	15		301									With an impassive face, Mao Zhen gives orders to the panicking Kurono soldiers who lost their head when the "Corrupted" charged in.																						
16	16		301									After calming the guards down, he trains his gaze onto the screen, which shows a horde of armed "Corrupted". Their leader Camu's greatsword is especially eye-catching.																						
17	17		301								Mao Zhen	With the current situation, we can't expect the headquarters to send any ground troops. The few of you should stay here and report to me. The rest of you, come with me. We'll take down the Corrupted.	1

25	25		301								Camu	Of course they wouldn't. Remember, don't let any of them slip by. Show them what it really means to not leave behind a single speck of dust!	1

27	27		301									Spurred on by hatred, Camu's squad goes on a destructive rampage like unchained monsters, smashing all the guard bots and supplies in the way.																						
28	28		301									The computers storing important data, too, and life-saving equipment. They crush them all without a second thought.
