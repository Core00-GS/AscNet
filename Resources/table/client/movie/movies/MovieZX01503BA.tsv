3	3		301									Another bright day begins to break. Laoyu gets up and washes up as normal, then moves the dried wood from the shelf to the warehouse.																						
4	4		301									Laoyu is unsure why he continues to do this, other than the fact that not doing so would make his day feel incomplete.																						
5	5		301								Laoyu	H-heave—ho!																						
6	6		301									As he puts a piece of wood on his shoulder and raises his head, a confused Changyu appears before him.																						
7	7		301								Laoyu	W-w-what are you doing?! Y-y-you scared me!

9	9		301							1	Changyu	Oh, sorry... Need a hand?	1																					
10	10		301								Laoyu	Careful. P-put it off to the side.

12	12		301								Changyu	Hey, Laoyu. Can I ask you something?	1																					
13	13		301								Laoyu	W-what?																						
14	14		301									Laoyu immediately tenses up. After all, Changyu has always been the one to come up with all sorts of funny ideas.																						
15	15		301								Changyu	It's just... I know you also take care of the equipment. So usually, what do we need to put on a performance?	1																					
16	16		301								Laoyu	You s-still want to put on a p-performance?																						
17	17		301								Changyu	Heh, don't worry about it. Let's just say I wanted to put on a show.	1																					
18	18		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Laoyu	O-okay...																						
19	19		202							1					1																			
20	20		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Laoyu	Two stereos, two platforms, t-three lights, instruments...																						
21	21		301									Changyu jots down in his notebook.																						
22	22		301								Laoyu	Ch-Changyu.																						
23	23		201							1	500230																							
24	24		301							1	Changyu	What?	1																					
25	25		301								Laoyu	D-do you really want to put on your own p-p-performance?																						
26	26		301								Changyu	Hah, sure, let's go with that. By the way, is Yusheng back?	1																					
27	27		301								Laoyu	N-no, he hasn't been seen all m-morning. Director said if h-he's not back this a-a-afternoon, I should s-send someone to ask for him.																						
28	28		301								Changyu	Maybe something happened to him. I was going to sleep on the roof of Yanfei hall yesterday, but the streets were in chaos all night. I couldn't sleep at all.	1																					
29	29		301								Changyu	What could it be? The Kowloong Crew was running up and down the streets yesterday.	1																					
30	30		301								Laoyu	M-might be that c-celebration on the radio last n-n-night...																						
31	31		301								Changyu	?	1																					
32	32		301									Laoyu takes a radio out of his pocket and adjusts the frequency. A wobbling voice, warped by static, fades in and out through the old speaker.																						
33	33		301								News Report	As everyone waited at the edge of their seats, the World Government's first Zero-point Reactor has successfully completed its first test.																						
34	34		301								News Report	The Kowloong Chamber of Commerce has decided to use this opportunity to host a city-wide celebration. At this...																						
35	35		301								Laoyu	T-the reporter says that t-they're going to invite the heads of c-c-commercial organizations to host a b-banquet...																						
36	36		204							1	1																							
37	37		301									Laoyu says to himself, unaware that as the broadcast plays, Changyu begins to light up.																						
38	38		301								Changyu	...Oh! Eureka!	1																					
39	39		301								Changyu	I'll be right back!	1																					
40	40		202							1					1																			
41	41		301									Changyu grabs the pocket radio from Laoyu and runs into the inner courtyard.

48	48		301								Changyu	Director! This is our last chance! If we can get this gig, the theater will last at least another six months!	1																					
49	49		301								Director	Changyu.	2																					
50	50		301								Director	A third of the world's biggest tycoons will all be at this banquet. Do you think this is something we can handle?	2																					
51	51		204							1	21																							
52	52		301								Changyu	Who cares! Our livelihoods are at stake!	1																					
53	53		301								Director	Fine. Let's give it a chance.	2																					
54	54		301								Director	The issue, though, is that we don't even have the money to pay for a band or a supporting cast...	2																					
55	55		301								Changyu	I'll go raise it! If it's just one show...	1																					
56	56		202							1			1																					
57	57		301									With that, Changyu tosses the radio on the director's table and rushes out again.

60	60		301								Director	That child... Sigh, I guess that's what makes him Changyu.	2																					
61	61		301								Director	Even these ol' bones sometimes feel like there's nothing this kid can't do...	2																					
62	62		301								Director	Even if the theater is really gone, I'm sure he'll manage just fine...	2																					
63	63		301									The director drinks the last mouthful of strong tea and dials up his "old friend."																						
64	64		204							2																								
65	65		301								Director	It's me. I may be old and washed up, but I have a small favor to ask...	2																					
66	66		202							2					1																			
67	67		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Running into the street, the glory days of the theater seem to flash right before Changyu's very eyes—

71	71		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The walls and eaves were not as dilapidated, but instead, covered in the highest quality of white plaster. The extravagance was classical—intricate friezes, vermillion pillars, and tiles of ceramic blue.																						
72	72		301									And yet, what truly made it a spectacle was the long line of people at the gate of the theater, alive with the greeting of the attendants and urging voices from the crowd one after another.																						
73	73		301								Bystander A	Hey! Can you fit one more in tonight's Black Guardian?																						
74	74		301								Servant	Apologies, sir! At this rate you'll have to sit on the table!																						
75	75		301								Bystander B	A pot of jasmine tea and another plate of stewed beef tendon and boiled noodles, please!																						
76	76		301								Bystander C	Hah! People who didn't know this is a theater would be thinking this is some restaurant. Didn't have dinner before you came here or what?																						
77	77		301								Bystander B	What's it got to do with you! Nothing beats dinner and a show!																						
78	78		301									The crowd pushed Changyu into the theater. In the front row, Laoyu and the director were sitting there and waving to him. Changyu waved back to them excitedly.																						
79	79		301								Changyu	Quite the turn out tonight!																						
80	80		301								Laoyu	Yu-Yusheng's new play, sure to be a h-hit.																						
81	81		301								Director	Sit down and quit fidgeting.																						
82	82		301								Changyu	Hehe, yea—yeah!																						
83	83		301									The theater lights dimmed, leaving the spotlight on the stage as the only source of light. There stood Yusheng, Mr. Bai, and Liuzhi. They stood there valiantly as if untouched by sorrows in the past.																						
84	84		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Following that, the gongs and drums roared as the show began—

91	91		301								Changyu	Repairing the equipment, creating the props, then calling Liuzhi and Mr. Bai back for another night of shows...	1																					
92	92		301								Changyu	As for the play... Yusheng loves acting as the scholar so much, let's just do Mandarin Duck Pond. Liuzhi and Su Bai can be the supporting actors. Life imitates theater, theater imitates life—wonderful!	1																					
93	93		301								Changyu	As for the cost... Four thousand... No, four thousand five hundred. If I can get Liuzhi and Su Bai to deceive each other, that should about cover it.	1																					
94	94		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The young man secretly settles the cost. And in the theater, so does the old man.

100	100		301								Director	But I'm sure he'll direct a good play.	2																					
101	101		301								Director	I don't have much time left. He's not my direct disciple, but he's a good learner.	2																					
102	102		301								Director	If you really plan on using the celebration to save the theater, I think it'll be a good choice to keep him after that.	2																					
103	103		301								Director	As for us and the others? We're too old and washed up. This is no longer our generation.	2
