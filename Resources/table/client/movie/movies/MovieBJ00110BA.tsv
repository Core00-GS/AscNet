23	23		301							1	Forsaken	You were the one who put an end to our seventeen-year civil war, after all!	3																					
24	24		301							1	Watanabe	Just doing my job, son.	2																					
25	25		301							1	Watanabe	We are all descendants of the soldiers in the old days. The dead don't hold grudges, so neither do we.	2																					
26	26		301							1	Watanabe	Those things that used to differentiate soldiers from each other... uniforms, titles, callsigns... they no longer exist.	2																					
27	27		301							1	Watanabe	The soldiers of this era... we fight together, for a common cause.	2

33	33		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Lee	I thought it looked colossal from the distance. But now that we're getting closer—	2																					
34	34		301							1	Lee	The size of it is truly intimidating...	2																					
35	35		301							1	Watanabe	Wouldn't be a doomsday fortress built in the post-Pandemic Age if it didn't have a decent size.	3																					
36	36		301							1	Watanabe	It's different from doomsday fortresses built during the world wars or the cold war era.	3																					
37	37		301							1	Watanabe	The doomsday fortresses built during the Post-Pandemic Age were always designed so that the inhabitants never had to leave if they didn't want to. The owner probably spent lots of money on it.	3

41	41		301							1	Watanabe	Yeah. In the fortress, people could have hidden away from the Punishing Virus...	3																					
42	42		301							1	Watanabe	...The only thing they couldn't hide from was conscription. Besides, the location of this fortress is perfect. With a pair of binoculars, you could surveil the entire bay.	3

44	44		301							1	Karenina	Yeah. When times are tough, humans are worse than any calamity.	1

46	46		301							1	Watanabe	Anyway, we need to find a way inside.	3																					
47	47		301							1	Watanabe	If we want to get into the fortress, we must get through the "counteractive corridors" on the outside.	3																					
48	48		301							1	Watanabe	For an attacker to invade, they would first have to find the fortress' weak points in the counteractive corridors, which are riddled with hardpoints.	3																					
49	49		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Watanabe	The hardpoints should no longer be in use, but... expect lots of roaming Corrupted.	3
