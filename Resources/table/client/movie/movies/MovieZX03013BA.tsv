4	4		301									At the same time, the Omega Weapons are running at their maximum power in the entire battle. The Red Tide that once spread the entire sea surface has been properly contained.

16	16		301									A young male soaked in rain and vital fluid walks forward with the remaining Purifying Force members behind. He nods at Bianca.

21	21		301									Bianca looks around at the remaining members of the Purifying Force, who had suffered a substantial loss after engaging in battles with Hetero-Creatures for days. This young kid is still quite new, but he was forced to take up the role of the temporary captain.																						
22	22		301									Bianca grabs her Swordstaff as she gazes at the giant humanoid in front. Its distorted body has almost inflated to the height of a building.																						
23	23		302								What is that giant humanoid?	24																						
24	24		301								Bianca	The Ascendant has blended Chiko's consciousness with the Hetero-Humanoid's body... In other words, she also forms part of that monster.	1																					
25	25		302								Chiko...	26

35	35		301									With unprecedented might, Bianca gazes at all the Purifying Force members as they gather around in awe. They have never respected and feared their captain so much.																						
36	36		301								Bianca	Vonnegut used Chiko as part of his Hetero-Humanoid experiment, but she was not simply consumed by that monster. Her mind still lives within—	1

73	73		301								Bianca	Maybe just like what you said, "Witch" forms part of me... It is just a necessary chain of my life.	1																					
74	74		301								Bianca	But it doesn't mean I will be constricted by this identity... This sword is here to prove my determination.	1

85	85		301							1	Teddy	Right... Bianca, before the Engineering Force came to the surface, the Science Council asked us to bring your equipment. That woman said you would definitely make use of it.	1

105	105		301								Yarha	You almost scared me to death... I thought the Corrupted had pried open this container.	2																					
106	106		301									It only takes Teddy a few seconds to figure out why.																						
107	107		204							1	13																							
108	108		301								Teddy	Hah... I get it. That woman must be your boss. She must be punishing you for helping us out in the lunar base earlier.	1																					
109	109		301								Yarha	Haha... She said, "Since you broke the zero-point engine, you should serve as a shock absorber to protect this gift." So...	2																					
110	110		301									Looks like Yarha's data of the zero-point engine saved his life. Otherwise, considering Kurono's way of doing things, the man named "Yarha" would have disappeared from the world.

116	116		301							1	Karenina	Is this a... CUB? It has been configured to fit Bianca's Stigmata.	1																					
117	117		301								Yarha	Yep. When expanded, this CUB can let Stigmata ride on it to achieve high-speed maneuver on water surface and low-attitude airspace.	2

122	122		301								Bianca	Chiko's final wish was to let me end her suffering. That wish is also mine.	1																					
123	123		301								Bianca	...I promised her.	1

130	130		301								Lee	The Science Council used the tissues of the Hetero-Hive Mother to develop this device. I must admit, Bianca's new frame is more powerful than most of the Constructs here.	2

148	148		301							1		Bianca looks at Palma and nods with a smile. Her smile looks nothing different from the past. The look of her frame no longer matters, for everyone understands it clearly at this moment—that Bianca is still Bianca, or rather, she is more determined than ever.
