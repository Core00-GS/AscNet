5	5		301									The attack may have failed, but you managed to place a tracker on Atiel.																						
6	6		301									Leaking vital fluid and broken Construct parts are visibly scattered on the white snow. Leaving the battle, the Forest Guard have dispersed, trying to track Atiel's whereabouts.

10	8		301									After tracking her for a short while, however, her trails end abruptly.																						
11	1002		302								Maybe she performed emergency repairs?	9	Looks like we found our place.	11																				
12	9	10	301								Rosetta	If she could, she'd have likely done it on the move, rather than leaving us clues to follow her all the way here.	1																					
13	10	12	301								Diana	This place is likely Atiel's destination. But where...?	2																					
14	11	12	301								Diana	I think so too. But everything looks the same here. How are we going to find her...?	2																					
15	12		301								Rosetta	Up ahead, I think.	1																					
16	13		301									Following the tip of Rosetta's spear, you see a building that you never noticed in the snow before.																						
17	14		301								Diana	What could that place be?	2																					
18	15		301								Rosetta	I don't know, Commandant. But this likely has something to do with Atiel.	1																					
19	1003		302								Let's go.	16
