4	4		301									Murray has already disassembled the large terminal in the archives and connected cables of various sizes to a peculiar-looking module.																						
5	5		301									He looks at the jerry-rigged bionic access terminal and smiles wryly.

7	7		301							1	Murray	Looks like this is the only place to infiltrate Gestalt without being detected.	1																					
8	8		301								Murray	Gestalt is limited by the principal protocols, so it won't intentionally inflict fatal damage to a human consciousness...	1																					
9	9		301								Murray	But who can be sure that Gestalt is still its former self after having evolved for so long?	1

13	13		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Upon doing so, Murray is removed from all his senses as his consciousness falls into a vortex of emptiness.																						
14	14		301									There is only one thought left in Murray's mind as he falls.																						
15	15		301								Murray	If this is what you feel... what Constructs feel when they dive in, then, Lee... I don't envy you.	1																					
16	16		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Murray	...If I had a choice between infiltrating Gestalt and negotiating with some strange Ascendant, I'd probably choose the latter.																						
17	17		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory263.png																								
18	18		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The vortex subsides and Murray finds himself "once again" in Babylonia.

21	21		301								Murray	...Time to get to work.	1																					
22	22		301								Murray	While Gestalt is busy dealing with the intruder and the Gray Ravens...	1																					
23	23		301								Murray	I'll see what secrets I can uncover here.	1																					
24	24		301								Murray	But before I do, I need to be prepared.	1																					
25	25		301									Murray reaches out with both hands toward where he entered, and he opens his hands as if calling upon something—																						
26	26		301								Murray	Start the full band lockdown procedure and activate safe mode for this block.	1																					
27	27		301								Murray	This will deactivate the normal immersion disengagement procedure, but that shouldn't be an issue for you, Lee.	1																					
28	28		301								Murray	...Let's see how Commander Nikola's minions will react.	1																					
29	29		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Murray	After all... only by activating the security mode can I cover my tracks.	1

36	36		301								Asimov	Take a look.	1																					
37	37		301									Asimov points at the screen, which displays a lit-up dot hovering around "Core S-4-2".																						
38	38		301								Asimov	What's this? It just appeared.	1																					
39	39		301								Karenina	That shouldn't be there. That floor is highly isolated—it shouldn't be accessible to external entries...	2																					
40	40		301									While they are busy figuring out the source of the signal, the screen turns blank right before their eyes.																						
41	41		301									And then, the screen displays a massive warning: "Connection rejected."

49	49		301								Karenina	...The ****?	2																					
50	50		301								Asimov	This is not an external problem. All interfaces have been disconnected internally.	1																					
51	51		301								Asimov	It seems like... no one but those already inside can tell what the internal situation of Gestalt is right now.	1
