12	12		301									The white-haired girl lies motionlessly in the sleeping pod, not even twitching her eyes.																						
13	13		201							1	500058																							
14	14		301							1	Engineer	M.I.N.D. stability... passed. M.I.N.D. container pressure... within acceptable limits. Routine Checklist... complete.	1

18	18		301									The sleeping pod begins the air exchange necessary to open the hatch. The inert gas that serves as a barrier is sucked out through the vents of the air conditioning system.																						
19	19		301									Woosh—																						
20	20		301									The fresh air from outside instantaneously replaces the industrial-smelling inert gas. While the white-haired girl likes the sweet-smelling fresh air, she is more accustomed to the smell of the inert gas.

23	23		301							1	Engineer	Air exchange complete. Vital signs... normal.	2																					
24	24		301								Asimov	Whew... That's good.	1																					
25	25		202							1	2				1																			
26	26		301									The white-haired girl's vision is a blur. She sees a young girl timidly approach Asimov, who is working on the equipment, from behind. She does not seem to dare make a sound. A nearby engineer notices and informs Asimov, who turns around.																						
27	27		301								Rosa	...Mr. Asimov, the deep probe of Mr. Chrome's M.I.N.D. has been completed in accordance with the course teachings.

29	29		201							2	500058		450																					
30	30		301							1	Asimov	Alright, I'll head over. I'll leave things here to you.	1																					
31	31		202							1	2				1																			
32	32		301									Asimov is not at all worried that the nine-year-old girl who stands before him will mess things up. She nods, climbs onto Asimov's high seat, and quietly watches his screen.

34	34		201							2	500058		450																					
35	35		301							1	Engineer	Alright, is Mr. Chrome still suffering from the effects of M.I.N.D. deviation?	2																					
36	36		301								Asimov	No, the deviation has been recalibrated by the Gray Raven Commandant.	1																					
37	37		301								Asimov	Based on the readings, there has been no potential for damage or changes found for now. However, we have to be on guard.	1																					
38	38		301								Asimov	Right now, there's only one thing we can be sure of—	1																					
39	39		301									Asimov glances over at Rosa sitting in front of the screen. She is typing something on her terminal while looking at the records on screen.																						
40	40		301								Asimov	The Glory frame's Inver-Device did encounter an abnormal Punishing Virus overload for unknown reasons.	1																					
41	41		301								Asimov	I built a lot of protection into it to prevent such situations, but it still led to this.	1																					
42	42		301								Asimov	Either the frame had previously undetected defects or there was something odd with the "Mother" he was fighting against.	1																					
43	43		301								Asimov	In short, a deep comprehensive probe of Chrome's M.I.N.D. is needed. Whatever the case may be, any such future incidences must be avoided.	1																					
44	44		301								Engineer	Understood. Is the Gray Raven Commandant still able to help out with calibrations?	2																					
45	45		301								Asimov	Unlikely. Medical care may have improved tremendously, but it will still take time for the commandant to fully heal.	1																					
46	46		301								Asimov	Although the medical department has reluctantly agreed to allow the Gray Raven Commandant to move freely under medical supervision, if 【kuroname】 repeats such risky calibration...	1																					
47	47		301								Engineer	...I can imagine how they'll react. They'll probably come after us with their bone saws.	2																					
48	48		301								Engineer	...Alright.	2																					
49	49		301								Asimov	On our end, there are still some things that need to be confirmed, but with Vera taking care of them, I don't foresee too many issues.	1																					
50	50		301								Asimov	Confirm the data and the conclusion. Once that's done, this matter's concluded.	1																					
51	51		301								Engineer	Understood.	2																					
52	52		401							2	1515																							
53	53		301								System	Data confirmation... Memory Beacon grid projection uploaded to server... comparing... average deviation of 0.0014.																						
54	54		401							2	1515																							
55	55		301								System	Within acceptable limits... data reconfirmation complete... checklist complete...																						
56	56		301									The white-haired girl in the sleeping pod completes yet another Babylonia Construct routine inspection. The sleeping pod's glass door slowly opens.																						
57	57		301								Engineer	Good morning, No. 21.	2																					
58	58		202							1	2				1																			
59	59		301								No. 21	...Good morning.																						
60	60		301									No. 21 knows she must be polite to the engineer carrying out maintenance on her.																						
61	61		301									No. 21 springs out of the sleeping pod.																						
62	62		301								No. 21	"Snore."																						
63	63		301									A white creature dashes out from a dark corner of the sleeping pod and runs circles around No. 21.																						
64	64		301									After a couple of circles, the white supporting Co-bot stops, as if remembering something.																						
65	65		301								No. 21	What is it?																						
66	66		301									The supporting Co-bot's head spins before playing a voice message—

69	69		301							1	Vera	Is the inspection complete? If it's done, hurry over to the entrance.	1

72	72		301									No. 21 knows that she has to listen to Vera.																						
73	73		301								No. 21	Okay.																						
74	74		301									Without sparing another glance at the busy Science Council engineers, No. 21 steps out of the Science Council's maintenance department.																						
75	75		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					No. 21 has a mission. Vera is waiting to take her to the location.
