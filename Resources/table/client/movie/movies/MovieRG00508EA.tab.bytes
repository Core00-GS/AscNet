3	3		301								Book of Death	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA																						
4	4		301								Narration	Unable to accept its loss, the Book of Death makes a horrifying growl‚Äî																						
5	5		301								Narration	But that cannot deny its imminent failure. As the battle comes to a rest, the Book of Death inevitably starts to decompose from inside.																						
6	6		301								Book of Death	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA‚ÄîAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA‚ÄîAAAAAAAAAA‚Äî																						
7	7		301								Narration	Its growl soon turns into an disjointed, hoarse moan.																						
8	8		301								Narration	Still, its twisted soul cannot believe that its life is coming to an end. It once was able to feast on human's pain, but not anymore.																						
9	9		301								Narration	Dusty dots begin to show on the Book of Death's cover.																						
10	10		301								Narration	When the dust covers one third of its surface, the growl has stopped. It breaks apart within an instant.																						
11	11		301								Electronic Voice	Multiple [unauthorized] students have passed the final test. Should they be granted with the access to the hidden data section?																						
12	12		301								Narration	Access granted.																						
13	13		301								Electronic Voice	Understood. Congratulations, you have passed the final test of Camp Inferno.																						
14	14		301								Electronic Voice	Stored in the hidden section are Director George D. Toro's notes, original scripts, unprocessed movie cuts, contacts, as well as a letter of guarantee for [unauthorized] students written by himself.																						
15	15		301								Electronic Voice	With the above information, you have everything needed to inherit Director George D. Toro's legacy in the movie industry. The Toro Foundation will also provide unconditional funding for your debut movies.																						
16	16		301								Electronic Voice	Camp Inferno was designed for this purpose all along. Once again, congratulations. You may now log off from this virtual space.

20	20		301								Karenina	Hey! What are you doing in there? It's been so long!																						
21	21		301								Karenina	Babylonia's air conditioning system is back online now. I can't keep this running if you don't come out! The workshop is asking me to go back!																						
22	22		301								Karenina	I don't care what you are doing, just stop it and log out!
