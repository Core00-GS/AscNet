4	4		301									Noan has witnessed the conflicts within Asslam slowly come to a boiling point during the years he has served on the Cargo Crew, a festering wound that tests the boundaries of the people and the law.																						
5	5		301									To stand a chance against the guards from the upper level, Rachel has finally found several weapon suppliers who are willing to work with her after a long period of searching and hard work.																						
6	6		301									Still, there are many desperate people in the lower level who are willing to snitch on them like Bancroft did.																						
7	7		301									The Cargo Crew has to hide the weapons they have procured in different cargos, sending them all across the world with their trucks to keep their plan safe.																						
8	8		301									They will have to wait for the right time before retrieving the weapons.

18	18		301								???	Huh...	2																					
19	19		301								???	I've heard Rachel's distrustful of the people around her. I wasn't expecting it to be so bad that she's making a child captain.	2

34	34		301									Just like how these "Pandora Boxes" were the aristocrats' tool to destroy the lower level, they are now the Cargo Crew's instrument to secure power for the rebellion.																						
35	35		301								???	As long as you guys know what you're doing.	2																					
36	36		301								???	Not counting the ones with the "merch," we somehow sold 31 of these boxes. Can't believe there are still people who fall for these scams.	2

38	38		301								Noan	What about the other items we're selling here?	1																					
39	39		301								???	They're almost out, including your moonshine. Here's the list. You'll find our fee on it.	2																					
40	40		301								Noan	Thanks. And the thing we mentioned last time...	1																					
41	41		301								???	My grandfather said no. The way he put it, you'll only drag him into your fight if he joins you. You'll be asking for supplies or refuge or something else... he'll never hear the end of it.	2																					
42	42		301								???	Further involvement will only put this base at risk. Selling you guys weapons is as far as we go.	2

72	72		301								Bumblebee Captain	So many folks on the train could use a meal, but they wouldn't bring extra hands, so they wouldn't have the extra mouths to feed.	2																					
73	73		301								Bumblebee Captain	I was complaining about the lack of work for all the hungry folks on the train four years ago, but it's worse now. Those who stayed are starving, and those who came out here are worked to death!	2																					
74	74		301								Bumblebee Captain	Time was short, and we had to crunch—two weeks ago, the CPF at the reconstruction site broke down in the middle of the night. We were all working underground, so no one noticed it when the signal light turned red.	2																					
75	75		301								Bumblebee Captain	The engineer at the base spotted it and contacted the "dickheads" overseeing the work. Guess what? Those drunkards were sleeping, and they didn't bother to do anything! So the engineer thought we weren't there!	2

222	222		301							1	???	Never mind. It's impressive that you're still functioning and doing your job as it is. Most can't get into the Cargo Crew at your age, not to mention become a captain.	2																					
223	223		204							1	1																							
224	224		301								Noan	...Thanks for your compliments.	1																					
225	225		301								???	Tch... Already smiling, are we? Are you mellow, or are you just cold-hearted?	2																					
226	226		301								Noan	Neither. I'm busy. I don't have time to be sad.	1																					
227	227		301								???	...I can kinda see why Rachel trusts you on a job this important.	2																					
228	228		301								???	There are still some things I'm curious about, but I'm not sure if it's my place to ask.	2																					
229	229		301								Noan	What is it?	1																					
230	230		301								???	I've been told that supplies are even more scarce on the train than in refugee bases like ours. How has Rachel managed to find so many things to trade?	2																					
231	231		301								Noan	No idea. Rachel has her way, and she won't tell me.	1																					
232	232		301								???	How likely do you think you'll win?	2																					
233	233		301								Noan	No idea. There's still a lot we aren't sure about and many we don't trust. Guessing now is a fool's errand.	1																					
234	234		301								???	That was the last batch of weapons. When are you going to act?	2																					
235	235		301								Noan	No idea. That's up to Rachel.	1																					
236	236		301								???	You have no idea about anything, and you still carry on. Are you that eager to die?	2																					
237	237		301								Noan	No. There's a reason Captain Rachel doesn't tell anyone any details.	1																					
238	238		301								Noan	The aristocrats have known what we're up to for a while. Failing to find any evidence, all they can do is pressure us and keep searching. Should they get ahold of anything, the consequences will be dire.	1																					
239	239		301								Noan	If you're curious, why don't you agree with Captain Rachel's proposal? Mr. Bethe and you are both merchants she's collaborated with secretly for a long time. Perhaps she'll make an exception and tell you her plan?	1																					
240	240		301								Noan	Having a refugee base to support us continuously will give us something reliable to fall back on. You've already planned to cover for us, after all.	1																					
241	241		301								???	Grandfather said no, and that means no. You can owe me a favor for covering for you. It has nothing to do with my grandfather or the base.	2																					
242	242		301									She looks down in silence briefly.																						
243	243		301								???	Grandfather said you are destined to fail. You're all one step away from your graves.	2																					
244	244		301								???	Any instability at Akdilek will impact the bases greatly. If you all lose, our trades will also be affected.	2																					
245	245		301								???	Not to mention the elderly on the train, and the other kids like you...	2																					
246	246		301								Noan	Better a corpse than a servant and an accomplice to those aristocrats.	1																					
247	247		301								???	...Is that something a kid your age gets to say?	2																					
248	248		301								Noan	That's what everyone else says. I just take after them.	1																					
249	249		301								???	Speaking of which, everyone on your team is older than you. Do they listen to you?	2																					
250	250		301								Noan	They don't have to. I only made captain because I got along with the people around me.	1																					
251	251		301								Noan	They're not impressed with what I can do—they simply support and trust me as their comrade. I listen to them as often as they listen to me. We're all equal.	1																					
252	252		301								???	Equal...? I was expecting more arrogance from a kid like you! How old are you?	2																					
253	253		301								Noan	18 next summer.	1																					
254	254		301								???	And I thought you were no older than 14. I guess you're still waiting for your growth spurt... Well, do your best and live. You still owe me one.	2																					
255	255		301								Noan	Thanks. I appreciate it.	1																					
256	256		301									Nodding sincerely, Noan has no idea how he will come to regret his promise in the future.																						
257	257		301								Noan	What's your name?	1																					
258	258		301								Bella	I'm Bella. Last name's Bethe, like my grandfather. Bella Bethe.	2

269	269		301								Noan	She only ever talked about old Mr. Bethe, Miss Bethe.	1																					
270	270		301								Bella Bethe	Bethe is fine. I'm older than you but not old enough for honorifics.	2

272	272		301								Noan	Alright, Bethe.	1																					
273	273		301									—That will be his first and last time to call Bella by that name.
