3	3		301			DialogEnable						As the battle gets more intensified, the area around the CPF, which was relatively safe, is shrouded in gunfire.																						
4	4		301									The continuous explosions shatter the shelter where Wanshi has been hiding. He rushes out while the firepower from the Corrupted weakens, trying not to be buried by the collapsed shelter,running toward the building on the side which seems to be safer.																						
5	5		301									Halfway there, Wanshi sees a badly injured Construct on the ground. His frame is covered with scars from the Corrupted attacks.																						
6	2000		401							2	10001004																							
7	6		301									He can hardly move due to the bombing earlier. He has to lean on a brick, shooting at the crowd of Corrupted in the distance with a rifle.																						
8	7		301									However, the trigger is soon stuck as the rifle jams after prolonged use in battles. So he throws the rifle out and knocks down several Corrupted down in the distance.																						
9	8		301									Seeing this, Wanshi rushes to the Construct and takes the maintenance kit out.																						
10	9		201							1	500289	7																						
11	10		301							1	Wanshi	Stay put. I'll treat you now.	1

14	13		202							1					1																			
15	14		301									Wanshi pulls out the connection wires from the maintenance kit and connects them to the Construct. He can see more clearly now that the power of the Construct is rapidly decreasing.																						
16	15		301									Watching this, the Construct suddenly grabs Wanshi's hands as he is about to treat his wounds, and tries to point to his chest and vocal module with the other hand.																						
17	16		301									Following the direction of the Construct's finger, Wanshi sees appalling tears in his chest and vocal module, where vital fluid keeps flowing out onto the ground.																						
18	17		201							1	500289	7																						
19	18		301							1	Wanshi	...Are you trying to say something?	1																					
20	19		301									The Construct nods.																						
21	20		301								Wanshi	But the damage to the other parts is more...	1																					
22	21		301									The Construct shakes his head.																						
23	22		301								Wanshi	...	1																					
24	23		202							1					1																			
25	24		301									Wanshi falls silent after understanding the Construct's intention. He takes out the tools from the maintenance kit and quickly begins fixing the vocal module for him.																						
26	25		301									However, the power index to the side is a constant reminder of the little time Wanshi has left.

34	33		202							1					1																			
35	34		301									The Construct reaches out and takes down Thompson's pistol on Wanshi's waist, trembling as he places it in Wanshi's hands.																						
36	35		201							1	500297																							
37	36		301							1	Fallen Construct	Lift it... up...	1																					
38	37		301									The Construct gently holds Wanshi's arm up with the back of his hand. Wanshi grasps the pistol as he has asked and slowly raises his arm.																						
39	38		301								Fallen Construct	You arm needs to... be parallel to your shoulder... Right... that's it.	1																					
40	39		301								Fallen Construct	Face... to the front, and let your eyes focus on the crosshair and... those monsters.	1																					
41	40		301									Wanshi adjusts his posture step by step following the Construct's instructions and finally aims his pistol at the crowd of Corrupted in the distance.																						
42	41		301								Fallen Construct	Put your index finger... on the trigger, and... cough... steady...	1																					
43	42		301									The Construct holds Wanshi's hand, correcting the direction of the crosshair little by little.																						
44	43		201							1	500289	7																						
45	44		301							1	Wanshi	I...	1																					
46	45		201							1	500297

48	47		202							1					1																			
49	48		401							2	1510																							
50	49		301									The Construct's hand grips slightly harder and Wanshi finally pulls the trigger. The bullet flies off and accurately pierces the memory shell of the Corrupted.																						
51	50		301									The recoil from the pistol kicks Wanshi's arm high. The Construct can no longer hold on and his arm drops to the ground.																						
52	51		301									Among the sound of gunfire and explosion, Wanshi still hears the last words of the Construct.																						
53	52		201							1	500297

61	58		301									But they are all child's plays compared to reality.																						
62	59		301									The battlefield is a slaughterhouse. There is no glory or honor, just merciless slaughter and death.																						
63	60		301									The recoil from the pistol makes my wrist numb. Everywhere I look, the Corrupted are ceaselessly entangled in fights against the Constructs, leaving mechanical remains behind.																						
64	61		301									The ricochets flying past my head are mixed with mechanical parts. When all is set and done, it is impossible to tell whether the burnt mechanical arm fallen to the ground belongs to a Corrupted or a Construct.																						
65	62		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The roar of the Corrupted, mixed with the sound of gunfire and weapons clashing, keeps tickling my eardrums, but they gradually fade.

101	94		301									I cannot make a difference in this harsh reality. I knew it all along.																						
102	95		301									He closes his eyes.																						
103	96		301									Jett, Hall, Raphaelan, Zetus...																						
104	97		301									I have vivid memories of the sadness, anger, fear, and happiness of every wounded Construct I have ever treated.																						
105	98		301									But eventually, all those emotions end in death, forming a swamp of endless cycles.

133	123		301									After finishing the maintenance, Wanshi and Thompson put away all sorts of maintenance tools scattered on the ground.																						
134	124		301								Thompson	Do you have children?	2

136	125		301								Wanshi	Huh? No, I'm not even...	1																					
137	126		301								Thompson	Haha, sure. Just asking. Don't be nervous.	2																					
138	127		301								Thompson	I was married when I was your age. Here, this is my son.	2																					
139	1006		401							2	1515																							
140	128		301									Thompson taps his wrist as he says it, and a projection of a white-haired child appears between them.																						
141	129		301									The child in the projection is clinging to the ball in his arms without looking at the camera. Around the child is a Babylonia park styled after the Golden Age.

143	130		301								Wanshi	Aren't you... a Construct?	1																					
144	131		301								Thompson	What are you thinking? I had him with my wife before I was turned into a Construct.	2																					
145	132		301								Thompson	Later, as the war was getting more fierce, I submitted a rebuilding request to the army.	2																					
146	133		301								Thompson	But that's beside the point. Do you know why he looks so angry in the projection?	2																					
147	134		301								Wanshi	Um... No idea.	1																					
148	135		301								Thompson	Because I failed to keep my promise.	2																					
149	136		301								Thompson	The children are growing up full of spirits even though the war outside is fierce.	2																					
150	137		301								Thompson	The coaching center organized a ball game and I promised him that I'd go watch it.	2																					
151	562		204							1																								
152	138		301								Wanshi	Sounds like something to be happy about.	1																					
153	139		301								Thompson	But it turned out I was still out on the surface when the match happened.	2																					
154	140		301								Thompson	After I went back, all my equipment, my bed, and everything I owned were packed and thrown out of my house.	2																					
155	141		301								Thompson	They wouldn't let me in, you know. I couldn't just open my door with a grenade in a residential area.	2																					
156	142		301								Thompson	So I had to go back to my dorm in the army during my vacation, where I spent a week in simulation training alone.	2																					
157	143		301								Thompson	The consequence of failing to keep a promise is serious, especially one with a child.	2																					
158	144		301								Thompson	You've got to remember it when you're around children in the future.	2																					
159	145		301								Wanshi	Children... children...?	1																					
160	160		202							1	2				1

162	170		201							1	500019																							
163	171		301							1	Thompson	It took me a long time to find out why he was upset.	1																					
164	172		301								Thompson	Children at the age are starting to have thoughts that they don't wanna share with their parents.	1																					
165	173		301								Thompson	The small matter that seems irrelevant to others often means a lot to them.	1																					
166	174		301								Thompson	I decided to go to war for the future of my child.	1																					
167	175		301								Thompson	But it's also the parents' duty to guide their own children, as we're their role models and flags.	1																					
168	176		301								Thompson	Don't you think you're a lot like him in some ways? You aren't willing to talk to others when you're upset.	1																					
169	177		201							1	500289	7																						
170	178		301							1	Wanshi	I...	1

172	180		301							1	Thompson	Though it was part of my fault, I didn't regret it.	1																					
173	601		301								Thompson	I stayed behind with my partners as the Corrupted launched a new round of attack just when I was about to return.	1																					
174	181		301								Thompson	Compared to my child's match, it's more important to save the partners in front of me.	1																					
175	182		301								Thompson	Perhaps some people could handle everything at ease, but not me.	1																					
176	183		301								Thompson	So instead of worrying or regretting it, I choose to do what I'm capable of first.	1

180	187		301								Wanshi	Then it's better if you hold your left hand still.	2																					
181	191		301								Wanshi	Well... let me adjust it for you.	2																					
182	192		301								Thompson	Thanks.	1																					
183	565		204							2																								
184	193		301								Wanshi	You're not exactly excellent in combat, so why do you go up to the front?	2																					
185	194		301								Thompson	Because it's what we should do on the surface.	1																					
186	195		301								Thompson	To save our wounded partners off the battlefield and fight side by side with them on it.	1																					
187	196		301								Thompson	Besides, it's something I promised my child. We made a pact that one day he could breathe and run on Earth.	1																					
188	197		301								Thompson	The Support Constructs have never been the sharpest blades on the field, but they are the most essential part.	1																					
189	566		204							2	7																							
190	198		301								Wanshi	...Why do you say so?	2																					
191	199		301								Thompson	Because we're a "flag."	1																					
192	200		301								Thompson	We're their biggest inspiration, their mightiest elixir.	1																					
193	201		301								Thompson	Just like the Star of Life guiding the wounded in the darkness with its faint starlight.	1																					
194	202		301								Thompson	People wouldn't have to be afraid of getting hurt when we are here, and they can charge to the front without worries. As everyone knows, the Support Constructs will be their strongest backup.	1																					
195	630		204							2																								
196	203		301								Wanshi	It's just supporting...	2																					
197	204		301								Thompson	Supporting is not as easy as you imagine.	1																					
198	205		301								Thompson	It's to provide proper offensive assistance for Attackers, rather than getting in the way.	1																					
199	206		301								Thompson	You must understand and familiarize everyone's fighting style and rhythm. It's not something you can find in textbooks.	1																					
200	207		301								Thompson	It's something you'll only learn with time by standing on the same battlefield with everyone else, bathing in blood and sweat.	1																					
201	208		301								Wanshi	Is that why you detonated the EMP with bare hands during the battle earlier?	2																					
202	209		301								Thompson	How do you know that?	1																					
203	210		301								Wanshi	I heard from the Constructs coming back from the east front.	2																					
204	211		301								Thompson	Haha, do you feel different?	1																					
205	213		301								Thompson	After experiencing death and coming back, we're all much closer than before. You never thought that we Constructs would tell this kind of thing to a human like you before that battle, right?	1																					
206	214		301								Wanshi	...	2																					
207	215		301									Hearing what Thompson has said, Wanshi turns silent, not realizing that the adjustment has been completed at some point. Thompson flexes his left hand.																						
208	216		301								Thompson	Impressive. The influence of the EMP has been completely removed.	1																					
209	217		301								Wanshi	That's something I don't deserve...	2
