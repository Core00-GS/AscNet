7	5		301									Unlike Alpha, methodical in her steps and positioning, Rosetta completely ignores the conventional to and fro of battle, and merely charges, over and over at Alpha.																						
8	6		301									An all-in strategy. Throwing herself at Alpha, threatening to consume her through the whistling spear tip, a comet of her humanoid-hybrid bulk and speed.																						
9	7		301									Full of openings, but it locks Alpha in combat with her, denying her retreat, hanging on her the threat to crucify her whole. Alpha can only stay and answer Rosetta's blows, her blade poised to parry and deflect.																						
10	8		301									Rosetta's limit will come. Because the world is made of patterns, eternally repeating themselves. Even chaos has its own rules, let alone Rosetta's lunges.

16	12		301									Syncing, breathing, "becoming," the opponent. She catches the fatal pause—the nadir of her breath—and the blade passes, fluidly sliding into Rosetta's torso.

28	22		301									With all of her remaining strength, Rosetta grabs Alpha's blade tight, keeping it within her. It was all part of the plan from the very start.																						
29	23		301									——If I can't best you, I can at least take you with me.																						
30	24		301									The golden particles—Rosetta's trump card in this fight—swim around the air. Rosetta's assertive smile flickers off of the gold dust.
