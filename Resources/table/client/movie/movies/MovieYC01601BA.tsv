16	16		301									If humanity is wiped out, their remains will be buried deep underground, or turned into dust and stored in vessels. The earth and stone tablets will remember that they once existed.

30	28		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						She's there today, too.																						
31	29		301									As usual, during her rehabilitation training in the training room, her skill with a blade is as awe-inspiring and exacting as when I first met her on the battlefield.																						
32	30		301									The leader said that training logs shouldn't contain extraneous details. But this is my log, so he can go cry about it.																						
33	31		301									Now, where was I? Oh, her eyes were as cold as ever, but there was a trace of loneliness.																						
34	32		301									I don't know why, but I think I understand her loneliness. I heard that Lucia was seriously wounded during her last mission, and her entire team and commandant died except for her.																						
35	33		301									Ever since then, she appeared to be unaffected, but I sensed a change in her.																						
36	34		301									Now, she is the only remaining member of her Gray Raven team.																						
37	35		301									I would've loved for the opportunity to fight at her side. With this in mind, I remained in the training room once training was over.																						
38	36		301									What was I doing at that time? Oh, right. I was waiting in the doorway to say hello to Lucia. Wait, no. I first gave her a salute, then said hello.																						
39	37		301									Then I complimented Lucia's achievements, expressed my appreciation for her—for the Gray Ravens—then put forward my wish to join the Gray Ravens.																						
40	38		301									...Or should I say, I wanted to, but I ended up just staring at Lucia as she left the training room. She didn't even look my way as she walked passed me.																						
41	39		301									After being too shy to ask, I missed my opportunity and had no other choice but to submit my application to the Gray Ravens. I was rejected, of course. That's why I was assigned to my current team.																						
42	40		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Why would the renowned Gray Raven team need a mediocre member like me...

Most of my missions are just cleaning up Corrupted around the conservation area, setting up equipment, investigating Corrupted, and then submitting reports to the special exploration squads.																						
48	46		301									The commandant seems to deliberately forbid me from undertaking more difficult missions. Maybe since I'm not as strong as our leader and Teresa, I'll just end up getting in the way during more important assignments.																						
49	47		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					So I have to train harder. Even if I can't fight alongside Lucia, I can't hold back my team members.

54	52		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Today's my lucky day! I saw Lucia again in the training room.																						
55	53		301									I finally got to see Lucia unleash "Dawn". Seems like she's getting ready for a mission on the ground.																						
56	54		301									Her crimson pigtails and the red light trails emitted by the high-powered frame were so dazzling that I couldn't look away.																						
57	55		301									But something was up with Lucia. I heard someone from the tech department say that she wanted to modify the frame's hairstyle.																						
58	56		301									I don't think that's a good idea, though. I think she's lovely just the way she is!																						
59	57		301									I wish someone would tell her that. I'm too much of a chicken to do it myself.																						
60	58		301									Lucia's been acting differently, though. She used to have this cold, empty look in her eyes as if fighting was the only thing she was meant to do.																						
61	59		301									But recently, there seems to be something else besides emptiness in her eyes. She still occasionally drifts off, but someone always comes looking for her to drag her off to somewhere noisy.																						
62	60		301									Sometimes there's a quiet and delicate-looking girl who I'm guessing is a member of the Gray Ravens. Sometimes there's a hot-headed girl always clamoring to one-up Lucia.																						
63	61		301									Most of the time, it's the Gray Ravens' new commandant always talking to Lucia with a gentle smile. She used to be really tense, but she seems to have loosened up more than ever.																						
64	62		301									There's also the Strike Hawk member who always looks like he's giggling from behind. He runs off to the Gray Ravens' base even more than me, but then he just ends up getting dragged back by the captain of the Strike Hawks.																						
65	63		301									But he always bursts in through the door while I try to pass by unnoticed.																						
66	64		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Before I knew it, Lucia had quite the entourage.

73	69		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Before that, I never considered the possibility that I will die.																						
74	70		301									Death is inevitable for humans, but I'm a Construct.																						
75	71		301									As those who modified us into Constructs said, we can recall our consciousnesses if we are seriously injured in battle.																						
76	72		301									Once recalled, we will wake up in a new frame and continue to fight another day.																						
77	73		301									Recalling does have one side effect, though. Our combat data will take precedence over other memory data during recall. If there is any error with the recall process, we may end up losing memories.																						
78	74		301									But based on what our battle-hardened predecessors have said, there isn't enough time to recall on the battlefield. Each moment of hesitation during war determines its outcome and your companions' survival. That's one of the cruelties of war.																						
79	75		301									If I recall on the battlefield, will I still be "me" when I wake up in a maintenance pod in Babylonia?																						
80	76		301									The captain was furious. He said that I needed to get my head out of the clouds. My commandant won't always be able to stop and adjust my M.I.N.D.																						
81	77		301									I can only bow my head and apologize to the captain. The commandant spoke up for me, but that only makes me feel even more guilty.																						
82	78		301									If it weren't for the commandant and captain of this mission, I might have died from the attacking Corrupted. I wasn't expecting to encounter falling Hetero-Core shards during such a routine mission. The shards ended up luring a horde of Corrupted.																						
83	79		301									I couldn't keep my mind from wandering. Even I didn't know from where the fear in the bottom of my heart came .																						
84	80		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Maybe I'm not suitable to be a soldier at all. No wonder the Gray Ravens wouldn't let me join.

165	159		301									She's not the mysterious Ascendant, but rather Lucia, the one I had always longed to meet.																						
166	160		301									...But now, I looked like a Corrupted in her eyes.

168	162		301									My movements awaken the surrounding Corrupted from their dormant slumber, triggering their combat mode upon detecting an intruder.																						
169	163		301									After eliminating the Corrupted around the commandant, Lucia finally notices me.																						
170	164		301									She walks in front of me before finally seeing me clearly.																						
171	165		301									She looks different from what I remember. Her frame is something I had never seen before.

173	167		301									And sure enough, the hairstyle really suits her. Who knows if anyone told her.
