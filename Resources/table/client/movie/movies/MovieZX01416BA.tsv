4	4		301			DialogEnable				1		In the surreal projection of M.I.N.D. space, you see another Amberia—the real Amberia.																						
5	5		301									Guided by the narwhal's voice, you see the true master of the bionics, Amberia, in the deepest recesses of her mind, festered by nightmares.																						
6	6		301								Amberia	Who is it...? You're not Derek? Who are you?	1																					
7	1000		302								(Explain)	7																						
8	7		301								Amberia	【kuroname】, commandant from Babylonia.	1																					
9	8		301								Amberia	I know why you are here, but I decline your request.	1																					
10	9		301								Amberia	I won't stop the bionics... And I won't sleep again. I don't want to dream anymore.	1																					
11	10		301								Amberia	I'm going outside. I'm going to open my eyes and escape from this place.	1																					
12	1001		302								Are you not going berserk?	11	If you promise not to hurt anyone else.	13																				
13	11	12	301								Amberia	Berserk... You call this fear of mine, berserk?	1																					
14	12	16	301								Amberia	I'm just trying to protect myself! Protect myself from those people!	1																					
15	13	14	301								Amberia	Hurt others... No, I never wanted to hurt anyone. I just wanted the ones that hurt me gone...	1																					
16	14	15	301								Amberia	You'd do the same in my shoes. I'm going to eliminate the ARU and everything that stands in my way. That way, I won't be imprisoned in this ice cave ever again.	1																					
17	15	16	301								Amberia	I don't want anyone to call me a monster ever again!	1																					
18	16		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Amberia	So... As long as you have the code, 【kuroname】, I will never let you leave this place!	1

21	18		301							1	Amberia (Atiel)	Ngh... Where am I...	1																					
22	1003		201							1	500214	1																						
23	19		301							1	Rosetta	Looks like Commandant's succeeded. The pain in my M.I.N.D. is easing...	1																					
24	20		301									During Rosetta's defensive bout, she suddenly finds a massive weight lifted from her M.I.N.D. A glance at the Polar Soldier, silent in the rear, tells her that 【kuroname】 has entered the depths of Amberia's M.I.N.D.																						
25	1004		201							1	500209																							
26	21		301							1	Amberia (Atiel)	How did you squirm out of my hold? Wait, why is my frame so slow!	1		1																			
27	1005		201							1	500214	1																						
28	22		301							1	Rosetta	Thank the commandant. Also, weren't you just in misery as well?	1																					
29	1006		201							1	500209																							
30	23		301							1	Amberia (Atiel)	Hmph... That was just pain caused by M.I.N.D. integration. Once it is complete, Amberia will no longer exist, and I can perfectly control this frame!	1																					
31	1007		201							1	500214	5																						
32	24		301							1	Rosetta	Then you'll become the monster in Amberia's stead. Won't you?	1																					
33	1008		201							1	500209																							
34	25		301							1	Amberia (Atiel)	...I am not a—MONSTER!	1

36	1010		401							2	10002001																							
37	26		301									Verbal and armed exchanges fly in the air. With Amberia's M.I.N.D. integration paused, Rosetta can finally make use of her lightning-fast speed and destructive power to gain an upper hand.																						
38	1011		201							1	500214	5																						
39	27		301							1	Rosetta	If you're not a monster, why do you want to become Amberia and destroy your home?!	1																					
40	1012		201							1	500209																							
41	28		301							1	Amberia (Atiel)	Take a look at yourself...! Why would you protect those bastards!	1																					
42	1013		201							1	500214	5																						
43	29		301							1	Rosetta	Because I love this snowland; the feeling of snow beneath my feet... I want to be proud of this place.	1																					
44	1014		201							1	500209																							
45	30		301							1	Amberia (Atiel)	What?	1																					
46	1015		201							1	500214	14																						
47	31		301							1	Rosetta	I've always believed that the ARU can change. I thought I could find this change through the outside world.	1																					
48	32		301								Rosetta	But when I got out, I realized... We ourselves, have to be the change we want to see.	1																					
49	1016		204							1	4																							
50	33		301								Rosetta	Putting the past to rest to prevent another tragedy like you and me—that is my answer!	1																					
51	34		301									Rosetta throws a thrust at Amberia's upper body, but before it could connect, Atiel regains control of her frame and swipes Rosetta away.																						
52	1017		401							2	1506																							
53	35		301			PanelActor1Shake				1	Rosetta	How unlucky...	1																					
54	36		301									Rosetta is knocked to the ground. Her light wings have softened the impact, but she still crashes into an icicle.																						
55	1018		201							1	500209																							
56	37		301							1	Amberia (Atiel)	Always going on about your luck. I am—Amberia is—the actual unlucky one!	1																					
57	1019		201							1	500214																							
58	38		301							1	Rosetta	Indeed. By unlucky, I meant you two.	1																					
59	1020		201							1	500209																							
60	39		301							1	Amberia (Atiel)	Huh?	1																					
61	1021		201							1	500214	8																						
62	40		301							1	Rosetta	I've always thought the entire world was down on its luck. That's why the Punishing Virus broke out. That's why I have no choice but to defeat you.	1																					
63	41		301								Rosetta	Because we're all marred by misfortune, that's why we all suffer. This is why we are bound...	1																					
64	1022		201							1	500209																							
65	42		301							1	Amberia (Atiel)	Rosetta... Spare the talk. Do you think you can defeat Amberia, the "perfect" humanoid-hybrid Construct?!	1																					
66	44		301									The particles emitted by Rosetta's light wings disperse, forming a thin reflective film over the fractured ice.																						
67	45		301									Rosetta's mixed expression, taken by hints of sadness, can be seen on the glinting ice.																						
68	1023		201							1	500214	5																						
69	46		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Rosetta	I'm not just defeating you! I'm going forward!	1
