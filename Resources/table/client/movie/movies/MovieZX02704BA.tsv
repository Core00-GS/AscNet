65	65		301									Haicma looks at the people who are traveling against the current like her, and they seem like pebbles thrown into a river, creating small ripples before being flooded by a scarlet stream.																						
66	66		301									Haicma knows that humans consider those people to be "absolutely obedient."																						
67	67		301									Why would they do that? Is it because of "commands"? Haicma quickly rejects this hypothesis as her massive database shows that there has never been a command that can make a human "absolutely obedient."																						
68	68		301									Is it their "essence," then? Just like how machines act according to their underlying protocols, perhaps humans also act according to a similar core principle.																						
69	69		301									Even when they are different beings with different experiences, these people all make the same choice at that particular moment. Do they have the same "essence"? But what about the "uniqueness" of each individual?

97	97		301									The temperature of her frame has long risen past the safety threshold. The air surrounding her distorts from the heat, but Haicma has no intention to stop the simulation.
