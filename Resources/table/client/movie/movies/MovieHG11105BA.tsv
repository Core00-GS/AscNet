9	9		301								Letter	I remember hearing good things about the Gray Ravens, but they are far kinder than I imagined.																						
10	10		301								Letter	There are quite a lot of differences between their behavior and those on the Engine, but I will adapt.																						
11	11		201							1	500127																							
12	12		301							1	Sophia	Your Grace... No, I should cross that out.	1																					
13	13		301								Sophia	Jamilah, I still don't quite understand why you dispatched me to Babylonia...	1																					
14	14		301								Sophia	I know I'm an envoy, but I'm not skilled in diplomacy. I didn't even learn to read and write until I became a bodyguard.	1																					
15	15		301								Sophia	Not to mention... I... feel like I have more and more classes to make up...	1																					
16	16		301								Sophia	Sometimes, I even feel like it was a mistake to send me to Babylonia.	1																					
17	17		301								Sophia	...No, I can't say that. I'll cross it out.	1																					
18	18		301								Sophia	...But royal bodyguards never ask questions. We just carry out orders.	1																					
19	19		301								Sophia	So, everything is going well here.	1																					
20	20		301								Sophia	How are things on the Engine? Is everything okay?	1																					
21	21		202							1					1																			
22	22		301								Letter	Your Gr... Your last letter said that the anti-royalists were captured. So, the unrest on the Engine must have been solved.																						
23	23		301								Letter	Now, it's time to start the long process of reform according to your vision.																						
24	24		301								Letter	Once reformed, the Engine will finally be what you envisioned.																						
25	25		301								Letter	I'll return and see it for myself when the first helium-3 transport craft leaves.																						
26	26		201							1	500127																							
27	27		301							1	Sophia	As for the question you mentioned in the last letter, I... I don't know how to answer you.	1																					
28	28		301								Sophia	But the Gray Raven Commandant said that "I don't know" was also an answer.	1																					
29	29		301								Sophia	So, my answer is: "Current me doesn't know how to answer."	1																					
30	30		301								Sophia	Strange... Past me wouldn't have hesitated to say "execute"...	1																					
31	31		301								Sophia	After all, they're my lead... Jamilah's enemy. Enemies must be destroyed.	1																					
32	32		202							1					1																			
33	33		301								Letter	But I thought about what you said to me before I left...																						
34	34		301								Letter	"I hope what comes back is no longer my sword or my doll, but a girl who sees the world for what it truly is."																						
35	35		301								Letter	I... still don't know what you mean. You have given me life and hope. I only wish to be your sword.																						
36	36		301								Letter	If you have time, please write back and tell me the exact reason for sending me here.																						
37	37		201							1	500127																							
38	38		301							1	Sophia	From S…oph…ia	1																					
39	39		301								Sophia	...Phew.	1																					
40	40		301								Sophia	...It still looks a little strange.	1																					
41	41		301								Sophia	But if I scratch out any more... I'll rip the paper.	1

48	48		301								Sophia	...President!	2																					
49	49		301								Hassen	Outside of working hours, just call me Mr. Hassen.	1																					
50	50		301								Hassen	—Even though I came to speak with you about work.	1																					
51	51		301								Sophia	You mean... My transfer request?	2																					
52	52		301								Hassen	Correct. You've applied to be transferred out of the Gray Ravens to a new squad. I came to hear why.	1																					
53	53		301								Sophia	I... can't keep up with them in battle.	2																					
54	54		301								Hassen	Is that so? I asked Liv for the log of your last mission.	1																					
55	55		301								Hassen	Based on the battle log, it's hard to say who couldn't keep up.	1																					
56	56		301								Hassen	Regardless, that's not important now. Where do you want to be transferred?	1																					
57	57		301								Sophia	...I'd like to be transferred to Cerberus if possible.	2																					
58	58		301								Hassen	I see. A knife belongs with other knives. Is that it?	1																					
59	59		301								Sophia	...Correct. I don't think I'm suitable for the Gray Ravens.	2																					
60	60		301								Hassen	But since Jamilah sent you here... Do you think she really wants you to be like a dagger?	1																					
61	61		301								Sophia	...!	2

65	65		301								Hassen	I've got bad news, though. I don't know which filing cabinet Celica stuffed your transfer request in.	1																					
66	66		301								Hassen	Celica may need a few days before she can process it.	1																					
67	67		301								Hassen	I'm going to get going.	1
