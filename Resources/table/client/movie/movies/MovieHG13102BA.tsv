7	7		301									Waves of snow part to either side to reveal a path as the vehicle is revved through the snow, evoking to mind the Exodus—where the Israelites walked through the Red Sea parted by Moses.																						
8	8		301									The ice flakes and snow are now coming down at the speed of a shower, making it impossible for you to see the path ahead even with the windshield wiper working away at top speed.																						
9	9		302								We can't see a single thing...	10																						
10	10		301									While you let out a defeated sigh from the front passenger seat, Bianca, fully concentrated behind the wheel, is in control of the accelerator and gear shift with astounding dexterity.																						
11	11		201							1	500533																							
12	12		301							1	Bianca	You seem like you have something to say, Commandant.	1																					
13	13		302								I'm just a little surprised at how well you drive, Bianca.	14	Are we going to be able to make it to the research station just fine?	16																				
14	14		204							1	1																							
15	15	18	301								Bianca	It's just something I have to be able to do for missions. You can't find a better driver than a Construct given the conditions.	1																					
16	16		204							1	1																							
17	17		301								Bianca	So far so good, and we should be able to get there just fine if nothing happens on the way...	1																					
18	18		301								Bianca	I'm pretty used to weather like this from all the snowstorms I've had to brave.	1																					
19	19		302								As a member of the Purifying Force, I assume?	20																						
20	20		204							1																								
21	21		301									She shakes her head.																						
22	22		204							1	8

32	32		301									Before Bianca even finishes her sentence, the vehicle takes a sharp fall.																						
33	33		302								!?	34																						
34	34		401							1	50																							
35	35		301									The fall sends your body plunging forward and the airbag from the front passenger seat popping out, blocking out your view entirely.																						
36	36		301									When the vehicle finally comes to a halt, you look up—and see that half of the vehicle is now in snow sludge.																						
37	37		201							1	500533	5																						
38	38		301							1	Bianca	Commandant, are you okay?!	1																					
39	39		302								I-I'm fine...	40																						
40	40		204							1	8																							
41	41		301								Bianca	I am... very sorry.	1																					
42	42		301								Bianca	I didn't see that big hole just now...	1																					
43	43		204							1	5																							
44	44		301								Bianca	My visual enhancement module is able to capture and recreate everything in my surroundings, except the hole was almost buried entirely out of sight by the snow... which is why I thought the ground was solid.	1																					
45	45		401						800	2	885																							
46	46		402							885																								
47	47		301									Bianca steps on the accelerator, but the wheels are just slipping in the sludge.																						
48	48		302								It wasn't your fault.	49																						
49	49		301									Failing to see hidden holes is a common occurrence when driving in the snow, not to mention that you've been driving through a snowstorm. If anything, you consider yourselves lucky for having come such a long way without anything going wrong.																						
50	50		302								What are we going to do now?	51																						
51	51		301								Bianca	I... think it's going to be very challenging for us to get the vehicle out now.	1																					
52	52		301									The standard procedure would first be to manually remove the snow from around the wheels, and then to place something on the ground to increase friction.																						
53	53		301									Considering the current precipitation and the fact that it's close to minus 50 degrees Celsius, however, you just don't think that's plausible, not to mention that the hole itself is about three-meter wide.																						
54	54		302								Seems like we'll have to go the rest of the way on foot, then.	55																						
55	55		301									This isn't your first time going on a mission in a polar region, and this much you know—every second spent out here puts you a step closer to death.																						
56	56		301									Looking down at the portable terminal on your arm, you see that you're less than two kilometers away from the research station—a distance shorter even than your usual morning jog, but more challenging in more ways than one.																						
57	57		301								Bianca	...Roger that. We'll just come back later for the vehicle, then.	1																					
58	58		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She doesn't need further explanation to know that this is the best option now.

63	63		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You and Bianca manage to open the doors with some struggle. Then, after grabbing a case containing an inflatable tent and heater out of the trunk, you make your way out of the hole toward where your terminal is pointing.																						
64	64		201							1	500533	8																						
65	65		301							1	Bianca	...	1																					
66	66		301									With the wind and snow ruffling your hair, you cast a glance at Bianca—who now looks more serious than ever.																						
67	67		302								Is everything okay?	68																						
68	68		301								Bianca	...Yes.	1																					
69	69		301									After what seems like an eternity, she opens her mouth to speak again.																						
70	70		204							1	5																							
71	71		301								Bianca	Again, Commandant... you have my apologies.	1																					
72	72		301								Bianca	None of these would have happened had I been more careful.	1																					
73	73		302								Don't be so harsh on yourself, Bianca.	74	It happens.	75																				
74	74	76	301								Bianca	I understand that blaming myself isn't going to help with anything—but we are risking your life out here in the snow, all because I didn't see the hole.	1																					
75	75		301								Bianca	It's something I totally should have seen coming.	1																					
76	76		204							1	8																							
77	77		301								Bianca	I'll keep it in mind and won't let it happen ever again.	1																					
78	78		302								Well, if you really are sorry...	79																						
79	79		302								I think I'd feel a lot better hearing the rest of your story from just now.	80																						
80	80		204							1	7																							
81	81		301								Bianca	You mean... about my past, right?	1																					
82	82		302								The body apparently gets warmer when you listen to people talk.	83	I'm just curious.	85																				
83	83		301									This, of course, is an excuse with no root whatsoever in science.																						
84	84	85	301								Bianca	Is that so?	1																					
85	85		204							1	1																							
86	86		301								Bianca	Well then, if you insist...	1																					
87	87		301									Clearing her throat, Bianca picks up the story from where she left off.																						
88	88		204							1																								
89	89		301								Bianca	When I was still a nun...	1																					
90	90		301								Bianca	The church that raised me would always run short on supplies when winter came.	1																					
91	91		301								Bianca	We received supplies from the towns nearby because our church was a welfare facility built by local government organizations.	1																					
92	92		301								Bianca	Except our church was just way too far from everything else. It was all the way up the mountain, and people would always refuse to deliver supplies to us when there was a snowstorm.	1																					
93	93		301								Bianca	And whenever that happened, someone from the church or I would have to go to the towns alone to bring all the supplies back one batch at a time using the church's horse wagon.	1																					
94	94		204							1	3																							
95	95		301								Bianca	The horse wagon was made of wood, and it was nothing short of a miracle that it was able to travel on snow. And trying to get the horses to behave themselves was a difficult task, too.	1																					
96	96		301									Bianca has a wry smile on her face as she recounts her past. You can only imagine how harsh it must have been for her.																						
97	97		301								Bianca	But I slowly grew used to it... and before I knew it, the snow and wind just didn't bother me anymore...	1																					
98	98		301									Snapping back, Bianca lowers her head in guilt.																						
99	99		204							1	8																							
100	100		301								Bianca	Well... I suppose my overconfidence is what got us here in the first place.	1																					
101	101		301								Bianca	And looking back now, I guess I probably shouldn't have asked for you to be put on this mission with me in the first place, Commandant...	1																					
102	102		302								But I wouldn't have been able to hear your story if you hadn't.	103	No, Bianca. You totally made the right choice.	105																				
103	103		204							1	7																							
104	104	107	301								Bianca	Is that all you really care about?	1																					
105	105		204							1	8																							
106	106		301								Bianca	...	1																					
107	107		204							1																								
108	108		302								You might have more experience acting on your own.	109																						
109	109		302								But we're a team now.	110																						
110	110		301									When one of us messes up, the other can help to right the wrong.																						
111	111		301									When one of us finds it difficult to move forward, the other can give a helping hand.																						
112	112		301									And when one of us can't see the path ahead, the other can help show a different path.																						
113	113		204							1	8																							
114	114		301								Bianca	...You're absolutely right, Commandant.	1																					
115	115		301								Bianca	I really should stop thinking about what I'd do if I were on my own.	1																					
116	116		301								Bianca	Because things are different now... than they were before.	1																					
117	117		204							1	3																							
118	118		301								Bianca	I might have had to deal with a lot of things on my own back then, but having you right here with me now...	1																					
119	119		204							1	1																							
120	120		301								Bianca	I guess I can just safely let all that go.	1																					
121	121		302								Glad you've come around, Bianca.	122																						
122	122		302								Alright, let's keep moving.	123																						
123	123		202							1					1																			
124	124		401							2	1514																							
125	125		301									It's only when you've taken your first step into the knee-deep snow that it finally dawns on you what you're up against.																						
126	126		301									The polar suit you're in shields you from the wind and snow for the most part, but the icy air still manages to make its way up your torso through the unshielded parts of your body.																						
127	127		301									Normally, a trip through such a snowstorm would be a one-way trip to hell...																						
128	128		301									Because the trip—although only a few kilometers at best—is now a few more times as taxing as it would have been.																						
129	129		301									Fortunately, however, you're not alone.																						
130	130		301									Whenever you feel like you're about to reach the end of your rope, Bianca would be right next to you to hold your hand...																						
131	131		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Her hands are not only reassuring, but also come with such determination that they seem to be able to melt the coldest of winters.

133	133		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After trekking for what seems like an eternity, you see Bianca stop in her tracks in front of you.

135	135		301							1	Bianca	We're here, Commandant.	1																					
136	136		301									Casting light with the torch that comes with your polar suit, you see what stands before you—a long-abandoned research station.																						
137	137		301								Bianca	How are you feeling? Is everything okay?	1																					
138	138		302								Doing just fine.	139	Think I'm almost at the end of my rope here...	141																				
139	139		204							1	1																							
140	140	143	301								Bianca	That's great... Please wait here. I'll quickly go and see if this building is safe.	1																					
141	141		204							1	5																							
142	142		301								Bianca	You need to rest as soon as possible... Please hang in there. I'll quickly go and see if this building is safe.	1																					
143	143		401							2	743																							
144	144		202							1					1																			
145	145		301									Bianca pushes the door open with her longsword in hand. Moments later, the door is pushed open again.																						
146	146		201							1	500533	1																						
147	147		301							1	Bianca	All clear, Commandant. I didn't pick up on the Punishing Virus or any life form here.	1																					
148	148		301								Bianca	We can stay here until the snowstorm passes.	1																					
149	149		302								Sounds like a plan.	150																						
150	150		202							1					1																			
151	151		301									Prior to the Golden Age, humans established a number of facilities for scientific exploration in Antarctica and even entertained the idea of building a city here.																						
152	152		301									But after humans left for Babylonia, most of the research stations previously built were deserted—and even with the deployment of Babylonia's expedition in the region, only a handful of the deserted research stations begin to operate again as bases.																						
153	153		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Those that remain deserted have since become reminders of a period of time when humans still admired the spirit of discovery and were audacious enough to want to conquer Antarctica—and temporary shelters for those coming here down the road.

161	161		301									With the electricity cut off, the lights and heaters are no longer operational. Devoid of mattresses and other household items—and made worse by the dark night and snow out there—the room comes across as eerily empty.																						
162	162		301									The building itself, however, is structurally sound as it was built in accordance with the strictest of standards back then. While whistles of wind can be heard here and there, the place overall makes for a wonderful temporary shelter nonetheless.																						
163	163		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Ready to spend the night here, you and Bianca set up the tent and beds.																						
164	164		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
165	165		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You brought the tent because it's inflatable and portable, but you only brought one single heater along to make it easier for you to travel on foot.																						
166	166		301						 			To keep both of you warm, you and Bianca nestle as closely as you can and lie down next to each other.																						
167	167		301									To keep your limbs warm, the two of you turn to face each other.																						
168	168		201							1	500533

171	171		204							1	1																							
172	172		301								Bianca	Ha...	1																					
173	173		301									She laughs softly.

175	175		204							1	3																							
176	176		301								Bianca	This sure is a first...	1																					
177	177		301								Bianca	This is not the first time I've had to spend the night outside a conservation area for a mission.	1																					
178	178		301								Bianca	But I've never had to do this... with someone else.	1																					
179	179		301								Bianca	I'm actually feeling something funny on the inside.	1																					
180	180		302								It takes some getting used to.	181

190	190		301								Bianca	Your. Hand. Please. Commandant.	1																					
191	191		301									Bianca says with a big smile on her face, but her tone seems to suggest that she'll not take no for an answer.																						
192	192		301									Deep down, however, you know that she's genuinely worried about you.																						
193	193		302								Fine...

202	202		301									And with it, you quickly grow sleepy. All that traveling did seem to take a toll on you.																						
203	203		301									With the snowstorm still raging on, you feel chills down your spine every now and then.																						
204	204		301									Surprisingly, however, you fall asleep a lot faster than you do back at Babylonia.																						
205	205		301									Then, right when you're on the verge of entering dreamland...																						
206	206		301									You feel something touching you that's not Bianca's hand...																						
207	207		301									Something that passes through the gaps in between your fingers and holds your hand tightly.																						
208	208		301									It feels cold and hard...																						
209	209		301									Yet through that icy shell, you just feel its warmth...																						
210	210		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					The warmth you can't help but want to hold on to.
