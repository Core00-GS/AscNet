6	6		301								???	Of course. Everybody's been talking about it lately, because she was asking everywhere. It's been so many years, who would have thought that someone would still want to look for the Big Fish?	2

30	30		202							1					1																			
31	31		301									Steeped in the scent of jasmine tea, the town welcomes a young guest early in the morning.																						
32	32		301									Pulao sees the waiters, wearing undershirts and draped with towels, walk out of the stuffy tea room to the mouth of the alley for a bowl of fermented bean milk.																						
33	33		301									The sound of rattle drums reverberates throughout the alley. The refurbished bricks and stones could not contain the intoxicating aroma of the wine behind them.																						
34	34		301									Pulao follows the waiters out of the alley and is immediately lost in countless breakfast stalls.																						
35	35		301									She gulps and goes up to ask an old man who is shaking the rattle drum and selling sour prune drink.																						
36	36		201							1	500445	1																						
37	37		301							1	Pulao	Excuse me, can I have a bowl of sour prune drink please?	1																					
38	38		301									The old man lifts his eyes and makes a bowl of sour prune drink for Pulao, sizing her up.

41	41		301							1	Old Man	You look familiar. Have we met before?	2																					
42	42		301								Pulao	Huh? You must have mistaken me for someone else. It's my first time here. Do you know where the dock is?	1																					
43	43		301								Old Man	Fine. The dock is on D-4th Street. You're on G-6th Street, keep walking north until you go past the overhead bridge. Turn left when you see the largest Dragon Child pillar, then walk till the end.	2																					
44	44		301								Pulao	Alright. Thank you, sir.	1																					
45	45		301									Pulao takes the prune drink and sips at it.																						
46	46		301								Old Man	No worries. You're a kid with good manners. Way better than that smooth-talking guy.	2																					
47	47		204							1																								
48	48		301								Pulao	?	1																					
49	49		301								Old Man	Forget about it.	2																					
50	50		301									The old man starts to shake his rattle drum again, looking away toward the north.																						
51	51		301								Old Man	What do you think about this place? Not bad, isn't it?	2																					
52	52		204							1	1																							
53	53		301								Pulao	Right, it feels very lively.	1																					
54	54		301								Old Man	Almost too lively.	2																					
55	55		204							1																								
56	56		301								Pulao	Hmm?	1																					
57	57		301								Old Man	Do you know why there are breakfast stalls on both sides of the alley?	2																					
58	58		301									The old man suddenly changes the topic. He looks back at his own stall, asking Pulao with a smile.																						
59	59		301								Pulao	Not really. Why?	1																					
60	60		301								Old Man	Back in the old days, all the stalls were together and people always fought for trivial matters. Some argued that "tofu pudding must be salty," others claimed "nobody wanted salty tofu pudding." The conflicts never ended.	2																					
61	61		301								Old Man	To reduce the conflicts, the stalls were separated based on their flavors.	2																					
62	62		204							1	1																							
63	63		301								Pulao	I see.	1																					
64	64		301								Old Man	Yeah. People living in this busy city all have their own stresses. A little conflict is enough to detonate them.	2																					
65	65		301								Old Man	Even if the problem that causes the conflict is so trivial.	2																					
66	66		301								Old Man	I have said a lot. It's been a while since someone was willing to listen to my nagging. These Grubs are for you.	2																					
67	67		301								Old Man	Get yourself some watermelon when you arrive at the overhead bridge. That's the best thing on a summer day like this.	2																					
68	68		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Old Man	You can't say you have visited this town without trying the watermelon.	2

75	75		301								???	Except the auntie selling watermelon.	2																					
76	76		301								??	Hmm...	1																					
77	77		301								??	She has heart problems. We shouldn't get her involved.	1																					
78	78		301								??	Move out when the girl is off the overhead bridge.	1

86	86		202							1					1																			
87	87		301									After bidding farewell to the old man, Pulao headed toward the dock. Just like he said, she saw an old woman selling watermelon on the overhead bridge.																						
88	88		301									She just wanted a few slices for a taste, but when the old woman saw her Grubs, she gave Pulao two baskets without hesitation. Pulao had to put "It's-a-sword" on her back and carry one basket on each hand on her way to the dock.																						
89	89		201							1	500445	1																						
90	90		301							1	Pulao	She seemed very nostalgic when she looked at the signs on the Grubs.	1																					
91	91		301								Pulao	They must have had some stories... Oops.	1

103	103		301								Pulao	Must be in a hurry.	1																					
104	104		301									Pulao grabs the watermelon baskets but realizes her back has become a lot lighter.																						
105	105		301								Pulao	Huh? Why does that sword on his back look so familiar?	1																					
106	106		204							1	5
