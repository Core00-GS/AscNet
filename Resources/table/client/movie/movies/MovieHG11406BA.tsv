4	4		301							1	Rosetta	All of the surveying instruments are up and operational—	1																					
5	5		301								Rosetta	Campfire ready, tent is up, and we got fish from the bear... Good, all ready.	1																					
6	6		301								Rosetta	Commandant, we just need to keep watch here until morning.	1

8	8		301									Rosetta tells you so as she adds firewood to the campfire. The branches dried beforehand immediately catch fire as they join the pile.																						
9	9		301									The campfire flares up, burning and blooming like a blossom. The embers dance sporadically in the air, become taken by the Arctic wind, then fall and go out on the snow.																						
10	10		201							1	500214																							
11	11		301							1	Rosetta	Commandant, thank you so much for coming with me on this mission.	1																					
12	12		302								This feels more like a vacation than a mission.	13	I did promise you after all.	14																				
13	13	15	301								Rosetta	The engineers also said that this is kind of a vacation. Most of them were just reluctant to leave the engineering bay.	1																					
14	14		301								Rosetta	I see... Thank you, Commandant.	1																					
15	15		202							1																								
16	16		301									After that, Rosetta falls quiet, occasionally adding in firewood and glancing at the surveying instrument.																						
17	17		301									The engineers specified that, since this is the last survey, they will not dispatch another crew to recover the instruments.																						
18	18		301									So Rosetta will need to wait here for all instruments to obtain enough data, then pack everything up and bring it back to Babylonia.																						
19	19		201							1	500214																							
20	20		301							1	Rosetta	Commandant, you can go rest in the tent if you're tired. I'll be on night watch.	1																					
21	21		302								I'm not tired yet.	22	I feel bad leaving it all to you...	23																				
22	22	24	301								Rosetta	Really...? I think you should still rest while you can, though. After all, who knows what could happen?	1																					
23	23		301								Rosetta	It's okay. This is my duty, after all. Not to mention, Constructs are more suitable for this kind of work.	1

28	28		301								Rosetta	Huh?!	1																					
29	29		301									Rosetta is about to badger you into sleeping again, but a sudden tremor causes her to pause.																						
30	30		301								Rosetta	It's... raining?	1																					
31	31		302								This is the first time I've seen it rain here.	32	Do you have an umbrella?	33																				
32	32	34	301								Rosetta	No, not just that... Coupled with the tremors—Commandant, I recommend that we hurry up and take shelter.	1																					
33	33		301								Rosetta	We might have a situation, Commandant. We need to find shelter ASAP.	1																					
34	34		301									Seeing the rain, Rosetta immediately wields her weapon. Her eyes meet your befuddled ones.																						
35	35		301								Rosetta	Commandant, remember what the bear said about working at the climate station?	1																					
36	36		302								Yes.	37	Did he cause those tremors?	38																				
37	37	39	301								Rosetta	I don't have any evidence, but based on the change in weather, there may be something wrong with the climate station.	1																					
38	38		301								Rosetta	No, I don't think so. But it looks like there's a problem with the climate station.	1																					
39	39		301								Rosetta	Earthquakes, rain... Who knows what might come next. I'm worried that the tent won't keep us safe out here in the snowfield.	1																					
40	40		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Rosetta	Anyway, come with me, quick. There should be a Forest Guard shelter up ahead.	1

43	43		301							1	Rosetta	We should be safe here.	1																					
44	44		301									You and Rosetta find shelter in a cave. The entrance of the cave howls as ice and snow whirl in the frigid wind.																						
45	45		301								Rosetta	I knew it... Looks like we'll be stuck here for a few hours as we wait out the blizzard.	1																					
46	46		302								Not my lucky day, huh...	47																						
47	47		301								Rosetta	Huh?	1																					
48	48		301									Hearing you utter her catchphrase, Rosetta pauses before breaking into a chuckle.																						
49	49		204							1	1																							
50	50		301								Rosetta	Never thought you'd have this playful side to you... But it really is unfortunate to have this happen on the last day. We'll likely have to recalibrate the equipment.	1																					
51	51		301								Rosetta	But on the whole, I guess I'm pretty lucky.	1																					
52	52		301									Without giving you a chance to react, Rosetta leans over.																						
53	53		301								Rosetta	Through all this misfortune, I got to see the world for my own and come to my own conclusions.	1																					
54	54		301								Rosetta	And now, I'm sitting in the same place as you, 【kuroname】.	1																					
55	55		301								Rosetta	I'm not very good at expressing myself, but I can tell that you're trying to get to know me.	1																					
56	56		301								Rosetta	...Which is why I asked you to come to the Arctic with me, so I can show you how I live in the wild. I wanted to tell you all that you want to know about me.	1																					
57	57		301								Rosetta	So, 【kuroname】... Do you know me a bit better now?	1																					
58	58		302								Yeah.	59	Not enough.	60																				
59	59	61	301								Rosetta	That's great. I'm not too good at introducing myself to others, after all.	1																					
60	60		301								Rosetta	Then let's take it slow in the future. We still have many more fights ahead of us. We have the time.	1																					
61	61		301								Rosetta	Speaking of, I've been telling you everything that's on my mind... Since the mission will have to be suspended in this weather anyway...	1																					
62	62		301								Rosetta	Think you could tell me more about yourself, 【kuroname】? I feel like the Babylonia records don't paint the whole picture.	1																					
63	63		302								I don't know where to begin...	64	This will take some time.	65																				
64	64	66	301								Rosetta	Anything works—your hobbies, your past, or whatever is on your mind... Anything.	1																					
65	65		301								Rosetta	I don't mind...	1																					
66	66		301								Rosetta	Before this snowstorm stops—	1																					
67	67		201							1	500208																							
68	68		301							1	Bionic Bear	Uh, sorry folks, but uh... I'm taking shelter here, too, aye?	1
