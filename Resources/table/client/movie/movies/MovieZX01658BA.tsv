8	8		301									The ashen creature's blade slits across Lucia's flank, forcing her to dash back with her jetpack, putting some distance between them.																						
9	9		301									The Punishing Virus it carries instantly infests her wound, causing her severe pain—but her fight has yet to end.																						
10	10		201							1	500166	5																						
11	11		301							1	Lucia	This... is nothing.	1																					
12	12		202							1					1																			
13	13		301									Her blade-wielding figure is as awe-inspiring and determined as you first met her. Lucia quickly treats her injury before pointing her blade at the Hetero-Creature again.																						
14	14		301									The ashen creature is adapting to Lucia's attacks as if it is learning while fighting.																						
15	15		301									But Lucia does not hesitate. She manages to distance herself again during an opening of the Hetero-Creature's attacks.																						
16	16		301									Before it can recalibrate its stance, Lucia is already closing in with her sword out.

25	25		202							1					1

36	36		301									Your shots hit an arm as it nears Lucia, splintering it, and the Red Tide pours from the wound and wriggles on the platform like worms.																						
37	37		301			RImgBg1Shake						Having lost an "organ," the Polyphage cries so deafeningly that the scream thumps on your eardrums and causes you searing pain.																						
38	38		301									Meanwhile, the ashen Hetero-Creature has regained consciousness, stretching its wings and approaching the platform.																						
39	39		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiSHanshuoNew.prefab																							
40	40		302								It's drawing power from Luna!	41																						
41	41		401							2	10007001																							
42	42		301									The ashen creature swings its scythe toward Lucia, and she blocks it with her katana.																						
43	43		201							1	500166	5																						
44	44		301							1	Lucia	If that's the case—	1																					
45	45		301									Deflecting the Hetero-Creature's blows, Lucia finds an opportunity to throw you a rectangular case.																						
46	46		301								Lucia	Commandant! Catch!	1																					
47	47		202							1					1																			
48	48		302								(Catch)	49																						
49	49		301									It is a weapon cache Lucia put away when you were gathering resources. You activate it, and a familiar-looking katana ejects from within.																						
50	50		301									The blade you are holding is an ebony katana that is pure black save for its edge, glistening in orange. The tiny scratches and scars on it reveal a storied history of battles.																						
51	51		302								This is...	52																						
52	52		201							1	500166	5																						
53	53		301							1	Lucia	I'm counting on you, Commandant!	1																					
54	54		301									Lucia looks over you to the Energy Core that is imprisoning Luna, then clutches her katana and clips another impending hunting claw.																						
55	55		202							1					1																			
56	56		401							2	1513																							
57	57		301									You immediately understand what Lucia means. You close your palm around the grip of the ebony blade, rushing toward the Polyphage's Core.																						
58	58		301									You cut through the hunting claws blocking your way, while Lucia eliminates the ones reaching from behind you, all the while fighting the ashen Hetero-Creature.																						
59	59		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiSHanshuoNew.prefab	2																							
60	60		301									Your chest aches from the continuous running, but now is not the time to stop.																						
61	61		302								(Plunge the katana into the Polyphage's Core)	62																						
62	62		401							2	10002001																							
63	63		301									Lucia's yearning coats the katana in your hand, sharpening its edge and strengthening its blade, and you slide it deep into the Energy Core. Deep crimson light immediately radiates where you cut it open.																						
64	64		301								Polyphage	—!!!																						
65	65		301			RImgBg1Shake						The Polyphage releases an earsplitting roar. Multiple hunting claws take shape on its head, all lunging toward you.																						
66	66		301									And then—the arms are all cut down by a chilling frost blade, scattering all over the floor.																						
67	67		301									You drive your katana deeper, and the crimson glow slowly shrouds everything.																						
68	68		302								Almost...	69																						
69	69		301									The ashen Hetero-Creature has fully recovered. It gathers as much Punishing Virus as it can from the surroundings and shoots out a scarlet beam of virus toward you.																						
70	70		301									Lucia sinks her blade into the ground as an anchor and shields you with her jetpack. The Punishing Virus slowly disintegrates the surface of the engine, and the force is pushing Lucia back.																						
71	71		302								Lucia, get out of here!	72	This is too dangerous!	72																				
72	72		201							1	500166	5																						
73	73		301							1	Lucia	No! If I back away now, you'll...!	1																					
74	74		301								Lucia	The only way to keep everyone safe is to stop it here! I will not back down!	1																					
75	75		301									As her jetpack completely dissolves, Lucia draws her katana from the ground, ready to block the deadly ray with her blade.																						
76	76		302								Lucia, wait! You're going to be—	77																						
77	77		201							1	500248																							
78	78		301							1	Ashen Hetero-Creature	—?	1																					
79	79		202							1					1																			
80	80		301									The beam suddenly stops. The ashen Hetero-Creature falls to the ground as if it suddenly loses power.																						
81	81		201							1	500166																							
82	82		301							1	Lucia	What... happened?	1																					
83	83		202							1					1																			
84	84		301									The Hetero-Creature on the ground writhes and trashes, making a horrifying, twisted shriek.																						
85	85		301									Following the creature's frenzy movement, the Polyphage also slows down, and the hunting claws all stop in mid-air, frozen, as if they have stopped receiving any directive.																						
86	86		301									This anomaly lasts only half a second before the Hetero-Creature flaps its wings again, trying to reposition itself.																						
87	87		201							1	500166																							
88	88		301							1	Lucia	Commandant! Now!	1

93	93		301									Ignoring the crazed alarm from your Punishing Virus detector, you push with your last bit of strength, and your katana finally punctures the shielding of the Polyphage's Core. With a flash of crimson, the Core begins to crack.																						
94	94		301									No one knows what would happen if a human hand reaches inside a Core, but there is only one thing you can do now...																						
95	95		302								Luna!	96																						
96	96		201							1	500238	3																						
97	97		301							1	Luna	...	1																					
98	98		302								Wake up!	99																						
99	99		301									The interior of the Core spews out countless hunting claws, and they hold on to Luna as stubbornly as the Polyphage's obsession is.																						
100	100		301									Those slender arms attack everything that approaches, desperate to tear into everything they touch and drag them inside.																						
101	101		301									The protective suit from the Support Force you are wearing is torn away by their relentless talons. The Corruption Index shown on your wrist is climbing rapidly.																						
102	102		302								Ugh... I feel...	103																						
103	103		301									You no longer feel your body aching. In fact, you no longer feel your arms and legs—you do not need the maddening alarms to know that your body has reached its limit.																						
104	104		301									Madness, hatred, the desire to destroy... The corruption on the mind from the Polyphage seeps into you alongside the Punishing Virus. Yet, so does the yearning from Luna.																						
105	105		301								Luna	...	1																					
106	106		301									You fall into a constant clash with Luna's mind, and her pain, anger, and obsession all plunge into the gaps of your consciousness like a torrent of melted snow.																						
107	107		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You can feel her consciousness entwining yours, and as your psyches interweaved, into the chaotic M.I.N.D. you fall.

114	114		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Complete darkness lies before you. You cannot tell if the space you are in is narrow or vast, and time stops having any meaning here, as it stretches a moment to eternity.																						
115	115		301									You immediately notice a white figure in the void because, in this immense darkness, she is the only light.																						
116	116		301								???	How did you get here?																						
117	117		301									Although you have only heard her voice a few times, you instantly recognize this is Luna speaking.																						
118	118		302								Luna...?	119																						
119	119		301									The young girl in white curls up into a ball on the floor—if the darkness you are stepping on is indeed the ground.																						
120	120		201							1	500238	4																						
121	121		301							1	Luna	Who're you?	1																					
122	122		302								Don't you know me?	123	I'm the Gray Raven Commandant.	125																				
123	123		301								Luna	...	1																					
124	124	126	301								Luna	So, it's Lucia's commandant this time...	1																					
125	125		301								Luna	So, it's Lucia's commandant this time...	1																					
126	126		301									She walks toward you—not hovering, for some reason, and the eyes on her shorter frame look up at you.																						
127	127		301								Luna	Whatever you want to say, I get it.	1																					
128	128		302								...?	129	What do you mean?	129																				
129	129		301								Luna	I know the routine now. If I don't listen to you, my body hurts.	1																					
130	130		301								Luna	All I've wanted is for my wish to come true. All I've wanted... is Lucia by my side.	1																					
131	131		301								Luna	She no longer has to act tough or lie about the bad things in the world. I'm strong enough for both of us now. I'll carry her burden, whatever it is. She just needs to stay with me.	1																					
132	132		301								Luna	I'll destroy this world of liars, and I'll make all the vile men pay.	1																					
133	133		301								Luna	Once the filtering is over, I'll create a paradise where we can live freely. A place to truly call home.	1																					
134	134		301								Luna	And then everything that's ever hurt and upset Lucia will disappear. She and I can go to the places she's always wanted to go.	1																					
135	135		301								Luna	She... is still the kind soul she was, but something's changed, and she wouldn't tell me what it is.	1																					
136	136		301								Luna	But the only thing that I've never regretted is finding her and getting her back to me.	1																					
137	137		301									Luna's gaze seems to go through you, setting on something else. Chillingly she smirks.																						
138	138		204							1	2																							
139	139		301								Luna	Doesn't matter whose face you're donning. I know none of this is real.	1

143	143		401							2	1503																							
144	144		301									The void begins to shake. The corners of Luna's clothes begin to crumble and fade into the darkness. You fear that her consciousness will soon follow suit.																						
145	145		302								I'm not a projection.	146																						
146	146		201							1	500238	4

150	150		301									Luna's expression changes back to the one you remember—proud, estranged, but then fictitious and distant.																						
151	151		302								Lucia is still fighting.	152																						
152	152		301									Even in the M.I.N.D., the sound of Lucia battling the Hetero-Creature comes through constantly. Every wound she takes is another second to save Luna.

158	158		204							1	4																							
159	159		301									As though something has hit her, Luna braces her head with her hands.																						
160	160		301								Luna	What's... happening to me?	1																					
161	161		301								Luna	I was there with... Gabriel, and the Polyphage... that thing... it's wrong, it shouldn't exist...	1																					
162	162		301								Luna	And then I...	1																					
163	163		302								You're inside the Polyphage.	164	Gabriel's going after Alpha.	164																				
164	164		301									Luna's expression shifts for the first time. She stands straight and tall.

172	172		202							1					1																			
173	173		301									The voice of Alpha's call lingers in the air while the sound of Lucia's battle hits your consciousness periodically, guiding you like a beacon.																						
174	174		301									The darkness tries to flood you out, rejecting your invasive psyche. You keep getting ejected from the M.I.N.D., bouncing between it and reality.																						
175	175		301									As the force that pulls you away intensifies, more and more voices from the outside world leak into the M.I.N.D, destabilizing your hold of it. But you still try your best to tell Luna your plan.																						
176	176		301									Witnessing your fading shadow, Luna looks conflicted.																						
177	177		301									"I will take every chance to overcome this."																						
178	178		301									"That's why I'm going to get you out of here."																						
179	179		301									"And you're going to defeat the Polyphage and save Lucia."																						
180	180		201							1	500238	4																						
181	181		301							1	Luna	Is that why you believe in this human, Lucia?	1																					
182	182		301								Luna	Even without my full power, I should be able to accomplish that.	1

184	184		202							1					1																			
185	185		301									Realizing that Luna is attempting to escape, the dense fog of darkness converges around her again, striking her with its physical form.																						
186	186		301									The nightmare that has been haunting her M.I.N.D. is now a physical monster that rips into her body, and it tries to drag her back into the abyss.

198	198		301									However, the infection from the Punishing Virus is surprisingly receding even without injecting a serum, despite the fact that you should have succumbed to it long ago.																						
199	199		301									The chaos that was flooding into your mind has also stopped as if something is blocking it. Your incapacitated body is now slowly recovering.

203	203		301									The Polyphage reacts to Luna waking up by expending all its power to suppress her mind. She winces again from the pain.																						
204	204		301									It attempts to pull her consciousness back into the abyss once more. If it succeeds, their minds will be fused forever, and Luna will cease to exist while the Polyphage will gain all her power.																						
205	205		301									But this has distracted the Polyphage long enough from maintaining control over the hunting claws. The aggressive arms begin to weaken, making them easy targets even for a novice sword-wielder.
