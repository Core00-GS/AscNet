6	5		301								Lucia	Do your people have a weather system of your own?	2																					
7	6		301								Watanabe	Since your grand retreat, even Babylonia has not succeeded in deploying a single satellite. Do you think we could have one ourselves?	1																					
8	7		301								Lucia	Then—	2

10	9		301								Watanabe	Live here long enough and you can tell the patterns.	1																					
11	10		301								Watanabe	Alright, let's bid our farewells here. Next time we meet, we'll be enemies.	1																					
12	11		301								Lucia	Um, Watanabe?	2																					
13	12		301								Watanabe	?	1																					
14	13		301								Lucia	From your personal judgment, could you share with us a nearby location suitable for resupply or a safe retreat?	2																					
15	14		301								Watanabe	...	1																					
16	15		301								Watanabe	There are no safe spots nearby.	1																					
17	16		301								Lucia	If that's the case, thank you anyway...	2																					
18	17		301								Watanabe	But we do have a temporary surveying point somewhere near, of course, only if you're willing to come.	1																					
19	18		301								Lucia	But your people would not welcome our visit.	2																					
20	19		301								Watanabe	Indeed. We'd only welcome Babylonian transport crafts with anti-air missiles.	1

25	24		301								Lee	Commandant's supplies are running low. We have no more options, and—	1																					
26	25		301								Lee	We have good odds.	1																					
27	26		301								Lucia	You mean...	2																					
28	27		301								Lee	First, Watanabe is in our hands. Second, if we manage to get this info up to Babylonia, we'll get firepower support.	1																					
29	28		301								Lee	Enough to balance out a threat.	1
