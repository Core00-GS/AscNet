6	551		301			DialogEnable				1	Lee	I hacked into a mechanoid's memory shell, but the data I got so far only reveals the authority hierarchy on the ship.	3																					
7	552		301								Lee	It's based on biometric verification. Organism, or in this case humans, have the lowest authority on the ship, followed by mechanoids, then Constructs. The highest authority belongs to the main control system.	3																					
8	553		301									A sad look creeps onto Liv's face, as if she is reminded of something unpleasant.																						
9	554		301								Lee	The "Pulao crew" that the merchant are a group of people serving under someone called Pulao. Pulao is a member of the Kowloong Crew, the other members include Qiuniu, Yazi, Chaofeng, Suanni, Baxia, Bian, Fuxi, and Chiwen.	3																					
10	555	6	301								Lee	These are the code names of the Kowloong Crew Constructs on the ship. They have mid-level authority.	3																					
11	6		301							1	Lee	...I should also mention that these mechanoids have virtual M.I.N.D.s and they function normally.	3																					
12	7		302								Virtual M.I.N.D.s?	8	Function normally?	10																				
13	8		301								Lee	They can engage in rudimentary thinking and thought simulation. Compared with Construct M.I.N.D.s, mechanoid M.I.N.D.s simulate reality more precisely. They should also be capable of consciousness recall.	3																					
14	9	11	301								Lee	Well, "consciousness"... as in recalling their info storage and holographic data.	3																					
15	10		301								Lee	They can think on a rudimentary level and simulate thought. They're also capable of consciousness recall.	3																					
16	11		301								Lee	This is part of the reason why you were able to link with and manipulate them...	3																					
17	12		301								Lee	Meanwhile, I checked the control terminals in this place too... They're rather advanced.	3

19	13		301								Liv	Yes... I tried hacking into them but didn't find a single vulnerability...	2																					
20	112		204							2																								
21	14		301								Lee	Consistent, rigorous, and well-crafted. All the mechanoids and equipment adopt the same operating system.	3																					
22	15		301								Lee	...Quite like a beehive.	3																					
23	16		302								That means we might have already been exposed.	17	If the mechanoids can recall their data...	17																				
24	17		301								Lucia	...!	1																					
25	18		301								Lucia	...It's likely, Commandant. Our coordinates, our headcount, and even video data of us in combat... have already fallen into someone else's hands.	1																					
26	19		301								Lee	So who is this "someone" anyway...?	3																					
27	20		302								We might have been led to this storage on purpose.	21	It's a trap!	21																				
28	21		401							2	1509																							
29	22		301								Liv	The radar is picking up more mechanoids... and biological signals tooâ€”from a Construct.	2																					
30	23		301								Lee	The Kowloong Crew?	3																					
31	24		301								Lee	There's this old oriental saying in the database that goes, "Speak of Cao Cao and he doth appear."	3																					
32	25		302								Stay calm.	26	We'll play along.	26
