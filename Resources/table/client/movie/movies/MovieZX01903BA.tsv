20	20		301									Despite the Red Tide having been cleansed for quite some time already, it shows signs of surfacing once more. After a concerted effort to find Luna, the enemy leader, her whereabouts remain unknown.																						
21	21		301									Whatever the reason, it's the sign of a colossal threat to come.																						
22	22		301									But for Chrome, this recon mission has deeper implications after learning about the current state of 【kuroname】.

27	27		301									Looking at the ground in front of him, Chrome opens the map on his terminal and tries to figure out their current position.																						
28	28		301								Chrome	Based on the previous investigation, let's head northwest first. That's where a majority of the data anomalies that we have been monitoring are located.	1

48	48		301									Several days had already passed since they were tasked with deploying the bit domain nodes, but you are still being "monitored."																						
49	49		301									He has wanted to investigate the commandant's previously unmentioned symptoms on his own in search of treatment, but he has only been met with red tape.																						
50	50		301								Wanshi	(Looks like this mission is just an excuse to keep Strike Hawk out of the picture...)	1																					
51	51		301									A sneaking suspicion pops up in his M.I.N.D., but he lacks the proper intel to back it up.																						
52	52		301								Wanshi	(Let's finish the mission before investigating any further.)	1

60	60		301								Chrome	Correct, Mr. President.	2																					
61	61		301								Hassen	We ran another threat assessment of the mission. You may encounter a mass of Red Tide, so I've temporarily assigned Camu to join the team.	1																					
62	62		301								Hassen	Due to his particular nature as a Transcendant, let him operate alone as much as possible. But DON'T let him remove the filter Asimov made for him.	1																					
63	63		301								Chrome	Roger.	2																					
64	64		301								Hassen	He'll be there shortly. I'll leave the rest to you, Captain.	1

70	70		301							1	Kamui	Did the President just raise the threat level of the mission?	2																					
71	71		301								Chrome	No, he is just taking into consideration the potential risks by assigning Camu to our team.	1																					
72	72		202							1	2				1																			
73	73		301									But if the situation is really as simple as Hassen made it out to be, all they would have to do is check if any area had slipped between the cracks.																						
74	74		301									But are those areas the reason for the increased threat level?

79	79		301								Kamui	This place has been picked cleaner than a tub of ice cream in Camu's hand. There's no Red Tide in sight.	2																					
80	80		301								Camu	What was that?																						
81	81		202							1	2				1

105	105		301							1	Chrome	The terrain here is too difficult to differentiate, Camu. We can split up after we reach our target.	1

109	109		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The barren land extends outward like a vast ocean. Under the timeworn and sallow sky, the distant horizon is obscured by smoke and dust, like the scorched edges of burnt paper.																						
110	110		301									Camu silently follows the trio from a distance, scanning the area for clues.

118	118		301								Wanshi	I can't imagine why someone would be in such a dreadful place.	3

131	131		301								Chrome	...We can't tell if it's the same person yet.	1																					
132	132		301								Chrome	Must be a Corrupted or Ascendant nearby given the Punishing concentration of their footsteps.	1																					
133	133		301									Following Camu's gaze, Chrome looks back at the transport craft.																						
134	134		301								Wanshi	Why would they be hiding if they're an Ascendant?	3																					
135	135		301								Kamui	To draw our attention?	2																					
136	136		301								Chrome	Or maybe they're wounded and trying to avoid a confrontation.	1																					
137	137		301									Considering that these footsteps might belong to their target, Chrome determines to continue pursuit.																						
138	138		301								Chrome	We can't jump to conclusions. Let's keep searching.	1
