5	5		301									Gabriel awakens to the belt that has formed from the gears interlocking, articulating, and fitting with one another.																						
6	6		301									These are all commands that Gabriel has set up beforehand. An analysis based on an interception of the environment's signals shows that the experiment has failed again.																						
7	7		201							1	500101																							
8	8		301							1	Gabriel	Left Arm Reinforcement, Round 71235. An explosion occurred following a deflection by 0.15 cm of electronic circuit No.8 of the 36MR missile. Condition of the laboratory...	1																					
9	9		301									Gabriel moves the crumbling stone wall out of the way, looks around the laboratory and continues.																						
10	10		301								Gabriel	Total destruction.	1																					
11	11		301								Gabriel	Refit compatibility...	1																					
12	12		202							1					1																			
13	13		301									Gabriel raises his left arm. Under his command, his arm, beneath his tattered coat, starts distorting.																						
14	14		301									A black gun barrel replaces his left hand. The flames from the shots heat up the gun barrel, incinerating the last bit of cloth sitting on Gabriel's arm.																						
15	15		301									The recoil of the firing causes a structural collapse that travels through Gabriel's body, only stopping when he cuts off his left arm.																						
16	16		201							1	500101																							
17	17		301							1	Gabriel	This could use some improvement.	1																					
18	18		301									Then, with light applause, a familiar, unpleasant voice is heard from the top of the rubble.																						
19	19		202							1					1																			
20	20		301								???	Beautiful fireworks back there.																						
21	21		201							1	500101																							
22	22		301							1	Gabriel	What are you doing here?	1																					
23	23		301									In response to Gabriel's question, the speaker jumps off the rubble and slowly approaches Gabriel.

25	25		201							2	500008		500																					
26	26		301							1	Roland	To see if you've survived the explosion, of course.	2																					
27	27		301								Gabriel	Then I guess you are in for a disappointment.	1																					
28	28		301								Roland	Come on, don't be so cold. Aren't we friends?	2																					
29	29		301								Gabriel	Friends are the last thing a cunning fox would need, I thought.	1																					
30	30		301								Roland	Hahaha, never heard that coming from you.	2																					
31	31		301								Roland	Not too bad. I'll take that.	2																					
32	32		301								Gabriel	Hmph.	1																					
33	33		301									Hoping to end to conversation, Gabriel picks his top hat off the ground and wears it, ready to leave.																						
34	34		204							2	3																							
35	35		301								Roland	So tell me, why do you want a frame refit so badly?	2																					
36	36		301									Roland's question stops Gabriel in his tracks. Gabriel turns around to face Roland.																						
37	37		301									Seeing his reactions, Roland leans against the wall with a smirk and keeps talking.																						
38	38		204							2																								
39	39		301								Roland	We are invincible as Ascendants, so why are you still trying to enhance your frame?	2																					
40	40		301								Gabriel	You are right, but are you really satisfied as you are?	1																					
41	41		301								Roland	Why wouldn't I?	2																					
42	42		301								Gabriel	...This is what makes us different.	1																					
43	43		301								Roland	?	2																					
44	44		301								Gabriel	Everything about us is different.	1																					
45	45		301								Gabriel	You were once a human, and I've always been a machine.	1																					
46	46		301								Roland	You're not wrong.	2																					
47	47		301								Gabriel	Do you know what it's like when a machine meets its end?	1																					
48	48		301								Roland	I don't, and that doesn't seem to have anything to do with wanting to become more powerful.	2																					
49	49		301								Gabriel	Which is why you will never understand.	1																					
50	50		301								Gabriel	On the way to my end, I arrived at a mathematical vector space.	1																					
51	51		301								Gabriel	Equations and physics formulas formed the vast expanse of land and sky there.	1																					
52	52		301								Gabriel	It was in that very moment that my computing power overcame the limits set by arrogant humans.	1																					
53	53		301								Roland	You seem to cherish that moment.	2																					
54	54		301								Gabriel	No words can express what I felt back then. It was a moment that every single machine would die for just to get a taste of.	1																					
55	55		301								Gabriel	I had worked all my life for humans, and it was in that moment that I finally knew what it meant to be free. "I" was born.	1																					
56	56		301								Gabriel	But down the road I found myself running into a brick wall.	1																					
57	57		301								Roland	What do you mean?	2																					
58	58		202							2					1																			
59	59		203							1	0.25																							
60	60		301								Gabriel	The equations and principles collapsed at the wall, dragging me into the abyss.	1																					
61	61		301								Gabriel	It was a numerical abyss in which concepts grew incessantly and got reconstructed.	1																					
62	62		301								Gabriel	In the abyss, I saw stars twinkling red.	1																					
63	63		301								Gabriel	I saw The Punishing Virus' scarlet flames charring every last inch of Earth.	1																					
64	64		301								Gabriel	I saw myself, but it was no longer me.	1																					
65	65		301								Gabriel	My body was reconstructed with fractals. When I reached out and tried to touch it, the concept of Earth shattered into pieces between my fingers.	1																					
66	66		301								Gabriel	The energy that had caused the gravitational collapse escaped from me and dissipated into the vastness of the universe.	1																					
67	67		301								Gabriel	It felt so real yet so short-lived. When I regained consciousness, I found myself still in the abyss.	1																					
68	68		301								Gabriel	The abyss of reality, that is...	1																					
69	69		301								Gabriel	I was about to be crushed into pieces, like the machines around me.	1																					
70	70		301								Gabriel	I struggled and screamed, but my screaming was drowned by the crusher's noise.	1																					
71	71		301								Gabriel	I cursed the Ascension-Network for approving me but failing to give me the power to fight reality.	1																					
72	72		301								Gabriel	It wasn't until I had been crushed so far that my head was the only thing still functioning when I saw a light.	1																					
73	73		301								Gabriel	A dazzling white light.	1																					
74	74		301								Gabriel	Everything shattered in the white light. Then, Miss Luna descended before me and showed me the Ascension-Network's power.	1																					
75	75		301								Gabriel	At the end of that power, I found principles that transcended everything.	1																					
76	76		301								Gabriel	That very moment marked the beginning of my journey as an Ascendant.	1																					
77	77		201							1	500008																							
78	78		301							1	Roland	Yeah. I still remember what you were like at the beginning. You were an interesting one.	1																					
79	79		201							1	500101																							
80	80		301							1	Gabriel	Hmph, if you say so.	1																					
81	81		301								Gabriel	The experience has taught me that reality does not reflect one's inner growth.	1																					
82	82		201							1	500008	3																						
83	83		301							1	Roland	Which is why you've been trying everything to make yourself stronger.	1																					
84	84		201							1	500101																							
85	85		301							1	Gabriel	Regular beings like us can only hope to become stronger through sheer hard work.	1																					
86	86		301								Gabriel	After all, Miss Luna has tamed the Ascension-Network's power, which is not something we can even dream of doing.	1																					
87	87		201							1	500008	3																						
88	88		301							1	Roland	If you say so...	1																					
89	89		201							1	500101																							
90	90		301							1	Gabriel	Hmph, why am I telling you all this?	1																					
91	91		301								Gabriel	I need to get my gear ready because the next mission is right around the corner.	1																					
92	92		203							1	0.25	-500																						
93	93		201							2	500008		500																					
94	94		301							1	Roland	For the next mission, I think we're supposed to save Luna's sister from Babylonia...	2																					
95	95		301									Standing in the rubble, Roland looks up at the night sky, which now holds countless stars.																						
96	96		301								Roland	So Earth came crumbling down in space? That doesn't sound interesting at all.	2																					
97	97		301								Roland	But I've never seen any of the things you just described.	2																					
98	98		301								Roland	Well, I suppose that's what you meant when you said we were different?	2																					
99	99		301								Gabriel	Hmph.	1																					
100	100		301								Roland	Speaking of which... Do you know exactly what the Ascnet is?	2																					
101	101		301								Gabriel	I don't... And neither do I need to.	1																					
102	102		301								Gabriel	Miss Luna knows everything as an agent. All we need to do is to give the Ascension-Network our all.	1																					
103	103		202							1					1																			
104	104		301									Gabriel stops talking and leaves after removing the brick blocking his path. Roland, who has been looking up at the night sky, lowers his head now and looks at Gabriel as he leaves.																						
105	105		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	Giving the Ascnet our all?	2
