5	5		301									Camu is standing on a crumbling building in the abandoned city. The Red Tide rumbles under his feet.																						
6	6		301								Camu	How annoying. Can't just wade across it either.	1

8	8		301									Camu stares at the skyscrapers in the distance and brainstorms ways to quickly get through the city.																						
9	9		301									The Red Tide, which has been rhythmically hitting the building, suddenly churns. Countless Hetero-Creatures form then rupture in the tide. Eventually, they become transparent eggs and hatch at a tremendous speed.																						
10	10		301									Matured Hetero-Creatures break through their sticky shells and climb toward the building, which is about to be swallowed by the Red Tide. Then they mechanically turn their heads and wander around, looking for prey.																						
11	11		301									The only "living" thing nearby is Camu, who is standing on the rooftop.																						
12	12		301									The Hetero-Creatures incubated by the Red Tide hiss sharply and charge at Camu.

15	15		301								Camu	Tsk, this is making me mad.	1																					
16	16		301									Those Ascendants are annoying enough, but these things are ten times more disturbing than Roland.																						
17	17		301								Camu	Vile.	1

24	24		301									After taking out the last Hetero-Creature, Camu's terminal rings and signals a connection.

28	27		301							1	Camu	Speak.	1																					
29	28		301									Whoever is on the other side seems to be accustomed to Camu's unfriendly attitude. The message is given in the usual gentle voice, which somehow irritates Camu.																						
30	29		301								Camu	You mean Gray Raven?	1																					
31	30		301								Camu	...Got it.	1

33	32		301									After disconnecting, Camu studies the map that was sent to him, including a few highlighted potential routes and destinations.																						
34	33		301									The closest one is deep underground, less than two kilometers from Camu's current location.
