3	3		301			DialogEnable					Commandant A	That's definitely a foul! Foul!																						
4	4		301								Commandant B	C'mon, just forget about it. Who'd care about this sort of things on the battlefield...																						
5	5		301									As soon as you enter the simulation training room, you see two commandants you have met before arguing around the holographic projection screen.																						
6	6		301									Looking around, you find the "Wanshi's Resting Place" still posted on the wall, but he is nowhere to be found. Having not seen each other since the classroom, you cannot tell if you are glad or upset to miss him here.																						
7	7		301									Just as you sigh a breath of relief and pick up the device hanging by the training cabin, a shout comes from behind.

9	9		301							1	Wanshi	Ah, Gray Raven Commandant.	1																					
10	10		302								Wanshi?	12	Are you training here as well?	11																				
11	11		301								Wanshi	Well, going over the basics.	1																					
12	12		301								Wanshi	Want to train one-on-one?	1																					
13	13		202							1					1																			
14	14		301								Commandant A	Hey, didn't you just turn me down? That's unfair!																						
15	15		301									The commandant nearby grumbles.																						
16	16		201							1	500273	1																						
17	17		301							1	Wanshi	Well, I'm just returning a favor from the Gray Raven Commandant.	1																					
18	18		301								Wanshi	Thank you for sleeping with me last time. It was nice.	1																					
19	19		302								?	20																						
20	20		202							1					1																			
21	21		301								Commandant A	?																						
22	22		301								Commandant B	?																						
23	23		302								It's not what you think.	24																						
24	24		201							1	500273																							
25	25		301							1	Wanshi	And the gifts you sent, they've been working very well...	1																					
26	26		302								Don't phrase it like that! People might misunderstand!	28																						
27	27		204							1	7																							
28	28		301								Wanshi	Huh?	1																					
29	29		301								Wanshi	I'm just stating the facts. The gifts you sent have completely filled my sleeping pod...	1																					
30	30		202							1					1																			
31	31		301								Commandant A	???																						
32	32		301								Commandant B	I didn't know that the Gray Raven Commandant would be the person the rumor says...	Is there such a rumor?																					
33	33		201							1	500273																							
34	34		301							1	Wanshi	...Ah. So you've also sent them to others as well...	1																					
35	35		301			PanelActor1Shake	AniZhuanchangBegin					You leap toward Wanshi and cover his mouth before dragging him away with an embarrassed smile under the mischievous gazes of the other commandants.	1

37	37		302			AniZhuanchangEnd					Don't say such weird stuff in public!	38																						
38	38		301			DialogEnable					Wanshi	Weird stuff? What do you mean?	1																					
39	39		301									Wanshi seems so unconcerned that you cannot help but wonder if you were making a big deal out of it.																						
40	40		302								Um...	41																						
41	41		301								Wanshi	Does that mean I can say it now?	1																					
42	42		302								Uh...	43																						
43	43		301								Wanshi	So, then, the things you gave meâ€”you can't give the same gifts to someone else.	1																					
44	44		302								It's not about that!	45																						
45	45		301								Wanshi	Oh, so you do want to practice one-on-one then?	1																					
46	46		301								Wanshi	I can continue where we left off last time.	1																					
47	47		301								Wanshi	Plus, I'll give it my best shot.	1																					
48	48		301									As Wanshi says this, he lifts the stock of his rifle upward, making a clear and crisp sound. He seems to be serious, judging from the intensity of his manner, which makes you a bit nervous instead.																						
49	49		302								Well, that's not quite necessary...	50																						
50	50		204							1																								
51	51		301								Wanshi	Isn't that what you want? To be treated with respect as an opponent...	1																					
52	52		204							1	1																							
53	53		301								Wanshi	I'm the Wish Machine, after all.	1																					
54	54		302								Are you messing with me like you do those kids?	55																						
55	55		301								Wanshi	I'm not messing with you... It's just that I like the way we interact with children.	1																					
56	56		301								Wanshi	Let's get started if you're ready.	1																					
57	57		204							1	1																							
58	58		301								Wanshi	It's rare for me to take this seriously.	1																					
59	59		302								Fine.	60																						
60	60		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					His eyes light up, in a way you have never seen before.
