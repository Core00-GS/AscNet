49	49		301								Noctis	That Ascendant? Which Ascendant?	2																					
50	50		301								Vera	...Tsk. Luna. Based on what has been revealed from the frontline reports, that female Ascendant leader has been missing since she was heavily wounded, hasn't she?	1																					
51	51		301								Vera	She's probably the Ascendant the top brass wants the most... but why us?	1																					
52	52		301								Noctis	Okay, I see. They want us to catch a lone Ascendant.	2

85	84		301									Your only link to the outside world is a small window, roughly ten square centimeters in size, which you can open.																						
86	85		301									On the other side of the glass are agents in black suits, their hairstyles and faces indistinguishable to you. They look like clones if you do not pay attention.

92	91		301									Dismissed, you close your eyes once more.																						
93	92		301									Perhaps the exhaustion and stress have begun to numb your senses. If others peek at you now, all they can see is an expression of "emptiness" and nothing else.

116	115		302								Who is it?	116	Kurono.	117																				
117	116	118	301								Hassen	Kurono. Despite having merged with Babylonia, their forces have never stopped working in the dark. Right now, you're wounded prey to them, and that has stirred up some bloodthirsty sharks.	1																					
118	117		301								Hassen	That's right. Of course you've figured it out.	1																					
119	118		301								Hassen	But the Parliament isn't happy about that.	1																					
120	119		301								Hassen	I mentioned that if Kurono got their hands on you and had things their way, we'd no longer be in control.	1																					
121	120		301								Hassen	But if we are forced to let you carry out what they've planned...	1																					
122	121		302								...We'll just have to include that in our plans as well.	122																						
123	122		301								Hassen	I'll not allow Kurono to treat a Babylonia commandant this way. We have to find a junction during the clashes with these sharks to get you back on the right track.	1																					
124	123		301								Hassen	This will be our first junction, as well as our first step to strike back.	1																					
125	124		302								What exactly are we going to do?	125																						
126	125		301								Hassen	You'll find out soon enough.	1																					
127	126		301								Hassen	We're all in the current now. It's no longer up to us if we go with the flow.	1																					
128	127		301								Hassen	But you have my words, 【kuroname】. You'll likely be involved in an operation soon... They say it's to look for the Ascendant Luna's whereabouts, but...	1																					
129	128		302								I accept.	129																						
130	129		301								Hassen	That quickly, huh? I thought you'd want some time to think.	1																					
131	130		302								The time alone in the interrogation room is long enough for me to think it through.	131																						
132	131		301								Hassen	Haha... Gray Raven Commandant, I still believe in you unwaveringly.	1																					
133	132		301								Hassen	Even though my words can hardly account for anything given your situation... but I hope you'll do the same—believe in us.	1																					
134	133		301								Hassen	We'll do our best to guarantee your safety. The team assigned to you this time is the one you can trust the most, even if it took us some effort to get their commandant to go along. That guy is sharp.	1																					
135	134		302								I see.	135																						
136	135		301								Hassen	...【kuroname】, if I may—aren't you afraid?	1																					
137	136		302								I'm never afraid.	137	A little bit.	138																				
138	137		302								Because I know I'm never alone.	141																						
139	138		301								Hassen	You don't act like it.	1																					
140	139		302								Because, in the face of fear...	140																						
141	140		302								Choosing to keep going is what makes me who I am.	141	I refuse to let it hurt those I want to protect.	141																				
142	141		301								Hassen	...I see, 【kuroname】.	1																					
143	142		301								Hassen	I've got five minutes left. Maybe I can get you to meet your team one more time.	1																					
144	143		301								Hassen	What do you think?	1

147	146		302								...That's not necessary.	147

172	171		301								Rebecca	I'm not here to find out how she and you are related.	1

174	173		301									She holds more power, her agenda more clear.																						
175	174		301									That is good. You are sick of the pleasantries repeated time and time again.																						
176	175		301								Rebecca	We both have something we want. It's pointless for us to keep fighting, so why don't we both take a step back and focus on our shared goal?	1

187	186		301								Rebecca	Alright, you've made your stance clear. I'll skip the pointless act and be honest with you.	1

227	228		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		An overgrown path lies before you as the hazy vision shakes and sways, and you find two Constructs you do not know standing on the other side.																						
228	229		301									The female Construct is frowning lightly, a small laser cannon hovering by her side. Behind her also stands a strange, orb-shaped robot, its arms waving.																						
229	230		301									Next to her stands a tall, red-haired Construct, one of his hands scratching the back of his head, seemingly confused by the unknown connection.																						
230	231		301								No. 21	Unfamiliar. It's not our commandant?	1

233	234		301							1	Vera	It's not him.	1																					
234	235		301									The Construct syncing with you is none other than Vera. The team Hassen said you could trust the most... is Cerberus?

241	242		301							1	Vera	Perhaps they've transferred Murray to the Hellhounds. They're much better than you two, after all.	1

261	262		302								Um. Hi? I'm the Gray Raven Commandant.	263

271	272		301							1	Noctis	We've been in two operations that the Gray Raven Commandant was involved, but neither 21 nor I were on the field, so this is the first time we connect with this commandant!	2																					
272	273		301								No. 21	...	1																					
273	274		301									No. 21 does not speak. The little robot, on the other hand, starts rotating around her.

276	277		301							1	Vera	The big, dumb one is Noctis. He climbs. The small one is 21. She blows up the tree Noctis is climbing. Now we're all introduced, let's confirm our assignment again—I hope you aren't coming empty-handed, Commandant?	1																					
277	278		302								What kind of introduction is this?	279	Right, let me restate the mission brief.	279																				
278	279		301									The higher-ups have detected M.I.N.D. activity that matches Luna in this area. Your mission is to investigate the signal and search for her possible whereabouts.																						
279	280		302								(Repeat mission brief)	281																						
280	281		301								Vera	I knew it's got something to do with that Ascendant when you're involved. You're actually an Ascendant radar, aren't you?	1																					
281	282		301								Vera	Just humor the commandant's orders when I'm not talking—I'm kidding! Can't have you two going off the rails.	1

286	287		301									No. 21 still has not spoken. She takes a look at you before walking ahead.

293	294		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Noctis chases behind her and finds a traffic sign covered in dust lying horizontally before them, blocking their way.																						
294	295		301									"Welcome home!"																						
295	296		301									Says the sign. A small line, handwritten next to it, reads, "P.S. Call Sheriff Byron if needed. The number is—" The number is scratched off. A giant arrow is painted on the right, pointing at a mailbox next to the sign.																						
296	297		301									Noctis steps forward and opens the mailbox. He coughs from the raised dust before picking up a sheet of paper from within, raising it high after taking a glance.

302	303		301									Having expressed his displeasure to No. 21 for ignoring him, Noctis folds the map in half, fuming, putting it inside his pocket.

304	305		301							1	Vera	How are you feeling, Commandant?	1																					
305	306		301									Vera, staying at the back of the team, addresses you with a question in a conversation only the two of you can hear.																						
306	307		301								Vera	Gotten invited to help, haven't you? I've more or less figured it out, but seeing your... nah, sensing your helpless frustration...	1																					
307	308		301								Vera	This... does put a smile on my face. Don't worry, 【kuroname】. I'll take good care of you.	1
