11	10		301								Household Robot R2	Command contravenes priority command. Executing priority command.

15	13		301								Langston	Is he in the study? Will I disturb him if I go now?	1																					
16	14		301									Langston seems pleased by the repeated command, but he soon calms himself down and puts down the items in his hands.

25	22		301								???	Come in.	3																					
26	23		301								Langston	Understood.	2																					
27	24		301								John	I received your report card on my terminal.	3																					
28	25		301								Langston	...Yes.	2																					
29	26		301								John	Not bad.	3																					
30	27		301									John Smith curves a finger and taps the virtual screen twice, causing it to blink and vanish.																						
31	28		301								John	4.721... Even though this is just an in-class pop-quiz... Why have you not gotten a 5?	3																					
32	29		301								John	I will no longer allow flaws like this. Understood?	3																					
33	30		301								John	You're my son, after all. The son of John Smith.	3																					
34	31		301								John	You're the best, the perfect creation.	3																					
35	32		301								Langston	Okay.	2																					
36	33		301								John	Good.	3																					
37	34		301								John	I had R2 sift through your database and delete all unrelated data.	3																					
38	35		301								John	Tales from the early Golden Age, pointless mumbling, flowery prose, meaningless stories, Edgar—what kind name is that? They really didn't care what garbage they hauled up during the Great Retreat.	3																					
39	36		301								John	Langston, surely you understand what your duty is as my son?	3																					
40	37		301								Langston	Gather everything useful, piece them together, and create a perfect self.	2																					
41	38		301								John	All Smiths have always been perfect. I brought you back and made you my son, so that you'll become a Smith, my perfect self.	3																					
42	39		301								Langston	...	2																					
43	40		301								John	Of course, on the day I retire, you'll become the next Smith. You should understand that this arrangement benefits you too.	3																					
44	41		301									The father says this every day to the son. Langston understands very well what it means.																						
45	42		301									He's in awe of his father and follows his every order. He used to be nothing, after all. Smith was the only reason Langston was able to become what he currently is.																						
46	43		301									Smith is the only correct answer. Langston's one and only dream is to become a Smith. The world starts with Smith—and ends with him, too.																						
47	44		301									This is Langston's world.																						
48	45		301								John	I heard that the final connection exam for Commandant selection will be held in three days.	3																					
49	47		301								Langston	Mr. Smith, the instructor told me that the exam will not be held in actual combat format. Is that true?	2																					
50	48		301								John	It was supposed to be actual combat in the beginning, but they're low on manpower, both Commandants and Constructs. The only Constructs remaining in Babylonia are probably that batch marked as exclusive to Kurono.	3																					
51	49		301								John	But it's better that way. In a combat exam, we'll have to take care of an extra element: the quality of the Construct. Surely you wouldn't want a flawed product to ruin your plans, "Smith".	3																					
52	50		301								Langston	Understood.	2																					
53	51		301								Household Robot R2	Mr. Smith, it's 7 a.m. The main agenda today is the committee meeting, where the No. 7 Surface HQ will be constructed.																						
54	52		301								John	So it's time? Don't be late, Langston. It's time I leave.	3																					
55	53		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Smith, the one on the throne, soon leaves with his butler robot. The one who stays, on the other hand, stands reverently, head lowered, waiting for the door to close.
