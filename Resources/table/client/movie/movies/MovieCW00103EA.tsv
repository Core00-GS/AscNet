10	10		301								Bianca	What is it?	1																					
11	11		301								Asimov	After you brought Toniris back... We found more testers to continue with the experiments.	2																					
12	12		301								Asimov	But Toniris' response level is far below ideal.	2																					
13	13		301								Asimov	I'm quoting Allen here. "Maybe Toniris has already found itself a master."	2																					
14	14		301								Asimov	That's why I want to hear more details from you.	2

19	19		301							1	Asimov	I see. So that's what happened.	2																					
20	20		301								Asimov	That's why I said we shouldn't incorporate too many bionic elements in tactical equipment. Toniris apparently has a poor affinity with anyone but Bianca.	2																					
21	21		301								Asimov	This issue must be addressed seriously from the next unit onward.	2																					
22	22		301								Asimov	Admittedly, Toniris' combat data and synchronization broke all current records in that battle.	2																					
23	23		301								Asimov	But it is a piece of tactical equipment after all. If it can only reach its full potential with certain individuals, such equipment is flawed.	2																					
24	24		301								Asimov	Our mission is to make equipment that can be fully utilized by all combatants.	2

27	27		301							1	Bianca	I understand...	1																					
28	28		301								Asimov	But... Like what I just said, Toniris' potential could be fully realized under certain conditions.	2																					
29	29		301								Asimov	That's why I want you to bring Toniris whenever possible during your missions.	2																					
30	30		301								Bianca	...?	1																					
31	31		301								Asimov	I will never ignore outstanding performance and potential. If you can collect enough data during the collaboration with Toniris...	2																					
32	32		301								Asimov	Then perhaps we may be able to reach the same synergy again. This does not contradict our purpose.	2																					
33	33		301								Bianca	Are you saying that... Toniris and I can fight together from now on?	1																					
34	34		301								Asimov	Correct. And it is your duty to record and analyze the data of every single battle.	2																					
35	35		204							1	1																							
36	36		301								Bianca	Understood.	1																					
37	37		301								Asimov	Alright, let's go meet Toniris.	2

45	45		301									Toniris was standing in the center of the artificial courtyard.																						
46	46		301									Quiet and calm as always.																						
47	47		301									It was born to help creatures who could not live alone, to teach them the skills they needed to survive.																						
48	48		301									Yet they saw it as different until it was buried in the wasteland.																						
49	49		301									But now, it had a visitor who was very similar to itself.																						
50	50		301									She has expanded Toniris' world.																						
51	51		301									For some reason, Toniris knew she would visit her once again.																						
52	52		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					—And she would make its world more complete.
