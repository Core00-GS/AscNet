19	20		301									More booms, even louder, sound from outside the city. Though Camu is too far to witness the event, he knows that it is the sound of their mobile base being bombed.																						
20	21		301									They sent Camu's squad into the city and started bombing them... even destroyed their vehicle so they could not leave.																						
21	22		301									"Destroy everything—Don't leave even a speck of dust behind. Headquarters' orders."

24	25		301									Everything makes sense now. Kurono has always had a shady reputation, but Camu never imagined that it would come to this.																						
25	26		301									What did he do wrong? What did the others do wrong? Why does this have to happen?																						
26	27		301									Did they mess up on any missions? Or did he do something unacceptable at the gate?																						
27	28		301									No. None of those are the main reason.

29	30		301									Camu remembers his first squadmate to pass away in an "accident." He was completely unscathed in battle, yet died right afterward.																						
30	31		301									After that happened, several others perished in similar ways. Camu tried to ask the officials about it each time—																						
31	32		301									Yet all he got was silence.																						
32	33		301								Camu	Dammit, I'm not dying here!	1																					
33	34		301									Camu grips his greatsword tight and rushes toward his confused squadmates. He slices his way through the obstacles and grabs their hands.
