5	5		301									The Nigher is filled with merchants and performance goers. Although it is not crowded, the boat is alive with festivity.																						
6	6		301									Ever since the Nighter was occupied by the Akdilek Commercial Alliance, they established a temporary onboard filtering device that revived commerce on the ship. However, gray market goods were explicitly prohibited.																						
7	7		301									The ship's prosperous and delightful atmosphere is a rare sight to be seen in the wasteland.																						
8	8		301									After completing their mission, the Gray Ravens once again boarded the Nighter.																						
9	9		301								Male Musician	(Whimpers) My music... "Like nails on a chalkboard," she say...																						
10	10		301									You hear a man weep as he comes down from the stage. His head hangs down, dejected.																						
11	11		201							1	500145	1																						
12	12		301							1	Pulao	Ahahaha... What a shame!	1																					
13	13		302								Isn't that Pulao...?	14																						
14	14		201							1	500127																							
15	15		301							1	Sophia	The Female Construct on stage is looking for a partner. Apparently there's quite a lot of prize money at stake. Pulao was invited to serve as the host.	1																					
16	16		302								Sophia, what are you doing here?	17																						
17	17		301								Sophia	Pulao invited me here on my off time... I can earn a quick buck while I'm at it.	1																					
18	18		302								...You said "partner"? But that's a Construct...	19																						
19	19		301								Sophia	Yup, everyone's coming to see what all the fuss is about.	1																					
20	20		201							1	500145	1																						
21	21		301							1	Pulao	Next contestant! It's showtime!	1																					
22	22		202							1					1																			
23	23		301									Despite the huge reward, no one responds... Only Sophia raises her hand.																						
24	24		302								Sophia, are you sure you know what "partner" means?	25																						
25	25		201							1	500127																							
26	26		301							1	Sophia	Nope. But that's a lot money.	1																					
27	27		201							1	500145																							
28	28		301							1	Pulao	Don't... Don't worry about it. If I can't find anyone, they'll cut my pay... Please, miss!	1																					
29	29		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				Are you sure about that?!	30

32	32		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The Female Construct stands up from her chair, finally revealing her face for the audience to clearly see.																						
33	33		201							1	500161																							
34	34		301							1	Female Construct	...	1																					
35	35		201							1	500127																							
36	36		301							1	Sophia	Whether it's business knowledge, mech assembly, astronomical calculations or fighting with a gun...	1																					
37	37		301								Sophia	No one can beat me. Just try me.	1																					
38	38		301									The Female Construct looks Sophia over, then slowly takes a seat.																						
39	39		201							1	500161																							
40	40		301							1	Female Construct	Too short. Goodbye.	1																					
41	41		201							1	500127	10																						
42	42		301							1	Sophia	Huh...? I... lost.	1																					
43	43		301									Sophia walks off the stage a little confused and appears to be knocked down a peg.																						
44	44		302								It's okay, Sophia. Don't take it to heart...	45																						
45	45		202							1					1																			
46	46		301									Contestants come and go, but no one leaves with their composure in check. As more and more people are humiliated, contestants off stage begin to grow restless.																						
47	47		301									At this time, the male Construct musician who performed the song just now couldn't help but rush onto the stage and give them a piece of his mind.																						
48	48		301								Male Musician	You aren't even looking for a partner! You're using us for your own amusement!																						
49	49		201							1	500161																							
50	50		301							1	Female Construct	I have no reason to lie. You all failed because of your own weaknesses. And even IF I were playing you—what could you do about it?	1																					
51	51		202							1					1																			
52	52		301								Male Musician	I can't take it anymore! I'll show you not to mess with us!																						
53	53		301									Backed by the angry cheers of those off stage, the male musician rushes to attack the Female Construct.																						
54	54		301									The Female Construct stops Pulao from interfering and steps forward to challenge him herself.																						
55	55		301								Male Musician	Argh...																						
56	56		301									Before anyone has any time to react, the Female Construct kicks the musician into the air.																						
57	57		301									However, that was just the beginning. She unleashes a flurry of perfectly executed kicks, not even giving the man time to breathe.																						
58	58		201							1	500127																							
59	59		301							1	Sophia	She'll kill him if she keeps this up!	1																					
60	60		302								...	61																						
61	61		301								Sophia	Wait! Where are you going?	1																					
62	62		202							1					1																			
63	63		301									The relentless assault has already left the man beaten to a pulp. He can barely stand on his own two feet.																						
64	64		302								Stop! That's enough!	65																						
65	65		201							1	500161																							
66	66		301							1	Female Construct	Hmph... Are you going to protect a Construct you've never even met before?	1																					
67	67		302								What are you talking about?	68																						
68	68		301								Female Construct	Fine. If this piece of junk can beat me with your help, I'll make you my partner.	1																					
69	69		302								What makes you think I want that...?	70																						
70	70		301								Female Construct	Then you have no business here. This stage is for me to pick a partner.	1																					
71	71		202							1					1																			
72	72		301								Male Musician	You're... Gray Raven Commandant?!																						
73	73		301								Male Musician	Damnit, she's tricked us all... Hey, Commandant! You gotta help us teach her a lesson!																						
74	74		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				Alright, I promise.	76																						
75	76		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory157.png																								
76	77		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You are not able to establish an immediate M.I.N.D. connection with him, but knowing your opponent's weakness gives you the upper hand.																						
77	78		201							1	500127																							
78	79		301							1	Sophia	I fixed you up for the time being, but...	1																					
79	80		301								Male Musician	Don't worry! That'll do. I won't lose this time.																						
80	81		301								Sophia	What'd you whisper into his ear? Why the sudden boost in confidence?	1																					
81	82		302								My lips are sealed...	83																						
82	83		201							1	500161																							
83	84		301							1	Female Construct	You continue to fight despite being doomed to fail. How foolish...	1																					
84	85		202							1					1																			
85	86		301									Suddenly, she launches another kick at lightning speed. However, this time it is a swing and a miss.																						
86	87		302								Attack her back leg!	88																						
87	88		301									In response, the musician attacks the Female Construct's back left leg exposed from the high-velocity kick.																						
88	89		201							1	500161																							
89	90		301							1	Female Construct	Mmph...	1																					
90	91		302								Turn to defend!	92																						
91	92		202							1					1																			
92	93		301									The musician turns and blocks the kick with his upper right arm. However, the Female Construct uses the force from the kick to jump back and clear the distance between the two of them.																						
93	94		301								Male Musician	Rgh...																						
94	95		301									He may have blocked the kick, but his hastily repaired arm begins to ignite with sparks.																						
95	96		302								(That attack must be...)	97																						
96	97		201							1	500161																							
97	98		301							1	Female Construct	Hmph... Trash will always be tra...	1																					
98	99		301									But before she can finish speaking, she falls to her knees. Only then does she realize that the kick had severely damaged her leg.																						
99	100		301								Female Construct	You countered my kick... Clever...	1																					
100	101		301								Female Construct	That battle's not over yet. Keep going.	1																					
101	102		302								No, it's over. We forfeit.	103																						
102	103		202							1					1																			
103	104		301								Male Musician	What?! I've still got fight in me!																						
104	105		201							1	500127																							
105	106		301							1	Sophia	Any more damage will be going overboard. It's not worth the trouble.	1																					
106	107		201							1	500161																							
107	108		301							1	Female Construct	Forfeiting because you're worried about him...? Hmph, that's ridiculous!	1																					
108	109		301								Female Construct	This battle was devoid of all beauty. My partner must be determined to use everything as if it was their own.	1																					
109	110		302								I can't do that.	111																						
110	111		301								Female Construct	Still so naive... But as per the rules of this contest, I am the loser.	1																					
111	112		202							1					1																			
112	113		301									The Female Construct snaps her fingers, breaking open the large box behind her seat. A bunch of grub coins spills out onto the floor, the likes of which no one present had ever seen before.																						
113	114		201							1	500145																							
114	115		301							1	Pulao	C-congratulations, 【kuroname】! All this grub—wait, minus the share I was promised—is yours...!	1																					
115	116		202							1					1																			
116	117		301									While everyone's attention is drawn away, the Female Construct vanishes without a word.																						
117	118		201							1	500145																							
118	119		301							1	Pulao	Uh... My share is 5%... But how much is 5%?!	1																					
119	120		302								Give the rest to the musician.	121																						
120	121		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Pulao	Wait! Where are you going?!	1

123	124		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Leaving the stage in a hurry, you find the Female Construct leaning on the nearby railing.																						
124	125		201							1	500161																							
125	126		301							1	Female Construct	You found me...	1																					
126	127		302								Who exactly are you?	128																						
127	128		301								Female Construct	Didn't you already figure that out from the fight?	1																					
128	129		301								Female Construct	Gotta hand it to you though. You saw right through my attack...	1																					
129	130		302								How could I forget?	131	I couldn't forget even if I tried.	131																				
130	131		301								Female Construct	I don't think my body could've taken much more. You beat me fair and square. Sure is embarrassing getting hurt so bad.	1																					
131	132		301									She is obviously disappointed with her injured leg, but seeing the "collar" around your neck seems to have given her an idea.																						
132	133		301								Female Construct	Good thing you're still carrying this collar. Let me borrow it for a bit.	1																					
133	134		202							1					1																			
134	135		301									You feel a tingling pain in your neck and your vision goes blurry for a moment before quickly returning to normal. After you open your eyes, you see that the Female Construct has changed her appearance.

136	137		201							1	500150																							
137	138		301							1	Qu	I tweaked your visuals. Who do you see now?	1																					
138	139		302								Qu... I knew it was you.	140																						
139	140		301								Qu	The same technique naturally has the same weakness. I was just using the collar to control this Construct.	1																					
140	141		302								What are you planning?!	142																						
141	142		301									To your surprise, Qu seems a bit confused.																						
142	143		301								Qu	I don't exactly know what looking for a partner means, but I was taught by my family that, once I reached a certain age, I had to find one to be with me for the rest of my life.	1																					
143	144		301								Qu	Even though a Construct like me has no concept of age, but a rule is a rule.	1																					
144	145		301								Qu	The path to greatness is one of loneliness... Not to mention, I'm strong enough that I don't need anyone to be my partner.	1																					
145	146		301								Qu	But traditions are meant to be upheld. That is all.	1																					
146	147		302								Looks like you don't know what "partner" means either...	148																						
147	148		202							1					1																			
148	149		301									Qu lets out a "Hmph!" and turns to leave.																						
149	151		301							1	Qu	I just wanted to humiliate you on a whim. I wasn't expecting you to win...	1																					
150	152		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	Gray Raven Commandant... Come with me. Call it a fluke, but you're now my partner. There's something I need to show you.	1
