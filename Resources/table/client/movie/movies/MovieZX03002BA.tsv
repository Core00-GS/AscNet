14	14		301								Bianca	I'll upload the relevant data after the mission. Please do not interrupt our operation unprompted again.	2																					
15	15		301								Bianca	I believe I've mentioned that to you before, Vesalius.	2

30	30		301									The pale female figure turns her gaze toward you while she waits for the data transfer to complete.																						
31	31		302								I am.	32																						
32	32		301								Vesalius	I heard you directly connected your Mind Beacon to a Corrupted in a previous mission.	1																					
33	33		302								That's right.	34																						
34	34		204							1	13																							
35	35		301								Vesalius	Hah. No wonder they were so confident and didn't even bother to arrange a recovering plan for you.	1																					
36	36		301								Vesalius	You're certainly much more capable than the last Gray Raven Commandant.	1																					
37	37		204							1																								
38	38		301								Vesalius	How did the Deep M.I.N.D. connection with Stigmata feel? Is there any difference to repairing Empyrea's—it's Eclipse now, isn't it—M.I.N.D.?	1																					
39	39		302								Their names are Bianca and Liv.	40																						
40	40		204							1	5																							
41	41		301								Vesalius	?	1																					
42	42		301									For some reason, Vesalius seems inclined to call Constructs by the codenames of their frames instead of their actual names.																						
43	43		204							1	13																							
44	44		301									She grins mockingly, seemingly having thought of something.																						
45	45		301								Vesalius	Singing the same tune, are we?	1																					
46	46		301								Vesalius	"A familiar appearance would help stabilize the M.I.N.D..."	1																					
47	47		301								Vesalius	"Recognizing your own face will keep the M.I.N.D. from deviating..."	1																					
48	48		301									Vesalius' smile grows ever more sarcastic.																						
49	49		301								Vesalius	I thought someone who spent every day and night with Constructs would stop fooling themselves at some point.	1																					
50	50		301								Vesalius	Should I commend you for being the "hero" the Parliament meticulously "adorned"? Have those pretty "ribbons" ensnare your critical thinking?	1																					
51	51		301								Vesalius	If it's foolish to think that "Constructs are mere tools," it's equally foolish to think that "Constructs are just humans."	1																					
52	52		301								Vesalius	A perfect body, a controlled path of evolution, and an independent mind...	1																					
53	53		301								Vesalius	Constructs are a new life form. They are the next step of the evolution.	1

60	60		301							1	Vesalius	Perhaps your name meant a lot to your past as a human, but your frame's codename is what anchors you in this new form of life. It's unwise to avoid it.	1																					
61	61		301								Vesalius	You keep telling yourself you're human, but you wield powers a human can only dream of. This discrepancy can't be swept away with a few pretty words.	1																					
62	62		301								Vesalius	The main reason for M.I.N.D. deviation is the disconnection between your self and reality. How do you remain yourself if you won't confront your distinctions?	1

86	86		301								Vesalius	The shorter-than-benchmark runtime wasn't unexpected. You weren't our first choice, after all.	1																					
87	87		301									She reads a few more pages and gets growingly displeased.																						
88	88		301								Vesalius	The hallucinations appeared immediately afterward... That data doesn't seem to be completely useless.	1																					
89	89		301								Vesalius	It's surprising and fascinating, but it also proves that your M.I.N.D. was deviating before your hallucinations appeared.	1																					
90	90		301								Vesalius	You should heed my warning, Stigmata.	1																					
91	91		301								Vesalius	Eliminating the Punishing Virus isn't the only way forward. The Phantom Tracer was made to decipher the data within the Punishing Virus.	1																					
92	92		301								Vesalius	To utilize a weapon of the Punishing Virus half-heartedly in your half-hearted form will only create a greater disconnection within yourself.	1

100	100		301								Vesalius	You'll still run into these hallucinations later, anyway.	1																					
101	101		301								Vesalius	I look forward to the data these unanticipated phenomena provide.	1																					
102	102		301								Vesalius	Remember to stabilize her M.I.N.D. with a Deep M.I.N.D. connection in time. I don't want my work to become something one-and-done.	1																					
103	103		301								Vesalius	Not that we have more tissues from the Hetero-Hive Mother to make another Phantom Tracer.	1

110	110		301							1	Bianca	She's the lead researcher from Kurono I mentioned before, Commandant.	1

113	113		204							1	5																							
114	114		301								Bianca	This coating wasn't what the Stigmata frame looked like. The original form... leans more toward the stereotypes of the Purifying Force and witches...	1																					
115	115		301								Bianca	But considering that a familiar appearance can help stabilize the M.I.N.D., we made this coating in response to the short production time of the frame.	1																					
116	116		204							1	8

119	119		301									Bianca seems to think of something right as she says that. A rare hint of hesitation flashes across her eyes, but it quickly disappears, replaced by her usual determination.																						
120	120		301								Bianca	We took too long to upload that data, Commandant. We should proceed with our mission.	1																					
121	121		302								...	122																						
122	122		301									A hastily made frame, a temporary coating, a replacement for the top candidate... you have more or less understood what happened from their conversation.
