10	10		301								Celica	...Babylonia and the corrupted space state just narrowly missed each other. The firefight is over now.	1																					
11	11		301								Celica	Air-to-ground communication has been mostly restored, but there's still interference from the corrupted space station.	1																					
12	12		301								Celica	We found the battle log you back. The situation looks... grim. I'm worried about your current situation.	1																					
13	13		301								Lucia	We scavenged some supplies and have recovered. We can continue with the mission. Please don't worry.	2																					
14	14		301								Celica	...Thank goodness you're alright.	1																					
15	15		301								Lucia	We were tracking a special graffiti-painting Corrupted unit and require the locational help from Babylonia. The Corrupted model version has just been uploaded.	2																					
16	16		301								Celica	Ok—found it. I've marked the target location and route on your map.	1																					
17	17		301								Celica	You need to cross a shopping street, but then there's a defensive line crawling with Corrupted. It won't be easy getting past them, but I believe in you.	1																					
18	18		301								Lucia	Roger. Thank you for the intel.	2

78	78		301									Lucia turns silent for a short while after receiving the plushie, staring at it with an unmoving gaze.																						
79	79		301								Liv	Lucia, you've... really taken a liking to this plushie.																						
80	80		301								Lucia	Maybe... It's just that, looking at it fills me with a strange feeling.
