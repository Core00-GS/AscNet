12	12		301								Luna?	An illusion, not an imagination. I'm a story your memories put together.	1																					
13	13		301									Nothing that Lucia says has changed anything. Her M.I.N.D. is slowly being contaminated by the red lights.																						
14	14		301								Luna?	The bond you've always believed in is the real illusion here.	1																					
15	15		301								Lucia	No... It's not like that...	2																					
16	16		301								???	Let me show you, then... What I've seen, what the Ascension-Network has shown me, and what you're about to experience.	1

21	21		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Memories of when the planet formed, when oceans abounded with life, when lives were born.

26	26		301									To stay alive, the weak have learned to be even more despicable.																						
27	27		301									They deceive, betray, pretend, and lie...

34	34		301									The monster does not cross the river in time, and its body gradually decays, leaving traces of blood on the ground.																						
35	35		301									In that instant, the barriers supporting Lucia collapse. Her vision is now dark with the rubble pinning her firmly to the ground, the red dots of light afloat taunting her.																						
36	36		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Infected and on the verge of being devoured, Lucia hears a voice.

49	49		301								Voice from Afar	I believe in you the way you've believed in us... So... believe in yourself, Lucia...!																						
50	50		301									She looks in the direction from which the voice came. Right above the abyss, a beacon shines bright, the same way a star would at the dead of night.
