8	8		301								Nanami	Okay. Thanks!	2																					
9	9		301								Nanami	My plan to stop Zero failed. Nanami is going to have to try even harder for what's coming next.	2																					
10	10		301								Nanami	I need to catch up on what's going on and find a terminal.	2																					
11	11		301									Seeing Nanami has put herself together, Haicma lets out a relieved sigh.																						
12	12		301								Spuner	Here it is—a compilation of profiles on the Church's core members and files on the major events throughout the war up until now. What do you need these for, though, Sage?																						
13	13		301								Spuner	I didn't know that our first conflict with humankind went way back until I began sorting through these files...

15	15		301									Quietly, Spooner glances at Haicma, who looks away just as quietly.

17	17		301								Nanami	Did it have anything to do with Haicma?	2																					
18	18		301								Haicma	...Yes, I was. I'm sorry, Sage.	1																					
19	19		204							1																								
20	20		301								Haicma	I joined Project Ark many years ago as a core member of the Church and launched its first attack against humankind on "Eden" with Trailblazer.	1																					
21	21		301								Haicma	The reason was... If you would like to know...	1																					
22	22		301								Spuner	It's all history now, and the machines didn't start fighting with humans because of you.																						
23	23		301								Spuner	Things might have been very different now had you already been part of the Church then, Sage.																						
24	24		301								Nanami	Was I not around?	2																					
25	25		301								Haicma	...That would be correct, because I still hadn't found you then, Sage.	1																					
26	26		301									Haicma looks away. She seems to be blaming herself.

28	28		301								Nanami	Don't worry. This time, I will make sure to witness you!	2

38	38		301							1	Haicma	...Yes.	1																					
39	39		301									Haicma is not entirely sure what Nanami is thinking, but seeing her smile, Haicma smiles back all the same.

48	48		301									They are standing in front of a gigantic valve in a corner of the square.																						
49	49		301								Haicma	That would be correct—and unfortunately, the equipment is the core of the "Gray Tower".	1																					
50	50		301								Nanami	Is the core of this tower just underneath it?	2																					
51	51		301								Haicma	Given the core is responsible for all the Church's computing demands and the fact that "Gear" led the construction of the "Gray Tower", we'll most likely have to deal with heavy security there.	1																					
52	52		301								Spuner	You won't be able to hide it from them. There is no secret in the Church of Machina.																						
53	53		301									Spooner points at its head.																						
54	54		301								Spuner	Communication amongst the worshippers of the "Sanctuary" is transparent.																						
55	55		301								Nanami	Typical of a mechanoid organization that's this big, I suppose... But isn't this a little too...	2
