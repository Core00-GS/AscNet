3	3		301			DialogEnable						Opening her eyes after the brief memory, Alpha clenches her left fist.																						
4	4		201							1	500100																							
5	5		301							1	α	How many of my memories did you see in my M.I.N.D., Lucia?	1																					
6	6		202							1					1																			
7	7		301									The mission from Ascnet, or the pitiful wish of those wishing to ascend, but reaching a dead end? Or could it even be those despicable traps by the humans?																						
8	8		301									But more than likely, she had only caught a few scattered fragments in a hurry.																						
9	9		301									Besides that incident, which Lucia will surely recall, Alpha has other countless memories of nights when she was fed up with the senseless sacrifices.																						
10	10		201							1	500100																							
11	11		301							1	α	...But the killing did not stop at the living. Even the memories for those that have passed on, the hints of warmth they left behind, were brutally destroyed.	1																					
12	12		202							1					1																			
13	13		301									That is the only thing she cannot forgive.																						
14	14		201							1	500066																							
15	15		301							1	???	That was when it started, wasn't it?	1																					
16	16		202							1					1																			
17	17		301									Suddenly, Alpha hears a noise in her head. She shakes her head.																						
18	18		201							1	500066																							
19	19		301							1	???	You were gradually robbed of everything you had and ended up with nothing.	1																					
20	20		301								???	But it was because of this that the Ascendants began their subsequent operations.	1																					
21	21		301								???	—Heading to Kowloong to steal Huaxu was to topple the main culprit hiding in Eden's shadow.	1																					
22	22		301								???	Although they each had their own reason for doing so...	1																					
23	23		202							1					1																			
24	24		301									The crackling noise echoes in her hearing module.																						
25	25		301									As Luna said, the noise serves as a catalyst, constantly stirring up thoughts buried deep in the M.I.N.D. and amplifying ill will.																						
26	26		301									Alpha knows that strong emotions are the basis of an Ascendant. Only with them can one obtain the energy of the Ascension-Network.																						
27	27		201							1	500066																							
28	28		301							1	???	Be the newest agent and gain the strength to keep advancing.	1																					
29	29		201							1	500100																							
30	30		301							1	α	I don't need it.	1																					
31	31		202							1					1																			
32	2001		301									Alpha is not fully sure why she received the invitation from the Ascension-Network.																						
33	2002		301									It could be due to a factor she possesses, or a combination of conditions, but whatever it is, it does not matter to her.																						
34	2003		301									Because she will reject it anyway.																						
35	33		201							1	500066																							
36	34		301							1	???	You don't have anything left, no family, no comrades... How will you take on so many enemies by yourself? How will you save Luna?	1																					
37	35		201							1	500100																							
38	36		301							1	α	...	1																					
39	37		202							1					1																			
40	38		301									Alpha does not respond. She ignores the agitating noise and makes for an area she has not searched. Even if it were swarming with enemies and there was not much hope, she would still continuing searching.																						
41	39		301									Suddenly, a transport craft with the Babylonia insignia lands a distance away. The hatch opens and a person walks out.																						
42	40		201							1	500100																							
43	41		301							1	α	Such concentration of the Punishing Virus... An Ascendant? No... he isn't connected to Ascnet. Why did he come here alone?	1																					
44	42		202							1					1																			
45	43		301									Once the transport craft departs, Alpha follows him, suspicious. She sees him approaching his comrades.																						
46	44		201							1	500100																							
47	45		301							1	α	Are they here for the remnants of the Red Tide or to search for Luna?	1																					
48	46		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She dodged into the ruins to the side in order to continue observing the four.

53	51		201							1	1081001																							
54	52		301							1	Kamui	Was someone running behind us?	1																					
55	53		202							1																								
56	54		301									Camu looks back, but the barren land is devoid of life.																						
57	55		201							1	500273

61	61		301							1	Chrome	That figure ran off to the west, right in the direction of our target.	2																					
62	62		202							1	2																							
63	63		201							1	500175																							
64	64		301							1	Camu	We also need to check for any signs of the Red Tide. Leave it to me.	1																					
65	65		201							1	500155																							
66	66		301							1	Chrome	The terrain here is too difficult to differentiate, Camu. We can split up after we reach our target.	1																					
67	67		201							1	500175																							
68	68		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Camu	Okay.	1																					
69	69		201							1	500100																							
70	70		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	α	That's not the Gray Ravens...	1																					
71	71		202							1					1																			
72	72		301									From the shadows, Alpha watches the four from a distance and sees them holding a detector. It seems they are looking for something in this barren land.																						
73	73		201							1	500100																							
74	74		301							1	α	...They've found the remnants of the Red Tide below.	1																					
75	75		202							1					1																			
76	76		301									The sewers below used to be abandoned before they were taken over by the Red Tide.																						
77	77		301									There was a simple reason for their abandonment—underground city 075 was spread out and the sewers fell into disrepair a long time ago, resulting in collapses every now and then.																						
78	78		301									Many places like this, where people do not usually visit, exist in underground city 075.																						
79	79		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					But to find Luna, Alpha has decided to search every nook and cranny.																						
80	80		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory275.png																								
81	81		504							0.7																								
82	82		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						When Longinus descends, Alpha has just concluded her investigation of the surface. With her newly obtained clues, she returns underground to recommence her search.																						
83	83		301									A violent shaking comes from the surface, and the intense heat can even be felt from the walls below.																						
84	84		201							1	500100																							
85	85		301							1	α	...	1																					
86	86		202							1					1																			
87	87		301									Although Alpha, who is trailing the Task Force, has anticipated what will happen, she cannot help grimacing when the tremors and searing heat hit.																						
88	88		301									Just as she plans to continue trailing them, she hears the sound of waves in the distance.																						
89	89		201							1	500100																							
90	90		301							1	α	Looks like the humans didn't manage to completely get rid of the Red Tide.	1																					
91	91		204							1	8																							
92	92		301									She listens carefully for the direction of the gushing red tide, and realizes that it only lasted a moment before being drowned out by the shaking earth.																						
93	93		204							1																								
94	94		301								α	The amount of Red Tide has decreased and it's coming from...	1																					
95	95		202							1					1																			
96	96		301									Figuring out that the sound is coming from unknown areas, Alpha quickly chases after it.																						
97	97		301									Just as she is about to arrive at the spot, she finds the way forward blocked by a thick stone wall.																						
98	98		201							1	500316																							
99	99		301							1	Roland?	Oh? Does it interest you?	1																					
100	100		301								Roland?	I've told you before that the only thing behind this wall is the abandoned sewers that might collapse at any moment, no different from an agent who has lost their strength.	1																					
101	101		202							1					1																			
102	102		301									Ignoring the noise in her M.I.N.D., Alpha conducts a quick search and finds a control panel to a secret door in the corner.																						
103	103		201							1	500100																							
104	2004		301							1	α	This area was recently submerged by the Red Tide and shouldn't have been discovered by the humans.	1																					
105	105		203							1	0.25	-450																						
106	106		201							2	500066		450																					
107	107		301							1	???	If the Red Tide has escaped to this place, it is likely that the agent and Gabriel are also here.	2																					
108	108		301								???	Who knows? Perhaps there might also be Ascendants under his command.	2																					
109	109		301								???	No matter how strong you are, you have no chance at taking on so many opponents at once.	2																					
110	110		301								α	If Vonnegut and Gabriel are in there, Luna might be there too.	1																					
111	111		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				α	Besides, unless there's a definite chance of victory, I'll avoid any battles with them.	1																					
112	112		202							1	2				1																			
113	3001		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory345.jpg																								
114	113		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The clamoring noise falls silent once more. Alpha pushes open the narrow secret door without hesitation and squeezes sideways into the sewers.																						
115	114		301									The red tide pools together on the uneven ground, and is now a watery liquid, a far cry from its previously viscous state. Even so, there is enough here to reach Alpha's ankles.																						
116	115		201							1	500100																							
117	116		301							1	α	As I thought.	1																					
118	117		301									Alpha continues her exploration in silence, and she is soon met by Hetero-Creatures she has never seen.																						
119	118		301								α	Are these...	1																					
120	119		301								α	Gabriel's creations?	1																					
121	120		203							1	0.25	-450																						
122	121		201							2	500314		450																					
123	122		301							1	??	Do you know Mr. Gabriel?	2																					
124	123		301									A young girl she has never seen appears in the shadows, asking Alpha with a soft voice.																						
125	124		301									Her breathing is weak and she is one with the Hetero-Creature around her. Alpha has not even sensed her presence.																						
126	125		301								α	Is he here?	1																					
127	126		301								??	Yes. It seems you're the person he mentioned.	2																					
128	127		301									The girl does not seem to hold any ill will toward her.																						
129	128		301								α	Who are you?	1																					
130	129		301								Cinderelik	I'm Mr. Vonnegut's subordinate. My name is Cinderelik.	2																					
131	130		202							1	2				1																			
132	131		301									What an unsurprising answer. Alpha walks toward the girl in the shadows to see her face more clearly.																						
133	132		201							1	500100		-450																					
134	133		201							2	500308		450																					
135	134		301							1	Cinderelik	Do you wish to destroy this place?	2																					
136	135		301								α	No, I have no interest in senseless destruction.	1																					
137	136		204							2	8																							
138	137		301								Cinderelik	Thank you.	2																					
139	138		204							2																								
140	139		301									She gave a slight bow to Alpha in greeting.																						
141	2006		301								Cinderelik	But we can't let the humans learn of this place yet.	2																					
142	2007		301								Cinderelik	I trust you. You're an Ascendant. I won't stand in your way.	2																					
143	2008		301							Cinderelik	But when you leave, I'll seal the exit.	2																						
144	2009		301								Cinderelik	This is the task Mr. Vonnegut has given me. I'm not to leave any entrances or exits open unless there are extraordinary circumstances. I beg your understanding.	2																					
145	2010		301								α	...As you wish.	1																					
146	140		301								α	If you're here, does that mean the agent is here too?	1																					
147	141		301								Cinderelik	No, Mr. Vonnegut only comes here when necessary.	2																					
148	142		301									Alpha appraises the girl in front of her, trying to figure out from her expression if she is lying.																						
149	143		301									But the girl's face remains unchanging and she could well be an answering machine. She does not reveal any additional information.																						
150	144		301									However, there seems to be an ember of insanity burning in the depths of her amber eyes, but it is hidden by a veneer of politeness, making it difficult to see.																						
151	145		301									Based on her experience, Alpha sees that there are similarities between this girl and Gabriel, but within this similarity are some essential differences.																						
152	146		301								α	What do you do here?	1																					
153	147		301								Cinderelik	Study.	2																					
154	148		301									Cinderelik is not lying. Neither has she changed the topic. Rather, she has chosen to tell a half-truth.																						
155	149		301								α	(Looks like she's the more troublesome type.)	1																					
156	150		301									She does not ask any more questions. She passes Cinderelik, preparing to head into the darkness.																						
157	151		301								Cinderelik	Where are you going?	2																					
158	152		301								α	To find someone.	1																					
159	153		301								Cinderelik	There are some places you cannot go.	2																					
160	154		301								α	And if I insist?	1																					
161	155		301									Cinderelik looks at Alpha without responding, but the answer has been made clear in the silence.																						
162	156		301								α	...	1																					
163	157		301									The goal now is to look for Luna. It is better to avoid unnecessary battles and find clues from places she can go.																						
164	158		301									But judging by her observation of Cinderelik's abilities, she would not have been a tough opponent.																						
165	159		301								α	(How about forcing my way through and continuing to investigate the forbidden area?)	1																					
166	160		202							1	2				1																			
167	161		301									Just as she was contemplating this, a figure leisurely sauntered over.																						
168	162		201							1	500100																							
169	163		301							1	α	Vonnegut?	1																					
170	164		201							1	500066																							
171	165		301							1	???	It's her.	1																					
172	166		202							1					1																			
173	167		301									The noise recognizes the figure and speaks calmly, as if the approaching figure were insignificant.																						
174	168		201							1	500100																							
175	169		301							1		Alpha turns around to see a female slowly turning the corner. She keeps looking around her.																						
176	170		301								???	Hello.																						
177	171		301									She sees Alpha in front of her and cheerfully greets her. In her hand is an unidentifiable iris.																						
178	172		301									Although Alpha does not sense any danger coming from her, she is still wary of the stranger.																						
179	173		301								???	I was careless and got lost. Do you know where the exit is?																						
180	174		301								α	Who are you? What are you doing here?	1																					
181	175		301								???	I was curious... and suddenly saw a narrow secret door over there.																						
182	176		301									Seeing that Alpha does not respond, she turns to look curiously at Cinderelik standing in the corner.																						
183	177		301								???	Did I interrupt your conversation?																						
184	178		301									Seeing that Alpha does not respond, she tilts her head to look at Cinderelik standing in the corner.																						
185	179		301									The mundanity and normalcy of the words have left Alpha unable to answer. She glances at Cinderelik, who also does not seem to understand what is going on.																						
186	180		301								α	Looks like you're not one of Vonnegut's Ascendants.	1																					
187	181		301								???	That's right. I'm like him, an agent called here by the glad tidings.																						
188	182		301								α	...!	1																					
189	183		301								???	But it seems he's taken care of everything here. There's nothing that requires my help.																						
190	184		301								α	An agent... What is your name?	1																					
191	185		301								???	Name? That's not an important piece of information.																						
192	186		301									She lowers her eyes and tucks the loose strands of hair behind her ears with her delicate fingers, smiling innocently.																						
193	187		301								???	People have given me many names, but the most common one is... "The Merciful One".																						
194	188		301								The Merciful One	If you require a name to call me by, you may call me that.																						
195	189		301								The Merciful One	If neither of you knows where the exit is, I'll continue with my search. I apologize for interrupting your conversation.																						
196	190		301								α	...	1																					
197	191		301									She waves at the two while holding the iris and saunters off.																						
198	192		301								α	(There is another agent here, so if I attack Cinderelik, it may attract her attention. I have greater priorities, so it's better to be cautious.)	1																					
199	193		202							1																								
200	194		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Alpha does not stay any longer. She turns around and disappears down the sewers without looking back.

203	197		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Alpha looks up from the flashback to see the squad having fun in the distance.																						
204	198		201							1	500100																							
205	199		301							1	α	...How carefree of them.	1																					
206	200		202							1					1																			
207	201		301									Absentmindedly, she recalls the memory fragments she saw in the M.I.N.D., memories from the other "her."																						
208	202		301									Constructs have the commandant's full respect, and the Gray Ravens are no longer just weapons for battle. In fact, there is even a sense of camaraderie between them.																						
209	203		301									If humans had aspired to peace and compassion like the Gray Ravens and the squad before her, perhaps this catastrophe would not have happened in the first place.																						
210	204		301									But those are purely hypothetical ideals. In reality, the Constructs are stuck in a quagmire and are forced to swallow the mud they are choking on.																						
211	205		301									Before they could even consider issues like equality and oppression, they had to first survive.																						
212	206		301									Those who pass the filtering understand that should a day come when the Punishing Virus is no longer a threat, the only beings left in this world will be Constructs.																						
213	207		201							1	500317		-450																					
214	208		201							2	500066		450																					
215	209		301							1	Luna?	But the humans who are still flesh and blood, with their deep-seated prejudice, aren't able to even pass the preliminary filtering process by the Punishing Virus.	1																					
216	210		301								???	That's why no one has ever mentioned one of the sources of human evil—arrogance.	2																					
217	211		202							1	2				1																			
218	212		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Alpha tightens her grip on her katana's hilt and tries to shut off the cacophony of noises that emerges successively in her M.I.N.D.																						
219	213		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Suddenly, Chrome receives an anonymous encrypted message on his terminal.

224	218		301								Wanshi	Who'd send a message like that?	3																					
225	219		301									Chrome examines the meta-data for any possible clues, but it has been scrubbed clean.																						
226	220		301								Chrome	There's no way to trace the sender. Our top priority is to find the Red Tide. There's no time to waste.	1																					
227	221		301								Wanshi	We may not be able to trace it, but I'm sure you have a pretty good idea who sent it.	3																					
228	222		301								Chrome	...	1																					
229	223		301									Chrome furrows his eyebrows thinking about the current state of 【kuroname】.																						
230	224		301									Although he has speculated that it might be someone who is looking for Luna, it would be foolish to probe for information this way.																						
231	225		301								Chrome	I think it's someone who is worried about Gray Raven.	1

237	231		201							2	500066		450																					
238	232		301							1	???	Are you worried about them?	2																					
239	233		301								α	They're fairly perfect "candidates" for Ascnet.	1

266	2014		301								Wanshi	I just wanted to help treat 【kuroname】. After all, I still owe the commandant.	3																					
267	2015		301								Wanshi	But it didn't take me long to realize it wasn't that simple.	3																					
268	2016		301								Wanshi	Gray Raven still doesn't know the whole story.	3																					
269	258		301								Wanshi	If they did, they would rather have their memories checked than let 【kuroname】 be charged.	3																					
270	259		301								Chrome	Therein lies the problem.	1																					
271	260		301								Chrome	Lucia, being closest to 【kuroname】 then, also lost consciousness toward the end. So there isn't any proof to exonerate 【kuroname】.	1																					
272	261		301								Chrome	Unless someone can find the target's whereabouts, they're going to be monitored indefinitely and prohibited from performing missions.	1

296	285		301								α	So that's why they weren't on this mission.	1																					
297	286		301								???	If 【kuroname】 knows what happened to Luna, Babylonia is using "monitoring" as a cover to protect the commandant.	2																					
298	287		301								α	If not...	1																					
299	288		301								???	Are you choosing to trust humans?	2

301	290		301								α	I just don't want to ignore a possibility.	1																					
302	291		301								α	If 【kuroname】 really doesn't know what happened to Luna and this was planned by the humans...	1																					
303	292		301								α	A commandant who can connect to agents will only endanger Ascendants and agents.	1																					
304	293		301								α	As long as 【kuroname】, "Lucia" and the Gray Ravens are loyal to Babylonia, Luna won't be safe from their future plans.	1																					
305	294		301								???	But when you questioned "Lucia" in the M.I.N.D., didn't you hold on to a faint hope that she could provide another possible path for Luna?	2																					
306	295		301								α	Hope... Heh, those words were just a reminder not to be so naive.	1																					
307	296		301								α	Whether or not she's ever thought about this is not an issue. She will never allow Luna to co-exist.	1																					
308	297		301								???	But you believe she will save Luna.	2																					
309	298		301								α	Because I know myself, and I'd never stand on the sidelines even if I didn't remember Luna.	1																					
310	299		301								α	At the very least, I'd try to make contact once.	1																					
311	300		301								α	Besides, Gray Raven's mission was to destroy the Polyphage. If they hadn't pulled Luna out, they wouldn't have been able to complete their mission.	1

320	309		301								α	If they return alive, Babylonia will know what's happening here.	1
