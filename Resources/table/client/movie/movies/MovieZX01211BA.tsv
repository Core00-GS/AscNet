11	10		301									The Construct holds up his shield, but it proves useless against Alpha. Her blade sifts through the air, and the very next instant, the Construct is already in two pieces.

17	16		301									The sight of their fallen comrades do not dishearten the Constructs, instead, it seems to be inspiring the others.																						
18	17		301									Heeding their leader's command, the Constructs quickly surround Alpha. This white-haired Ascendant is the target of their mission, and the Constructs are ready to do anything to defeat her.																						
19	18		301								Construct Leader	Go!	3																					
20	19	601	301									At their leader's cue, the Constructs ready their weapons for a concerted assault and close in on Alpha.

44	30		301			RImgBg1Shake						Not a single explosion—the cut has steered clear of the volatile core components of the Constructs. Their metallic frames groan before crumbling to the ground, and life becomes matter.

64	50		301								α	My own kind...? Interesting way to put it, Lucia.	1																					
65	51		301									Lucia inches toward Alpha cautiously, blade in hand. Alpha calmly smiles off this encroaching threat.																						
66	52		301								Lucia	Are they not? Those Constructs you cut down there, they were your comrades, our comrades! Why did you become like this?	2

79	65		301							1	Lucia	During the time in the arctics, I already knew that I wasn't the real me. And fighting with you again, I realized that...	3

81	67		301								α	Heh.	2
