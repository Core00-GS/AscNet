4	4		301									A streak of warm liquid flows down your cheek. With the buzz in your ears, you open your eyes to find the fading moonlight behind a cloudy night sky. The small building that trapped you is long gone.

8	8		301			DialogEnable						Hoping to take stock of your surroundings, you try to get up, only to find yourself pressed against by something heavy. Something that is dripping the liquid running down your face.																						
9	9		302								Is that... vital fluid?	10																						
10	10		301							1		Your vision trails downward, and you find Changyu's body lying on yours.																						
11	11		302								?!	12	Changyu!	12																				
12	12		201							1	500166																							
13	13		301							1	Lucia	Commandant!	1																					
14	1013		301									Hearing your voice, Lucia knocks out the remaining guard and hurries toward you with the rest of Gray Raven.																						
15	14		302								Is everyone alright?	15																						
16	15		301								Lucia	Everyone's fine. It's just a flashbang.	1																					
17	16		302								Is Changyu...	17																						
18	17		201							1	1031001																							
19	18		301							1	Liv	Diagnosing... His M.I.N.D. hasn't been damaged, and his body isn't critically wounded... The vital fluid he's bleeding is probably from injuries he took during the battle...	1																					
20	19		302								But he's not waking up—	20																						
21	20		201							1	500026																							
22	21		301							1	Lee	Hey, you! How long are you going to lie there?	1																					
23	22		301									Annoyed, Lee grabs Changyu by his collar and lifts him off his feet.																						
24	23		201							1	500225	6																						
25	24		301							1	Changyu	...Think of the children, Lee. Can't you just be a smidge gentler?	1																					
26	25		201							1	500026	10																						
27	26		301							1	Lee	Not for you.	1																					
28	27		202							1					1																			
29	28		301									Lee lets go of him, and Changyu lands—except he barely catches himself, no sign of the dexterous fighter he has been the whole night. Staggered, he leans on the broken wall next to him, rubbing his eyes clean of the vital fluid that seeped in.																						
30	29		201							1	500225	14																						
31	30		301							1	Changyu	A flashbang... I thought the wacko was bringing us down with him with an explosive.	1																					
32	31		302								Where's their boss, by the way?	32																						
33	32		201							1	500026																							
34	33		301							1	Lee	He escaped—thanks to a moron who smashed a hole in the wall for him before the flashbang went off.	1																					
35	34		201							1	500225	2																						
36	35		301							1	Changyu	C'mon, I couldn't have planned for everything, could I?	1																					
37	36		301								Changyu	Fussing over every detail's gonna give you wrinkles, Construct or not.	1																					
38	37		201							1	500026																							
39	38		301							1	Lee	That's not true!	1																					
40	39		202							1					1																			
41	40		301									You stand up to find all the mechanoid guards you fought now decimated.																						
42	41		302								Enemy status?	42																						
43	42		201							1	500026																							
44	43		301							1	Lee	We took care of the rest of them when you were both out. Not that there were many of them left—this doesn't seem to be their headquarters.	1

46	45		201							2	500225		400																					
47	46		301							1	Changyu	A temporary base of operation, then.	2																					
48	47		301								Lee	Enough with this. Care to explain what just happened?	1																					
49	48		204							2	6																							
50	49		301								Changyu	Oh. Well...	2																					
51	50		301									Changyu scratches his head, embarrassed.

54	53		204							2																								
55	54		301								Changyu	Sorry for keeping this from y'all.	2																					
56	55		301								Changyu	You were discovered the first time you set foot on the dock.	2																					
57	56		301								Changyu	These were some dirty, rich folks screwing around. They didn't think Babylonia would get involved.	2																					
58	57		301								Changyu	And when they realized that we knew each other, they came to me with an offer: remove the Babylonians, and they'll remove some of the more audacious terms on their deal with Akdilek.	2																					
59	58		301								Changyu	Audacious terms that I'd have to follow to get this—	2																					
60	59		301									He picks up the leather suitcase he threw aside and takes out an authenticator, carefully inspecting it.																						
61	60		301								Changyu	Phew... Everything's intact. Luckily I secured it when the guards came swinging.	2																					
62	61		302								You secured it during a fight like that?	62																						
63	62		301								Changyu	Well, it's important.	2																					
64	63		302								But you just threw it to the side...	64	You weren't protecting it during the explosion.	64																				
65	64		204							2	6																							
66	65		301								Changyu	Priorities, priorities...	2																					
67	66		301								Changyu	I told you I wanted a win-win situation... But if I have to lose one, I'd rather lose this.	2																					
68	67		301									He gives the authenticator in his hand a spin. Then he walks away and sits on a piece of rubble, mumbling to himself.																						
69	68		302								Why didn't you tell me the plan?	1068																						
70	1068		204							2	14																							
71	69		301								Changyu	Would you have said yes?	2																					
72	70		302								No.	71	Maybe.	72																				
73	71	73	301								Changyu	Duh! What do you think?	2																					
74	72		301								Changyu	Even if you agreed, your buddies here wouldn't!	2																					
75	73		202							2					1																			
76	74		201							1	500166																							
77	75		301							1	Lucia	What exactly was the plan?	1																					
78	76		302								Changyu was going to—	77	...	79																				
79	77		201							1	500225	3																						
80	78	81	301							1	Changyu	Look! You're here in one piece!	1																					
81	79		201							1	500225	2																						
82	80		301								Changyu	It doesn't matter, as long as 【kuroname】 is here in one piece.	1																					
83	81		302								But we've only discovered their scheme.	1083	But we haven't found those involved.	1083																				
84	1083		204							1	1																							
85	82		301								Changyu	I guess you're looking for this?	1																					
86	83		301									Changyu transfers you a data file.																						
87	84		301								Changyu	I just received this from Sophia. She managed to put together a list of names once she was done "cleaning." It should help you track them down, wherever they're hiding now.	1																					
88	85		302								So, all you're after is this device?	86																						
89	86		301								Changyu	Yep. Trades can resume once we get to quickly identify counterfeits with this thing.	1																					
90	87		302								You could've left me when you got it.	88																						
91	88		301								Changyu	Leave you? Have you forgotten the last thing I said?	1																					
92	89		301									Changyu raises three fingers, the way he did the day before.																						
93	90		204							1	2																							
94	91		301								Changyu	I told you I'd protect you, 【kuroname】, and I never go back on my word.	1																					
95	92		302								That doesn't sound like a good deal to you.	93																						
96	93		204							1	1																							
97	94		301								Changyu	Why? Because I didn't exploit everyone?	1																					
98	95		301								Changyu	Sure, I probably should've left sooner for Akdilek's sake.	1																					
99	96		301								Changyu	But I'm the agent on the scene, and I say you are more valuable than this device, so YOU are my priority.	1																					
100	97		301								Changyu	And I trust you. And I trust me. That's why it was always going to end in our favor.	1																					
101	98		302								Even though you thought it was a real bomb?	99																						
102	99		204							1	6																							
103	100		301								Changyu	Ugh... Sure.	1																					
104	101		204							1	2																							
105	102		301									Awkwardly he smiles, recalling how he was on the verge of a breakdown during the heat of the moment.																						
106	103		204							1	1																							
107	104		301								Changyu	Anyway, it's lovely how everything went so smoothly.	1																					
108	105		301								Changyu	I assume you're going after our escapee as well?	1																					
109	106		302								That's part of the job.	107	This data is more than enough.	107																				
110	107		301								Changyu	Then I guess it's fair to say we've killed two birds with one stone.	1																					
111	1108		204							1	13																							
112	108		301								Changyu	Wait, no—three birds with one stone...	1																					
113	109		302								Three birds?	110																						
114	110		204							1	6																							
115	111		301									Changyu's and your eyes meet, and he quickly looks away with a murmur.																						
116	112		301								Changyu	I've got everything I'm after, with a few benefits thrown in... Sounds like the best deal to me...	1																					
117	113		302								Hm?	114																						
118	114		204							1	2																							
119	115		301								Changyu	Nothing! Congratulations on a mission well executed! I'll take my leave now, see ya!	1																					
120	116		202							1					1																			
121	117		301									Changyu waves everyone goodbye, before hopping over the crumpled walls to a small, hidden path. But then he stops, and he turns around to look at you.																						
122	118		201							1	500225	1																						
123	119		301							1	Changyu	I'll see you soon, 【kuroname】.	1																					
124	120		301									He smiles at you and waves one last time, with a sincerity that you can perhaps recognize now.																						
125	121		301								Changyu	Next time I'll be an open book.	1																					
126	122		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					With that, Changyu dashes away through the ruins, leaping from one broken wall to another, looking almost lighter than he ever was, as he vanishes from your sight...
