7	7		301							1	Changyu	Excellent, it can surely pass the pre-selection. Come, this way.	1																					
8	8		301								Changyu	Just hand in your crafts, and you'll get the VIP tickets.	1																					
9	9		201							1	500127																							
10	10		301							1	Sophia	Time to watch the mechanic puppet show.	1																					
11	11		201							1	500166																							
12	12		301							1	Lucia	A show...	1																					
13	13		201							1	500145	1																						
14	14		301							1	Pulao	Wouldn't it be a pity if some art forms were only stored as data? It's the mission of Kowloong to recreate them in the real world.	1																					
15	15		301								Pulao	Besides, it can attract more guests this way. Pretty smart plan, right?	1																					
16	16		202								1																							
17	17		301									Led by the three, you and the others make your way to the pre-selection stage and exchange the crafts for VIP tickets.

21	20		301							1	Liv	Great, we've passed the pre-selection.	2																					
22	21		301								Pulao	I know you'll make it.	1																					
23	22		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The four of you put the tickets on the machine. The light curtain in the front melts, revealing a glittering stage.

27	24		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						A mechanical puppet is spinning a wooden wheel in the middle of the stage.																						
28	27		301							1	Pulao	Just in time, the show has just started.	1																					
29	28		301								Liv	What is that?	2																					
30	29		301								Pulao	A spinning wheel, which is used to spin threads according to the records in the data.	1																					
31	30		301								Pulao	In the past, people needed to use the spinning wheel to twist the materials into a string before weaving them into cloth.	1																					
32	31		202							1	2																							
33	32		301									The mechanical puppet who is spinning threads stands up with the music, and follows several similarly dressed mechanical puppets up the steps projecting the clouds. The surrounding scenery changes into a lake.																						
34	33		301									Gradually, people with different expressions gather around the stage. They all remain quiet while watching the mechanical puppets perform.																						
35	34		301									The spinning mechanical puppet falls in love with a shabby-looking puppet, but the two of them are forced to separate amidst a thunderstorm on the stage.																						
36	35		301									To get together again, the puppet slaughters a mechanical cow and tears off its cowhide. Having given up everything, he runs to the sky with his child.																						
37	36		201							1	1031001	14																						
38	37		301							1	Liv	Poor them... Why can't people who love each other be reunited, even in a story?	1																					
39	38		302								Because stories are based on reality.	39																						
40	39		301								Liv	Based on reality...	1																					
41	41		201							1	500143																							
42	42		301							1	Yazi	It's the same way in reality. People who love each other will always be separated.	1																					
43	43		301									Yazi has been standing behind everyone for some time.	1																					
44	44		301								Yazi	...The same happened to "Qu".	1																					
45	45		302								If there's a choice...	46																						
46	46		301								Yazi	Indeed. If they had a choice, they'd be standing here today.	1																					
47	47		301									Yazi turns back. Her mask is silent like a rock smoothed out by a river stream, hiding all emotions beneath it.																						
48	301		201							1	1031001																							
49	48		301							1	Liv	If there's a choice...	1																					
50	49		301									Liv recites the sentence silently, as if remembering something of the past that she does not want to recall.																						
51	50		301									The mechanical puppets on the stage are separated by the Milky Way amidst the sad music, creeping on the shore, trying to reach out to each other.																						
52	304		201							1	500143																							
53	51		301							1	Yazi	The story was set from the moment they were born as the cowherd and the weaving maid.	1																					
54	52		301								Yazi	They think they can change the future through their struggles, but the truth is that they've merely chosen the path that hurts the least.	1																					
55	53		301								Yazi	Or, the path that must be trodden, no matter the cost.	1																					
56	54		302								Are you talking about "Qu"?	55	Is this about you?	55																				
57	55		301									The floor of the stage turns into a bridge made of magpies in the projection. Upon such a touching scene, Yazi lets out a bitter smile.																						
58	56		301								Yazi	Is it important? They'll never be apart anymore, yet I'll always be here.	1																					
59	57		301									The mechanical puppets hug and cry on the magpie bridge. The audience under the stage bursts into applause. Eventually, some begin to stand up and leave.																						
60	58		302								Never be apart...?	59																						
61	59		301									Yazi does not answer your question. She simply joins the crowd of departing people.																						
62	302		201							1	1031001																							
63	60		301								Liv	Though the M.I.N.D. of "Qu" and Huaxu were damaged, they were also merged in such a way that's inseparable.	1																					
64	61		302								...	662																						
65	662		204							1	14																							
66	62		301								Liv	Is that freedom?	1																					
67	63		302								They made their choice.	64																						
68	64		301								Liv	Even if it means they have to end up like this?	1																					
69	65		302								Yeah.	66																						
70	66		301									Liv lowers her head thoughtfully.	1																					
71	67		302								What's on your mind?	68																						
72	68		301								Liv	It's nothing...	1																					
73	667		204							1	1																							
74	69		301									She looks up with a gentle, but enigmatic smile.	1																					
75	70		301								Liv	At least... not now. I can't tell you something uncertain.	1																					
76	71		202							1	2																							
77	72		201							1	500026																							
78	73		301							1	Lee	...?	1																					
79	74		201							1	1031001	1																						
80	75		302								Feel free to tell me...	76	Whenever you're ready.	76																				
81	76		301								Liv	Alright.	1																					
82	77		301									At this moment, a loud discussion breaks out.																						
83	78		201							1	500127																							
84	79		301							1	Sophia	The lucky draw is about to begin.	1																					
85	80		301									A projection screen rises in the middle of the stage, gradually revealing the list of prizes for this draw.																						
86	81		201							1	500166																							
87	82		301							1	Lucia	There are ten Lucky Prizes... the winners can choose any two pieces of crafts.	1																					
88	83		301								Crowds	Aren't those the crafts we handed over? What's the point?																						
89	84		301								Crowds	Because it's just the Lucky Prize, I guess.																						
90	85		201							1	1031001	1																						
91	86		301							1	Liv	The third prize seems to be the chance to shake hands with Miss Pulao.	1																					
92	87		201							1	500145	1																						
93	88		301							1	Pulao	Haha... It's just to... save money.	1																					
94	89		301								Crowds	That's the third prize?																						
95	90		301								Crowds	I'll have it if you don't want it. I'd love to meet the Kowloong Crew!																						
96	91		201							1	500026																							
97	92		301							1	Lee	The second prize is a collection of guqin pieces played by Yazi herself?	1																					
98	93		301								Crowds	Hey! Look at the first prize!																						
99	94		202							1																								
100	95		301									The first prize on the screen is, as Changyu originally said, a million grubs.																						
101	96		301								Crowds	That's miles different from the other prizes!																						
102	97		301								Crowds	It's the prize that drew me to make the craft!																						
103	98		301								Crowds	Please, let it be me. Come on, ticket, you're the hope I've been waiting for!																						
104	99		301									However, underneath the text "A Million Grubs" seems to be a small line of fine print.																						
105	100		302								"Only if certain conditions are met."	101	...?	101																				
106	101		201							1	500145																							
107	102		301							1	Pulao	Please... please don't be „Äêkuroname„Äë...	1																					
108	103		301									Pulao folds her hands, as if praying for something.																						
109	104		202							1																								
110	105		301									Afterward, the lotto numbers chosen by the ticket holders appear on the screen one after another, and the crowd falls silent.																						
111	106		301								System Notice	Announcing the winners of the ten Lucky Prizes!																						
112	107		301									With ten numbers appearing on the screen, murmurs arise in the crowd.																						
113	108		301								Crowds	Well, better than nothing.																						
114	109		301								Crowds	Let's go.																						
115	110		301									The winners of the third and second prizes are then revealed. None of the Gray Ravens' ticket numbers are shown on the screen.																						
116	111		302								...	112																						
117	112		201							1	500145																							
118	113		301							1	Pulao	...	1																					
119	114		301								System Notice	Announcing the winner of the first prize! Who is our lucky person going to be?																						
120	115		301									The projection screen flashes up in a dazzling light. After a burst of music, an unfamiliar number appears in the center.																						
121	116		201							1	1031001	6																						
122	117		301							1	Liv	It's not one of us...	1																					
123	118		201							1	500026																							
124	119		301							1	Lee	The odds are just too small based on the number of people participating in the lucky draw.	1																					
125	120		201							1	500166	1																						
126	121		301							1	Lucia	Better luck next time.	1																					
127	122		301									The crowd leaves in sighs. Changyu and Sophia stand up and wave at Pulao.																						
128	123		201							1	500124	1																						
129	124		301								Changyu	Good, now it's a sure bet.	1																					
130	125		301								Changyu	I'll leave the award ceremony to you. After all, you're the only one who can control it.	1																					
131	126		302								...?	127																						
132	127		201							1	500127																							
133	128		301								Sophia	Bye.	1																					
134	129		202							1																								
135	130		201							1	500145	1																						
136	131		301							1		After the two leave, Pulao sighs in relief and steps onto the stage to greet the winning craftsman.																						
137	132		301								Pulao	...Let's congratulate our lucky winner.	1																					
138	133		301									Slightly nervous, she welcomes the winner onto the stage.																						
139	134		301								Pulao	Please welcome the presenters...	1																					
140	135		301									Several heavily armored mechanical guards step on the stage.																						
141	136		301								Pulao	Now, a million grubs will be yours after you defeat them.	1																					
142	137		301								Winner	What's that about? I've never heard of such a requirement!																						
143	138		301								Pulao	Y-you just didn't pay attention, you see?	1																					
144	139		301								Pulao	Look, it clearly says here that "Only if certain conditions are met"!	1																					
145	140		301								Winner	Who would notice the fine print! You scammers!																						
146	141		301								Winner	Nobody can survive fighting that many mechanical guards! Keep your prize!																						
147	142		301									He stomps off the stage in a fury, throwing the ticket away and leaving the place.																						
148	143		302								(Pick up the ticket)	1444																						
149	1444		204							1																								
150	144		301								Pulao	?!	1																					
151	145		302								Ah, jackpot.	146																						
152	146		301								Pulao	No, no, noooo, it's not yours.	1																					
153	147		302								It is now.	148																						
154	148		301								Pulao	What are you...?! Next time... I'll apply a real-name system!	1																					
155	149		302								Now, let's go claim the prize.	150																						
156	150		201							1	500166	1
