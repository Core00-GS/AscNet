26	26		301									An unfamiliar face blocks his vision. As the face pulls back, he finally catches a glimpse of the person before him—a young girl in a silver pilot suit is staring at him, her hands on her hips.																						
27	27		301									His memory data paused when his power was first cut. He soon realizes that the girl was the one who rebooted him.																						
28	28		301									The overly friendly girl wipes away the snow above him, circling him as if having discovered some treasure.

30	30		301								??	You're welcome, by the way! I always aim to help those in need! What should I call you, Snipey?	1																					
31	31		301									As she talks unprompted, Sniper-PK43 runs his self-diagnose program and finds everything functioning normally. However, unable to connect to the internet, he has no idea how long it has been since he was shut down.																						
32	32		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
33	33		301							1	Sniper	I am a fully automated sniping platform, model Sniper-PK43. You show no sign of infection. What is your purpose?	1

35	35		301							1	??	Hm, you can call me Master Nanami, the Chosen One!	1																					
36	36		301								Nanami	Nanami walked umpteen days before I found you, Snipey! You might sound like a weird middle-aged man, but you're the first person I can talk to, so I won't mind.	1

45	45		301								Nanami	I want to be your friend, though. I've traveled a long way, and I've seen nothing but snow without a single soul in sight. Nanami's so bored...	1

47	47		401							2	968																							
48	48		301									Sniper-PK43 pauses after hearing what Nanami says. For a second, there is only the sound of the howling wind on the small roof where they are.																						
49	49		301									Looking down from this height, he finds the swirling snow blocking the sky, concealing everything further than five meters away. All he can see is the vague shape of the city not far from here, buried in the snowstorm.																						
50	50		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
51	51		301							1	Sniper	Not much has changed since I was shut down.	1

57	57		301									...What happened?																						
58	58		301									As Sniper-PK43 contemplates, the girl extends her hand and gently touches the back of his head. Surprisingly, none of Sniper-PK43's programs find Nanami hostile.																						
59	59		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					And this familiar motion has jolted his memory.																						
60	60		402							968

62	62		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						He has no idea when the snow started.																						
63	63		401							1	120																							
64	64		301									The building he is in belongs to a conservation area, and he belongs to a human soldier.																						
65	65		301									The soldier is from Babylonia, so he is technically a Babylonia property as well. He is booted up for the first time on this very roof.																						
66	66		201							1	500197																							
67	67		301							1	??	Aha, it's on... That's fantastic. I thought you were irreparable...	1																					
68	68		401							2	1509																							
69	69		301									As his systems slowly activate and run, he finds himself being able to hear, then see.																						
70	70		301									He sees the soldier's hand on his head, patting him like a small animal.

72	72		301							1	Sniper	M-T-0-8. Activation complete. Please—issue command—	1

75	75		301							1	Soldier	Did you get that model number from the Sheriff series chip...? Regardless, it's great that you're running. It'll ease everyone's burden for a little bit.	1																					
76	76		301									The soldier mumbles to himself and retracts his hand, exhaling in the cold wind, his breath clearly visible. He puts on his thick gloves again.																						
77	77		301								Soldier	We'll call you Sniper, yeah? (Exhales) Starting today, you and I are gonna keep our eyes on this area. Your job is to take down any Corrupted that cross this border, understood?	1																					
78	78		202							1					1

81	81		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Afterward, he replaces the soldier to keep watch on the roof, his duty non-stop.																						
82	82		301									Occasionally, the soldier will come up to perform maintenance on Sniper-PK43 while he talks to himself on topics unrelated to work.																						
83	83		301									He talks about Babylonia, a base in the sky where a senior he respects lives; how there used to be four seasons, but only winter remains; how there are fewer Corrupted now, probably since the Ever-Winter is spreading faster...

87	87		301							1	Soldier	Can you see the Badlands, Sniper?	1																					
88	88		301									The soldier, sitting next to Sniper, points toward the distance in the night. His voice is trembling despite the bulky protection suit he is wearing.																						
89	89		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
90	90		301							1	Sniper	I do not understand what "Badlands" means.	1																					
91	91		301									All Sniper-PK43 sees through the snowstorm is a city frozen in ice.																						
92	92		201							1	500197																							
93	93		301							1	Soldier	Haha, touche... It was quite a disaster, wasn't it? Any place that can offer a view of the Badlands is probably part of the Badlands now.	1																					
94	94		202							1					1																			
95	95		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Badlands, "Ever-Winter", "war," and "seasons"... none of these concepts exist in Sniper-PK43's database. He can only piece together this fading story through snippets of the soldier's words.

98	98		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Later, there is no more enemy apart from a few Corrupted that wander beyond the conservation area. His duty with the soldier grows laxer as if they are the only ones left in the world, and the world is but this roof.																						
99	99		301									The soldier disappears for a while. Sniper-PK43 still holds his position—without a new command, this is the only thing he can do.																						
100	100		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStorySnowNew.prefab	1																							
101	101		401							2	968																							
102	102		301									It is once again nighttime when the soldier shows up. He climbs to the roof, the highest point of the city, panting and sitting next to Sniper.																						
103	103		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
104	104		301							1	Sniper	Do you have a new command?	1																					
105	105		201							1	500154																							
106	106		301							1	Soldier	...What? Why?	1																					
107	107		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
108	108		301							1	Sniper	You disappeared. I thought I would never see you again.	1																					
109	109		202							1					1																			
110	110		301									The soldier laughs. He spends some effort to remove his helmet and gloves before Sniper-PK43, exposing his face in the blizzard.																						
111	111		301									His skin begins to turn purple from the extreme cold. This is the first time Sniper-PK43 sees his face.																						
112	112		201							1	500154																							
113	113		301							1	Soldier	I'm sorry I left you here for so long.	1																					
114	114		301									Sniper-PK43 notices that the vapor on the soldier's face is slowly turning into a thin layer of frost.																						
115	115		301								Soldier	I'm sorry... that I showed you the worst this world has offered.	1																					
116	116		301									Despite him talking to Sniper-PK43, his gaze lands somewhere in the distance. Sniper-PK43 wonders if he is actually talking to someone else behind.																						
117	117		301									The soldier stands up and pats Sniper-PK43 with his gloveless hand like the first time. Sniper-PK43 perceptively notices his irregular heartbeats and that he is shaking.																						
118	118		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
119	119		301							1	Sniper	Did something happen? I can offer nighttime counseling if you need someone to talk to.	1																					
120	120		301									Surprisingly, the soldier does not laugh at Sniper-PK43's "joke." He just keeps on patting, whispering.																						
121	121		201							1	500154																							
122	122		301							1	Soldier	My senior is gone as well... None of us can hold on any longer. We'll probably abandon this place soon.	1																					
123	123		301								Soldier	What a shame...	1																					
124	124		301									The soldier places his hand on Sniper-PK43's power button.																						
125	125		301								Soldier	...I can't keep showing you all this despair...	1																					
126	126		201							1	500470			-350	600

132	132		301							1	Soldier	Goodbye, Sniper. Thank you for being by my side...	1																					
133	133		401							2	901																							
134	134		301									As the light on his power cable flickers, the blue lights of the hundreds of nodes on his body begin to dim. He is about to become a pile of useless parts.																						
135	135		202							1																								
136	136		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The last thing he sees before his system shuts down is the soldier, facing away from him, standing under the crescent, crimson moon in the storm and, like an arctic bird, jumping off the roof.

141	141		301									When Sniper-PK43 was rebooted, this was where his fragmented memories stopped.																						
142	142		201							1	500472																							
143	143		301							1	Nanami	So you don't know why either?	1																					
144	144		301									Nanami mutters to herself. That is when Sniper-PK43 realizes that she has just accessed his memories.																						
145	145		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
146	146		301							1	Sniper	Who are you exactly?	1

148	148		301							1	Nanami	Nanami is Nanami, duh.	1																					
149	149		301									Sniper-PK43 recognizes that the girl before him is no human, but he cannot deduce her true identity either. Before he can make any judgment, she continues the conversation.																						
150	150		201							1	500472	14																						
151	151		301							1	Nanami	But the place I came from looks nothing like this... I've never seen a blizzard this huge! Not even in the ARU! I've been building snowmen on the way, and I'm bored! There's no one to have a snowball fight with me!	1																					
152	152		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
153	153		301							1	Sniper	Where did you come from?	1																					
154	154		201							1	500472																							
155	155		301							1	Nanami	I can't tell for sure. I was traveling around the globe before mecha babushka sent me here.	1																					
156	156		204							1	1																							
157	157		301								Nanami	Anyway, you don't seem to have any clue either... In that case, Nanami's moving on to the next destination. Do you want to join me, Snipey?	1																					
158	158		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
159	159		301								Sniper	Where is the next destination?	1

161	161		301							1	Nanami	Nanami has no idea!	1																					
162	162		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
163	163		301							1	Sniper	How are you expecting to convince me? I am not going anywhere. My mission is to station here. My maker gave me that command.	1																					
164	164		201							1	500472	1																						
165	165		301							1	Nanami	Nanami knows that you're hoping to see your maker, aren't you? Let's set our temporary co-op objective to finding your maker! With the two of us, I'm certain we can figure out where everyone went!	1																					
166	166		301									Nanami's voice is as light as a hummingbird, and the hope within her seems to have stirred up Sniper-PK43's static programming.																						
167	167		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
168	168		301							1	Sniper	...Are you going to look for humans?	1

171	171		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
172	172		301							1	Sniper	I recommend abandoning your objective. I have been here for a very long time, and I have not seen a single human.	1																					
173	173		201							1	500472																							
174	174		301							1	Nanami	How long is "very long"?	1

176	176		301							1	Sniper	Just... very, very long...	1																					
177	177		301								Sniper	But he wanted me to stay here to guard this city.	1																					
178	178		301									...None of us can hold on any longer. We'll probably abandon this place soon.																						
179	179		301									The soldier's words have Sniper-PK43 feeling a little hesitant.																						
180	180		301								Sniper	...And why would you do that for me anyway?	1																					
181	181		201							1	500473

194	194		301									Hearing that, Nanami opens her arms and jumps toward Sniper-PK43, her face sticking right next to his barrel.
