90	105		301									During countless helpless nights, she has let silent tears burn her wounds and pain, giving her motivation to work harder to build a better tomorrow.

95	110		301									Despite not having wounds, Lucia tightly clenches her blade among the crowd.																						
96	111		301									Even Lee, a Construct of few words, has become even more reticent. Aside from discussing rescues and missions, he remains silent for most of the day.																						
97	112		301									...																						
98	113		301									With the birth of the twins and the impact of the Hetero-Hive Mother, Gray Raven has been unable to move about freely.

273	288		301								Liv	...I heard that from the refugees that just arrived. What happened?	1																					
274	289		301								Lucia	Some Hetero-Creatures learned to attack as a group and began attacking where people gathered.	2																					
275	290		301								Lucia	We stayed there for a whole day before we could get rid of all the Hetero-Creatures.	2																					
276	291		301								Lucia	Parts of the conservation area were damaged, leaving only one Construct to repair the CPF and evacuate the refugees gathering there.	2

281	296		301								Lee	Now there are more people gathered in this conservation area than in any other place, which poses an issue for evacuation.	2																					
282	297		301								Lee	There are few targets left that can be destroyed traveling north along the west coast.	2

288	303		301									At first, the team stayed on the surface to help those in the same situation while also giving the commandant some time to heal.																						
289	304		301									They believed that there was still a ray of life in the dark depths. They believed the enemy could be defeated, that people would survive, and that the commandant would return to the team.

351	366		301								Liv	...Of course.

436	452		301								Chuck	See? What'd I say?!																						
437	453		301								Chuck	Playing music might not fix anything, but getting your feelings off your chest is better than holding them in.

440	456		301								Liv	What's wrong?																						
441	457		301								Old Lady	He's fine. An old man like him... He's probably just thinking about the past.																						
442	458		301								Old Lady	As people get older, some things become more clear, regardless of the song or a sack of rice...																						
443	459		301									She shivers and lights a precious rolled cigarette as her eyes sink into memories.																						
444	460		301								Old Lady	During the Golden Age, livestock and farmland were run by machines. After the meltdown of the zero-point reactor, food sources were cut off.																						
445	461		301								Old Lady	After such a long time, it was difficult for people to take up farming and raising livestock, but some people managed to do it.																						
446	462		301								Old Lady	Not many people were able to while also fighting the Corrupted. People talked about taking seeds back to find safe places to plant crops.																						
447	463		301								Old Lady	But once there weren't any Corrupted, people desperate for food came to seize all of our hard work.																						
448	464		301									She raises her hardened gaze and looks around at the refugees sitting in the basement.																						
449	465		301								Old Lady	Just like the great winter famine in the historical records, there was no stable yield of food for a long time. People could only take what they could get their hands on.																						
450	466		301								Old Lady	Without livestock or produce, we resorted to eating birds and mice.																						
451	467		301								Old Lady	People even scavenged in areas with hordes of Corrupted, but few returned.																						
452	468		301								Old Lady	So people began to breed something that they could raise quickly and that others hated.																						
453	469		301									She takes out the half-remaining rolled cigarette and draws something about four centimeters in length with her hands. She doesn't say what it was, but everyone understands what she meant.																						
454	470		301								Old Lady	But there wasn't much left to feed those pesky insects, so they couldn't raise enough to be made into protein blocks like the movies in the Golden Age.																						
455	471		301								Old Lady	And, normally, people wouldn't have touched them. But worst came to worst, even those were taken.																						
456	472		301								Old Lady	If this went unchecked, we would've filled our stomachs with everything and there wouldn't be anything left. So rules were made and spread through word of mouth...																						
457	473		301								Old Lady	Seeds must be left behind. Offspring and fish eggs are not to be eaten. Plant roots must remain in the soil. Pregnant animals and their food are not to be disturbed unless there is an emergency.																						
458	474		301								Old Lady	Once people began to abide by these rules, we noticed some improvement. Animals could be seen in the mountains and forests, and seedlings sprout in areas that were harvested.																						
459	475		301								Old Lady	It helped us get through our darkest time. The old folks who lived through that era still remember it.																						
460	476		301								Old Lady	But the disaster didn't spare us. It only got worse every day... Sometimes people break the rules when they can longer take the hunger.																						
461	477		301								Old Lady	And once the rules are broken, those that suffer have no choice but to do the same.																						
462	478		301								Old Lady	That's when we met "Cheese", heh... We didn't know his real name, but that's what he was eating when we saw him. Cheese was so rare at the time, that's what we decided to call him.																						
463	479		301									She takes a deep drag of her cigarette. Ash rolls down her fingers, but she doesn't seem to mind. She just sighs in the thick cloud of smoke.																						
464	480		301								Old Lady	...Nothing I'm proud of.																						
465	481		301								Old Lady	We thought he was well off seeing him eat cheese next to a field he lived by.																						
466	482		301								Old Lady	That old geezer snuck into his field to steal food for us to eat, but didn't leave him any seeds. Cheese and his wife barely made it through the winter, but the baby in her belly didn't make it.																						
467	483		301								Old Lady	The first time we heard this song was when he was kneeling in his empty field... holding his wife who had fainted from crying as he sang to her.																						
468	484		301								Old Lady	We didn't have the heart to go up and confess what we had done. We sent him some supplies, but they moved away shortly after.																						
469	485		301								Old Lady	Since then, we've had the habit of leaving seeds for everything we eat. Even if no one cares about this rule, we can't break it ourselves.																						
470	486		301								Old Lady	Even though the conservation areas have already been built, there's still room to raise crops and livestock there.																						
471	487		301								Old Lady	But as you all have seen, this stuff won't last very many days if anything bad happens.																						
472	488		301									She shakes her head, then snuffs out her cigarette.																						
473	489		301								Old Lady	Well, enough of me rambling out these trifles of the past. The porridge should be ready now. Let's dig in.																						
474	490		301								Refugee Child	Yeah!																						
475	491		301									The refugees who already become too preoccupied with thoughts of the long-awaited porridge to listen to her story suddenly spring to life.																						
476	492		301									Surprised by excitement, the Constructs resting in the nearby room walk out.																						
477	493		301								Construct Soldier	Let's start serving everyone.																						
478	494		301								Liv	Sure.																						
479	495		301								Construct Soldier	Everyone, form a line. No need to push and shove.																						
480	496		301								Refugee Child	Got it!																						
481	497		301									Everyone grabs a spoon and lines up, holding their own tableware containers enthusiastically, paying extra attention that they receive their fair share.																						
482	498		301									Jin holds the porridge carefully, salutes the Construct Soldiers and Liv, then returns to Lindsey's bed.																						
483	499		301									Old Cali, having not eaten for three days, takes a bite out of his wife's porridge under her persuasion.																						
484	500		301									Stanley, Shrek, Fantine... Everyone except for the wounded who are still unconscious gets a bowl of warm porridge.																						
485	501		301									The heat from the bowl in their hands warms their spirit as people sit down and enjoy this rare delicacy.																						
486	502		301								Lucia	Liv...																						
487	503		301									While the crowd is distracted by their meal, Lucia calls Liv aside in a low voice.																						
488	504		301								Liv	Yes?																						
489	505		301								Lucia	Come with me.																						
490	506		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	...
