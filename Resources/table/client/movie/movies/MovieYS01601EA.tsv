16	16		301							1	???	It's probably not a bad thing. After all, emotions are subtle, and often have multiple forms.	1																					
17	17		302								Who?	18	...Memory?	18																				
18	18		301								Guinevere	Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Guinevere. Those rude guests woke me up.	1

20	20		301							1	Lee	...Already corrupted?	1																					
21	21		201							1	500073																							
22	22		301							1	Guinevere	Who knows? Changes always take place in silence, just like the emergence of emotions.	1																					
23	23		302								Lee, please test her immediately.	24	Is that so?	24																				
24	24		301								Guinevere	Well, that's a lie. A knock on the door was just the beginning, they hadn't had a chance to touch me yet.	1																					
25	25		201							1	1011001																							
26	26		301							1	Lee	...	1																					
27	27		302								Test her as usual.	28	It's a routine.	28																				
28	28		301								Lee	I see. I'll check her integrity now.	1																					
29	29		201							1	500073																							
30	30		301							1	Guinevere	So I'm guessing you're their king, right?	1																					
31	31		302								Not the king...	32	I'm their commandant.	32																				
32	32		301								Guinevere	So you deny it? You're cute. I'm the one who could see the threads of fate.	1																					
33	33		301								Guinevere	The threads of fate and those of emotions firmly linked to each other are intertwined in you.	1																					
34	34		301								Guinevere	... which makes you a beloved king.	1																					
35	35		301								Guinevere	I guess you also love your people, right, my king?	1																					
36	36		302								I said I'm not...	38	...Yeah I am.	37																				
37	37	43	301								Guinevere	Your frankness seems familiar to me. Perhaps I'm in love with you as well.	1

39	39		301							1	Liv	...Aren't you, Commandant?	1																					
40	40		201							1	500073																							
41	41		301							1	Guinevere	Don't be shy about admitting love, my king. Or should I say, the not-so-frank commandant?	1																					
42	42		301								Guinevere	But perhaps I'm in love with you after all.	1																					
43	43		201							1	1031001	7																						
44	44		301							1	Liv	...Is that love?	1																					
45	45		201							1	500073																							
46	46		301							1	Guinevere	Sure it is.	1																					
47	47		301								Guinevere	Whether it's love or the emotions that include it, are all complicated and contradictory.	1																					
48	48		301								Guinevere	Like the two over there...	1
