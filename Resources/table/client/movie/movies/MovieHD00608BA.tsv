3	3		301			DialogEnable						Following Embla's footsteps, you proceed deeper into the underground city to continue your investigation.																						
4	4		301									When Lucia and Liv try to piece together the disarray tracks in front of them to form an estimated route, Lee calls you aside...

6	6		301							1	Lee	Commandant.	1																					
7	7		302								What is it?	8																						
8	8		301								Lee	I have been thinking... Is the state exhibited by Embla and Askr really just the result of self-evolution?	1																					
9	9		302								Why?	10																						
10	10		301								Lee	Without any bionic necessity, mechanoids are only implemented with service-oriented AI. In other words, they are only programmed to serve specific tasks.	1																					
11	11		301								Lee	Even if this simple command evolves, it shouldn't result in a mechanoid developing sentience, let alone imitating human relationships.	1																					
12	12		302								...	13																						
13	13		301								Lee	So... I was thinking. Perhaps...	1

15	15		301							1	Lucia	We've found signs of Embla. Let's get going.	1																					
16	16		302								...Yeah.	17

18	18		301									At first, Embla's footprints are sporadic and staggered. But further on, Embla appears more light on her feet.

22	22		301							1	Lucia	What's going on? Her pace has quickened and become more agile...	1																					
23	23		301								Lee	That's definitely not a part of her design... It can't even be the result of self-evolution...	2																					
24	24		301								Liv	If she continues at this level of motion intensity... The structural strength of her mechanoid frame might not last much longer.	3																					
25	25		302								...Is she being reckless?	26																						
26	26		301								Lucia	...Seems like the only possibility.	1																					
27	27		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				We need to stop her before it's too late.	28

30	30		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Chasing behind Embla, the cityscape gradually disappears behind you.																						
31	31		301									A plaza-esque area appears before you...																						
32	32		301									...																						
33	33		301									Embla's tracks are starting to fade. You only have a vague sense of where she is going.																						
34	34		301									Instead, your vision is filled with scattered mechanical limbs and the interspersed fights between mechanoids.																						
35	35		201							1	500029																							
36	36		301							1	Lucia	Looks like she continued forward.	1

38	38		301							1	Lee	Well then, let's keep going.	1
