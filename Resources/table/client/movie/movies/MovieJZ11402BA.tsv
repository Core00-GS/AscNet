11	12		301									Hearing this, Pfaff realizes that the bionic tide is coming today.

16	17		202							1	2																							
17	18		301									Quickly paying the knife seller, Pfaff turns and hurries into the forest.

22	23		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Pfaff	Rosetta! Are you here?!	1																					
23	24		301									Pfaff shoves open the small door to the cabin. There are no signs of invasion by the tide, but Rosetta is nowhere to be found.																						
24	25		301									Pfaff has previously ordered Rosetta to leave a note whenever she would leave home.																						
25	26		301								Pfaff	If only I hadn't gone out at this time... Rosetta... Where in God's name are you?	1																					
26	27		301									His intuition tells him that Rosetta's disappearance must be related to the bionic tide.																						
27	28		301									And as if confirming Pfaff's thoughts, the characteristic roars of the bionics resound from outside the door.

41	40		301							1		The tide, however, is more than just a singular bionic. More begin to surround Pfaff.	1	2																				
42	41		301								???	(Whistles)																						
43	42		301									A short whistle travels through the air, and over a dozen spears plummet from the sky, impaling the bionics that surrounded Pfaff.																						
44	4201		202							1	2																							
45	43		301									Crisp clip-clops of hooves approach. A centaur-shaped Construct leaps over the bushes and stands beside Pfaff.																						
46	44		201							1	500205	1																						
47	45		301							1	Temia	My name is Temia, a member of the Forest Guard. Are you injured, sir?	1																					
48	46		301									Seeing this strange Construct introduce herself as a Forest Guard, Pfaff furrows his brows and shifts, quietly avoiding eye contact.																						
49	47		301									Taking Pfaff's silence for shock, Temia strides over to comfort him. Before reaching Pfaff, however, a bionic—not completely destroyed—suddenly hurls itself at her.

53	51		401							2	1510																							
54	52		301									A blast from Pfaff's shotgun punches a hole straight through the bionic's chest. Smoke dissipates from the barrel.																						
55	53		201							1	500200																							
56	54		301							1	Pfaff	If you don't destroy their power connectors, they might get back up again. 	1

64	62		301								Temia	To the mountains where the kids in town snuck off to...? But why?	1																					
65	63		301								Forest Guard	There are quite a few bionic footprints nearby. I'm worried that...	2																					
66	64		301									Hearing the Forest Guard, Pfaff immediately slings his shotgun around his shoulder and hastily proceeds toward the mountain.																						
67	65		301								Forest Guard	Hey, where are you going?! Hey!	2

78	77		301								Rosetta	But now there are only two choices: charge ahead of the bionics to find the girls, or...	1
