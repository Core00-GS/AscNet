13	13		301							1	Staessen	This is the Gray Raven Commandant. We were finally able to bring closure to Derek and Amberia thanks to this person.	1

15	16		301							1	Antonov	...Oh! You're "the" commandant?	1

19	20		301							1	Sergey	First of all, the Commune wants a secure place to live. The two icebreakers are our only hope of survival. However, they also limit our population.	1																					
20	21		201							1	500214																							
21	22		301							1	Rosetta	The Forest Guards are willing to accept absolution and move to a new settlement, provided that the interests of others are not harmed.	1

23	24		301							1	Antonov	Wait... We might have something on our hands here!	1

26	27		201							1	500087																							
27	28		301							1	Sergey	So, if the Forest Guards are willing to clear safe passage for a land-based supply route, the Commune can sail the ships to New Murmansk without worries.	1																					
28	29		201							1	500214																							
29	30		301							1	Rosetta	Once we resupply at New Murmansk, the Commune and Forest Guards will set out toward the new settlement.	1																					
30	31		201							1	500199		1																					
31	32		301							1	Staessen	And with a new transportation line established, the ARU can also establish contact with you. The new environment will be far more hospitable than where you live now!	1
