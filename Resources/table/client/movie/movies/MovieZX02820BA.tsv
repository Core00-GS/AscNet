14	14		301									Karenina dodges the white monster's fast leap strike and shoots at it. She uses the cannon's recoil to quickly move away, avoiding the follow-up claw attacks.																						
15	15		301								Teddy	Hey... What are you fighting against?																						
16	16		301								Karenina	A monster... made from the zero-point engine and... um, white pieces of flesh?	1																					
17	17		301								Teddy	I must be an idiot to hope that you can explain things clearly with that extremely poor expression of yours...

24	24		301									The frenzied monster shatters the rocks on the ground, sending the gravel and lunar soil flying toward Karenina. Karenina has seen them coming, so she leaps high above and prepares to attack the monster's head—which happens to be the zero-point engine.

35	35		301									Karenina fired her cannon in advance to shoot all the rocks down. If she didn't do so, even if she gets lucky and doesn't get injured, the kinetic energy from the rocks will still blow her away.																						
36	36		301								Teddy	Hello... Karenina?																						
37	37		204							1	4																							
38	38		301								Karenina	I'm fine... But...	1																					
39	39		301									Aerial attacks don't seem to work on this monster. To reach the zero-point engine on its head, she must limit its action by hitting its weak points.																						
40	40		301									But how can she limit the action of a monster that can repair itself infinitely...?																						
41	41		204							1	5																							
42	42		301								Karenina	Well, I better not think too much. If destroying it once isn't enough, I'll do it twice! Or even three times!	1																					
43	43		301								Teddy	Hmph... Only you can think of such a stupid idea. But I guess it's the best strategy for you.

53	53		301									Karenina once again charges at the pale monster. She jumps above and slams her Blast Hammer down, knocking up lunar soil to block its vision.																						
54	54		301									Still, the monster is intelligent enough to unleash wide-range gravitational waves that blow away the lunar soil instantly. Even if Karenina jumps up, she will be pulled down.

66	66		301			RImgBg1Shake						Screaming, running, Karenina throws herself toward the gravitational waves emitted by the monster and neutralizes part of them with the gravity control system of her own frame.																						
67	67		301									Karenina knew the wide-range waves wouldn't have as much strength, so she chose to break through from the front.

71	71		301									The monster has no time to react. It can only watch Karenina's Blast Hammer approach as its engine makes a loud hum.

82	82		301			RImgBg1Shake				1		The monster's right leg is immediately severed from its body and falls to the ground. Still, it manages to swing its claw to hold Karenina off.

84	84		301							1	Karenina	****! It's got good reflexes...	1

86	86		301							1		The gravitational waves keep Karenina at bay. She can only watch the monster recover.																						
87	87		301			RImgBg1Shake						However, no matter how hard the monster trembles, its right leg does not seem to be growing back.																						
88	88		201							1	500494	4																						
89	89		301							1	Karenina	Wait... It can't regenerate fast like before...	1																					
90	90		301								Teddy	Yeah, we're also investigating this. It could be due to a change in the zero-point energy supply. Some of the energy is allocated to a strange place... It's going to the Omega Weapon where that agent is located.																						
91	91		301								Teddy	What makes it more strange is that the Corrupted who kept attacking us suddenly weakened a lot...																						
92	92		301									Karenina looks in the direction of the Construct lab as she mumbles to herself.																						
93	93		301								Karenina	So... She chose to live on in the end...	1																					
94	94		202							1					1																			
95	95		301									The pale mutant's right leg has slowly grown back, but instead of attacking back, it runs to the center of the battlefield in order to absorb more remotely transmitted zero-point energy.																						
96	96		301								Teddy	Karenina, the gravitational waves will reach the critical point in 12 minutes and 21 seconds! You must hurry...
