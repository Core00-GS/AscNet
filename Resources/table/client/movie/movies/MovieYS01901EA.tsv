7	7		302								What's the matter, Lucia?	8	Is it almost over?	9																				
8	8		301								Lucia	Nothing, Commandant. I was just thinking that the battle was coming to an end.	1

10	10		301							1	Liv	I just... start to feel a bit lonely...	1																					
11	11		201							1	1011001																							
12	12		301							1	Lee	I'm not going to take back my comment of "not like a real hero story," but it's not a bad one either.	1																					
13	13		302								I feel the same.	14	Guys...	14																				
14	14		201							1	1021001																							
15	15		301							1	Lucia	It's a bit weird. We weren't supposed to have so many feelings about our missions.	1																					
16	16		204							1	3																							
17	17		301								Lucia	Perhaps they are too detached from reality.	1																					
18	18		301								Lucia	It's another ideal that doesn't belong to our time, real and illusory at the same time.	1																					
19	19		201							1	1031001	1																						
20	20		301							1	Liv	It's a bit surprising that this comes from you.	1																					
21	21		302								It doesn't sound like you.	22	There's nothing wrong with that.	22																				
22	22		201							1	1021001																							
23	23		301							1	Lucia	Indeed.	1

28	28		201							1	1031001	1																						
29	29		301							1	Liv	I wonder what kind of person we'll meet this time...	1																					
30	30		201							1	1011001																							
31	31		301							1	Lee	The memory prototype this time is called Catherine. A large part of the data about her is missing. The only information we have now is that she had the ability of healing before.	1																					
32	32		201							1	500077																							
33	33		301							1	Catherine	I'm Catherine, the lord of the Rose Garden. Glad to meet all of you. Sorry to keep you waiting.	1																					
34	34		201							1	1021001	1																						
35	35		301							1	Lucia	Good to see you.	1

37	37		301								Lucia	So are you already aware of our mission and purpose?	1																					
38	38		201							1	500077																							
39	39		301							1	Catherine	...	1																					
40	40		302								What's wrong?	41	Catherine?	41																				
41	41		301								Catherine	I'm sorry. Perhaps I've been living in the darkness for too long. It's a bit uncomfortable stepping into the bright sunlight.	1																					
42	42		302								I remember...	43	It's all right.	43																				
43	43		301								Catherine	I used to fear the darkness and constriction. But I knew that everything would be just fine.	1																					
44	44		301								Catherine	Speaking of which, you remind me of a long-lost friend.	1																					
45	45		302								Me?	46	...	46																				
46	46		301								Catherine	Mr. Commandant, if you fight for me, I'll do everything I can to protect you.	1																					
47	47		301								Catherine	Ah, forget about it. It's just the moment I saw you...	1																					
48	48		301								Catherine	I don't know why, but I just wanna say this to you... one more time.	1																					
49	49		302								...	50	I'm back, Catherine.	50

53	53		301							1	Lucia	Miss Catherine, we have something to ask you.	1																					
54	54		204							1	1																							
55	55		301								Lucia	Will you join and help us from now on?	1																					
56	56		201							1	1031001	14																						
57	57		301							1	Liv	It would be better... if there's no research or experiments...	1																					
58	58		201							1	500077																							
59	59		301							1	Catherine	Of course, my pleasure. As for research and experiments, I'm not made for that. Besides...	1																					
60	60		301								Catherine	Miss Lucia, you'd be a lot more adorable if you stop being so tense.	1																					
61	61		201							1	1021001	4																						
62	62		301							1	Lucia	I see... I'll try.	1																					
63	63		201							1	500077																							
64	64		301							1	Catherine	Doesn't seem like it.	1																					
65	65		301								Catherine	Doesn't matter, we've got time.	1																					
66	66		301								Catherine	Here are some scarlet petals for you. May your dreams one day be fulfilled.	1
