5	5		301								Watanabe	Why are you still here?	1																					
6	6		302								I was worried...	7	...I'm sorry.	8																				
7	7	9	301								Watanabe	Relax. I'm not human, I don't die that easily.	1																					
8	8		301								Watanabe	There's nothing to apologize for. This is war. No one comes out the other side unscathed every time.	1																					
9	9		301								Watanabe	That said... it seems that I'll have to rest up for a while.	1																					
10	10		301								Watanabe	But... there's no next time...	1

12	12		301								Watanabe	...	1

14	14		301								Watanabe	Let me ask youâ€”the Eden that you envision... what is it like?	1																					
15	15		302								Equal, free, safe...	16	Just like the one you envision, I think.	17																				
16	16	18	301								Watanabe	Ha. I guess we're similar, aren't we?	1																					
17	17		301								Watanabe	What a crafty answer.	1																					
18	18		301								Watanabe	The apocalypse hasn't ended, not just because of the Punishing Virus or the war... It's because of the humans. Because of human nature.	1																					
19	19		301								Watanabe	The exploiters and the exploited, the oppressors and the oppressed... those who make choices, and those who get their choices taken away... This... loop, it never ends.	1																					
20	20		301								Watanabe	Eventually... they don't even lie about it anymore, those prideful bastards.	1																					
21	21		301								Watanabe	But no one has the right to decide someone else's fate. No one gets to say who lives or dies, who stays, and who is left behind.	1																					
22	22		204							1	8																							
23	23		301								Watanabe	Closing your eyes so you can't see, trying to forget if you did see... Running away if you can't forget. Up there, far away, with everything you would forsake.	1																					
24	24		204							1																								
25	25		301								Watanabe	...Better to stand where the world refuses to face, to challenge it, to create a real "Eden".	1																					
26	26		302								...Why would you fight so hard for that?	27	You're the idealist, aren't you?	28																				
27	27	29	301								Watanabe	Why? For the Eden I envision, of course...	1																					
28	28		301								Watanabe	Perhaps, as much as it pains me to admit it. Maybe that's why... we're similar.	1																					
29	29		301								Watanabe	A naive idealist.	1																					
30	30		301								Watanabe	...Like you.	1																					
31	31		301								Watanabe	As long as there are humans like you, I guess the world is not beyond saving.	1																					
32	32		301								Watanabe	But how can there be more of you on that flying boat, I wonder?	1																					
33	33		302								Let's create the real Eden.	34	I look forward to your Eden.	34																				
34	34		301								Watanabe	Do you know why I saved you?	1																					
35	35		302								Because you promised?	36	No, I don't...	36																				
36	36		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Watanabe	Because, in my Eden, you'll be safe...	1
