11	11		301			RImgBg1Shake						High explosive rounds continue to decimate the Corrupted. The Pulao Crew member takes a frag grenade from his bandolier and hurls it over, then dashes to protect Changyu who had fallen to the ground.

13	13		301									The grenade knocks the Corrupted off the platform, then as if in pursuit, an anti-air missile destroys it with pinpoint precision. The black feathers burn up before they can even touch the ground.

39	39		301									Laoyu watches the director slowly disappear down the street. He raises his sleeve to wipe the tears from his eyes, then walks toward the port with the unconscious Changyu on his back.
