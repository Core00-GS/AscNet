14	14		301								Unfamiliar Man	Ah, no no, hahahaha! I'm not lost!	1																					
15	15		301								Unfamiliar Man	See this beauty? It's an antique snowmobile, Snow Leopard M958. Good for all terrains, totally swag, most popular in New Durkan in the Post-Pandemic Age. They don't manufacture this no more. The one and only in the world!	1																					
16	16		301								Unfamiliar Man	She's been with me much longer than some Corrupted been walkin'!	1

28	28		301								Watanabe	This used to be the biggest military research base in Cape Nohama. After the Post-Pandemic Age, all land-based airforce soldiers have fled the base.	1																					
29	29		301								Watanabe	As for what's hidden in the base, only the soldiers and researchers who love their antifreeze and thrust-weight ratios know.	1

69	69		302								It's fine.	70																						
70	70		301								Clark	However, do know that this guy in front of you is not trustworthy. Countless scavengers have frozen to death in the snowy plains because of him.	1																					
71	71		301								Clark	He has no name. Just an old riffraff that came out of nowhere.	1																					
72	72		301								Clark	He'd tell the scavengers seeking a home or passing treasure-hunters that he's the "Gravekeeper" of Cape Nohama.	1																					
73	73		301								Clark	We've saved countless hapless fools who lost all their belongings to him in this area.	1

103	103		301								Gravekeeper	Uh... r-really?	2																					
104	104		301								Watanabe	Yes. And if it works out well, the Forsaken may consider a long-term arrangement with you.	1

107	107		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Watanabe	On one condition: no more scamming in our territory or bringing trouble to the Forsaken. I trust that the payment we can offer should be much better than what you usually get by robbing hard-up travelers.	1
