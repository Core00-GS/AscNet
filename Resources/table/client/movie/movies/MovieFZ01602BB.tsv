11	11		301									Rohacchi points at his lower body. A makeshift skirt crudely fashioned out of red and yellow vinyl fabric is wrapped around his waist.																						
12	12		301								Rohacchi	It. Messes. With. My. Joints.	3																					
13	13		301									Rohacchi speaks in his usual intermittent way and reaches over to remove the dress.																						
14	14		301								Nanami	No, no, no! You can't take it off! You gotta stay in character!	1																					
15	15		301								Rohacchi	What. Character?	3

22	22		301								Nanami	You'll be that... uhh... whatchamacallit... Marshal Martin?	1																					
23	23		301								Martin	What's a... marshal?	2																					
24	24		301								Nanami	It's like being some super duper guy back in the Golden Age... I think?	1																					
25	25		301								Martin	...That tells me nothing.	2

33	33		301								Nanami	The directions it gave me were way too vague! How'd I ever find the place in such a massive area?!	1																					
34	34		301								Martin	...Any other info outside of the coordinates?	2																					
35	35		301								Nanami	Hmmm... Lemme see... It told me to find a big ol' antenna? And in case I don't know what an antenna looks like, it even gave me a picture and all...	1

44	44		301									Ignoring Nanami's question, Martin and Rohacchi walk away.																						
45	45		301									Creating some distance between Nanami and themselves, Martin finally answers her question.																						
46	46		301								Martin	We'll go look for it ourselves! We'll let you know if we find it!																						
47	47		301								Nanami	Youâ€”Wait for me! I'll go look for it too!	1
