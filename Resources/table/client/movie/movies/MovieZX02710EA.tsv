17	17		301			DialogEnable						It has been a while since Haicma joined the Church of Machina. As an organized, militarized group of machines, each church member performs their role adequately and diligently.																						
18	18		301									However, Haicma slowly realizes that... information is not entirely transparent between church members. More precisely, "Mother" is the only one who knows what the Church of Machina is doing and where it is heading.																						
19	19		301									Similar to "Gear", the Church of Machina's army, Haicma is just another cog of this machine.																						
20	20		301									Many things have changed during her role as a cog: "Chariot" fell, the Punishing Virus evolved, and the Church suffered greatly. Simply recording and analyzing the data has taken most of Haicma's processing power.																						
21	21		301									—It must have been a long time since she last observed nature this seriously.

49	49		301								Haicma	Why... is Nanami inside the Red Tide?	2																					
50	50		301									Her program logic suggests that this is impossible. Haicma last confirmed Nanami's location 118 hours, 86 minutes, and 32 seconds ago. Nanami does not have any reason or enough time to arrive here.																						
51	51		301									Not to mention that the Nanami before her is still equipped with her original frame.																						
52	52		301									Nanami chuckles, playing in the Red Tide as if playing in a swimming pool. Haicma remembers Nanami doing the same when her frame was submerged in maintenance fluid for inspection.																						
53	53		301									Who is that? Can she be Nanami? What... should Haicma do?

109	109		301									Or are her programs insufficient to support her duty?

116	116		301									That is how Haicma keeps her programs running.
