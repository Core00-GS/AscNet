5	5		301									With a solemn expression, Lee gathers the team and announces his plan.																						
6	101		302								Her place in human society?	6	Are you sending Nanami away?	111																				
7	6	8	301								Lee	Yes. I think this is best for everyone. Hear me out.	1

11	8		301								Lee	I plan to send Nanami to Babylonia's residential district. By her mental age, it should be possible to enroll her in school.	1

13	10		301							1	Liv	A school... Can Constructs even go to school?	1																					
14	11		201							1	1011001																							
15	12		301								Lee	Of course. Schools are not only for the acquisition of knowledge, but also for the formation of a social identity.	1																					
16	13		301								Lee	Though the rules and regulations at school might tie Nanami down, they won't get in the way of her research.	1																					
17	14		301								Lee	Whether she wants to research individuals or groups, a school will suit her needs.	1																					
18	15		301								Lee	What do you think, Nanami?	1

21	18		301							1	Nanami	Hmm... Nanami knows about school, duh. But is it fun?	2																					
22	19		301								Lee	It's not about fun. It's a place of learning. It won't be bad for you.	1																					
23	20		301								Nanami	If it gets me a chance to research humans... what do you think, Commandant?	2																					
24	102		302								I think this will be better.	21	If it helps Nanami...	24																				
25	21		301								Nanami	Does Commandant want to send Nanami away?	2																					
26	22		301								Lee	The Commandant simply agrees with me, that this is the best choice for you.	1																					
27	23		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Nanami	No problem.	2																					
28	24		301								Lee	Of course it will help. I will apply for the transfer with Babylonia immediately. All you need to do is sign, Commandant.	1																					
29	25		301								Nanami	W-wait!	2																					
30	26		301								Lee	Why wait? You want to finish your research, right?	1																					
31	27		301								Nanami	Um... yeah.	2																					
32	28		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lee	It's settled then. Wait here for my good news.	1
