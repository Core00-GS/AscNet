5	5		301							1	???	Hey, Lofte. You on patrol duty today? What are you looking at outside the church?	1																					
6	6		201							1	500005																							
7	7		301							1	Lofte	Oh hi, Toby. Yeah, I got thrown all the patrol missions ever since you took time off to nurse your injuries.	1																					
8	8		201							1	500131																							
9	9		301							1	Toby	Wow, sorry for the extra work, haha. Here, something for your hard work.	1																					
10	10		202							1					1																			
11	11		301									Toby throws a pack of MRE rations at Lofte.																						
12	12		201							1	500005																							
13	13		301							1	Lofte	Oh come off it, you. Are those provisions for the church?	1																					
14	14		201							1	500131																							
15	15		301							1	Toby	Haha, you got me.	1																					
16	16		201							1	500005																							
17	17		301							1	Lofte	Sigh, that old man Kaif, always asking you to help with deliveries. It's fine when you were healthy but how can your wounds heal now!	1																					
18	18		201							1	500131																							
19	19		301							1	Toby	Nah, I just treat it as rehabilitation.	1																					
20	20		301								Toby	Enough about me, I remember today is not a holy day, why's the church so noisy?	1																					
21	21		201							1	500005																							
22	22		301							1	Lofte	It's been like that ever since that sister came to this church.	1																					
23	23		201							1	500131																							
24	24		301							1	Toby	Nun?	1																					
25	25		201							1	500005																							
26	26		301							1	Lofte	Yeah, an army from Kuzath Snow Plain stopped by a while ago, they left a sister here and continued down south with the other survivors.	1																					
27	27		201							1	500131																							
28	28		301							1	Toby	Oh, I remember them. Their leader looked tough. I wonder if my arrows are faster than his blades, hehe.	1																					
29	29		202							1					1																			
30	30		301									Having said that, Toby raises his left arm to chest level with the supply crate in hand, while making a drawing motion with his right hand, aiming for a point beyond the horizon and mimicking the sounds of shooting arrows himself.																						
31	31		201							1	500005																							
32	32		301							1	Lofte	Can't you just take it easy for a day...	1																					
33	33		201							1	500131																							
34	34		301							1	Toby	How can I protect you all if I don't train constantly?	1																					
35	35		201							1	500005																							
36	36		301							1	Lofte	Alright, alright, let me continue. That sister... I think she's called Bianca?	1																					
37	37		201							1	500131																							
38	38		301							1	Toby	Bianca... I've been hearing that name quite a lot recently.	1

44	44		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Sister A	Did you hear? That newcomer got into quite a lot of trouble and everyone was afraid of her, so she got abandoned here at our church.																						
45	45		301								Sister B	...I heard she killed the father who raised her up.																						
46	46		301								Sister C	Oh my Lord!																						
47	47		301								Sister A	I can't believe a church raised a sister like that, no, more like a "witch"...																						
48	48		301								Sister C	Hmph, she didn't even deny it when asked, she's definitely guilty if you ask me.																						
49	49		301								Sister B	Ahem, someone's coming over.																						
50	50		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Toby	...

52	52		201							1	500140																							
53	53		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Citizen A	Sigh, there've been disappearances more and more lately, even that homeless old man's gone.	1																					
54	54		201							1	500139																							
55	55		301							1	Citizen B	Speaking of him, I remember seeing him with that new sister from the church before, you don't think...	1																					
56	56		201							1	500140																							
57	57		301							1	Citizen A	I think you're on to something here. Come to think of it, we started seeing more people going missing after that Bianca came here.	1																					
58	58		201							1	500139																							
59	59		301							1	Citizen B	Then it must've been her! We should chase her out of town and then we'll be safe.	1																					
60	60		201							1	500140																							
61	61		301							1	Citizen A	I know, right? It's so obvious but those soldiers are still doing nothing! Why are we paying taxes to feed those slackers?!	1																					
62	62		201							1	500139																							
63	63		301							1	Citizen B	Who in their right mind would want to become a soldier anyway if not for the current situation? Except for Toby, that kid's an exception.	1																					
64	64		201							1	500140																							
65	65		301							1	Citizen A	Yeah, good kids like him are rare to come by nowadays.	1																					
66	66		201							1	500139																							
67	67		301							1	Citizen B	Shh, she's coming over, let's go.	1

74	74		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Lofte	I heard she killed the father who raised her on the snow plains.	1																					
75	75		202							1					1																			
76	76		301									Toby is pulled back to reality by Lofte's voice. Following Lofte's gaze, he sees a blond girl sitting in a corner all by herself.																						
77	77		201							1	500131																							
78	78		301							1	Toby	Yeah... but I think she's just misunderstood. She may look cold, but I don't think she's a bad person.	1																					
79	79		201							1	500005																							
80	80		301							1	Lofte	Ha, only you would think that.	1																					
81	81		202							1					1																			
82	82		301									Toby waves at Bianca passionately, catching the attention of those in the church.																						
83	83		201							1	500005																							
84	84		301							1	Lofte	Welp, it's time for guard duty so I'll see you later. Though I suggest you keep your distance from her.	1																					
85	85		202							1					1																			
86	86		301									Before Toby could reply, the crowd that has caught sight of Toby swarmed over.																						
87	87		301								Father Leon	Toby!																						
88	88		201							1	500131																							
89	89		301							1	Toby	Good afternoon, Father Leon. Here's the provisions for this week.	1																					
90	90		202							1					1																			
91	91		301									Toby places the supply crate on the ground and taps on the monitor of the crate a few times.																						
92	92		301									The supply crate opens up on all four sides, revealing the supplies inside.																						
93	93		301								Father Leon	Thank you, Toby. Looks like Kaif's being lazy again. But I heard you were recovering from your injuries, why are you out here working?																						
94	94		201							1	500131																							
95	95		301							1	Toby	They're pretty much healed already, but thanks for asking, Father.	1																					
96	96		201							1	500139																							
97	97		301							1	Citizen B	Long time no see, Toby! Heard you got hurt in the last battle, you've got us worried sick.	1																					
98	98		201							1	500131																							
99	99		301							1	Toby	I'm fine, I'm fine. 'Tis but a scratch. Look, I'm healthy as a horse!	1																					
100	100		202							1					1																			
101	101		301									Toby runs his fingers through his brilliant blond hair while his right hand reaches for his bow on his back. He then poses in a way which he thought looks cool, causing the bystanders to laugh, consequently lifting the mood.																						
102	102		301								Father Leon	We're all happy that you've recovered. All right, we shan't hold you up. Come, there's a supply pack for everyone.																						
103	103		301									The father claps his hands and the people gathered around Toby swiftly form a line.																						
104	104		301									Everyone prays in front of the supply crate before taking their own share. The whole process proceeds without a hitch.																						
105	105		301									Toby notices that Bianca stood at the end of the line the whole time with no intention to come forward and claim her supplies, so he takes out a supply pack from the crate and heads over to Bianca.																						
106	106		201							1	500131																							
107	107		301							1	Toby	Hey there, are you feeling unwell? Here's your share of the provisions.	1																					
108	108		301								Toby	Also, here's a flower for a lovely lady like you.	1																					
109	109		202							1					1																			
110	110		301									Toby holds out the supply pack to Bianca, and on top of the pack lies a single white lily.																						
111	111		201							1	500024																							
112	112		301							1	Bianca	No, thank you. Though I do appreciate the thought.	1																					
113	113		201							1	500131																							
114	114		301							1	Toby	What? But you'll starve! That...	1																					
115	115		202							1					1																			
116	116		301									Before Toby could finish his sentence, a woman inserts herself between them, putting a stop to the conversation.																						
117	117		201							1	500133																							
118	118		301							1	Sister A	Toby, don't mind her. She said she doesn't need it so just leave her.	1																					
119	119		202							1					1																			
120	120		301								Father Leon	You, where are your manners?!																						
121	121		201							1	500136																							
122	122		301							1	Citizen C	Yeah! Come over here, Toby, don't mind her.	1																					
123	123		201							1	500131																							
124	124		301							1	Toby	Wha? It's fine, I...	1																					
125	125		201							1	500136																							
126	126		301							1	Citizen C	Sorry about her, Toby. She's always like this. You should just stay away from her. Oh right, I heard there have been disappearances nearby here lately too.	1																					
127	127		201							1	500139																							
128	128		301							1	Citizen B	It's getting more and more worrisome, you should be careful too.	1																					
129	129		202							1					1																			
130	130		301									With everyone's attention on him, Toby cannot continue his conversation with Bianca. Instead, he addresses the crowd.																						
131	131		201							1	500131																							
132	132		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Toby	Don't worry, I'll protect each and every one of you! It's my duty as a soldier after all!	1
