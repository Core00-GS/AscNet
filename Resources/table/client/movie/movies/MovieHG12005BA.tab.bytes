3	3		301			DialogEnable						‚ÄîWhat comes after humans?																						
4	4		301									‚ÄîWe are creating our successors at this very moment.																						
5	5		301									‚ÄîThey are as capable as humans. You will grant them capabilities that exceed humans.																						
6	6		301									‚ÄîScientists will have to evaluate their fruits of labor soon and confront the moral responsibility of their actions, especially so when their inventions will chart the courses of humanity's future.																						
7	7		301									‚ÄîWe cannot hide inside our laboratories with our research without considering the ethics of its nature.																						
8	8		301									Line after line, Chrome reads you the key ideas in the book.																						
9	9		301									There is no need for further explanations‚Äîthe lines are plain and straightforward. This book, written during the Golden Age, acutely points out the problems of human societies that persist today.																						
10	10		301									Following the same upward spiral, the subject in question might be different, but the problems it produces is largely the same.																						
11	11		301									This never-ending war with the Punishing Virus has covered up what should be plainly obvious with a game of life and death.																						
12	12		301									What humankind is confronting in this age of both old and new‚Äîthis liminal bedlam‚Äîis not born from the Punishing Virus. It stems from the inherent conflict of humanity itself.																						
13	13		301									Constructs and humans are the best examples.																						
14	14		301									...																						
15	15		301									How should Constructs be defined? Are they of Us, or are they the Other?																						
16	16		301									No one has yet to provide an answer that satisfies everyone.

19	19		301				DialogDisable			1	Chrome	How do you feel about this, „Äêkuroname„Äë?	1																					
20	20		302								Regarding this topic...	21																						
21	21		302								I don't think I have the right to speak on it, unlike you.	22																						
22	22		301			DialogEnable					Chrome	I must disappoint you, then. I've never stopped thinking about this, but I have yet to come to a conclusion.	1																					
23	23		302								Then that should be my answer too.	24																						
24	24		301								Chrome	I think most people would say it's the latter.	1																					
25	25		301									‚ÄîThe Other.																						
26	26		301									That was the reason for what transpired earlier today.																						
27	27		302								Are you disappointed?	28																						
28	28		301								Chrome	You seem to have asked me something similar not long ago.	1																					
29	29		301								Chrome	No, I'm not disappointed. It wasn't unexpected.	1																					
30	30		301								Chrome	I'm just... concerned.	1																					
31	31		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Chrome's eyes stay on your face, but he has his gaze on something far more remote, somewhere in the far future.																						
32	32		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The pink hue of the artificial dusk quietly fades to a navy night sky.																						
33	33		301								Chrome	You might find my concern ridiculous, but I worry that...	1																					
34	34		302								You worry that the world is getting a little colder.	35																						
35	35		301									You inadvertently speak your mind before Chrome can finish his sentence.																						
36	36		301								Chrome	That wasn't what I wanted to say, but... you understand what I was going for.	1																					
37	37		301								Chrome	To position Constructs as Others so that people can be indifferent to the casualties of battles...	1																					
38	38		301								Chrome	This war will create new problems for humanity, and it's not the Punishing Virus.	1																					
39	39		301								Chrome	What is legal and what is moral... the line between them will only get more and more unclear.	1																					
40	40		301								Chrome	When I was confused, if not enraged, by this idea, I came to the realization of something else.	1																					
41	41		301								Chrome	Even if the Punishing Virus is eliminated... it's still possible to find more conflicts in the future, leading to more clashes and wars.	1																					
42	42		301									He does not specify who will be warring with whom.																						
43	43		301				DialogDisable					Even now, it is too cruel to say them out loud.																						
44	44		302								Perhaps.	45																						
45	45		302								But I don't feel too pessimistic about it.	46																						
46	46		301			DialogEnable	DialogDisable				Chrome	Oh?	1																					
47	47		302								Some people are thinking about it.	48																						
48	48		302								Some people are looking for a way forward.	49																						
49	49		302								Like you.	50																						
50	50		301			DialogEnable					Chrome	...	1																					
51	51		202							1					1																			
52	52		301									Chrome stays silent.																						
53	53		301									And the silence stretches longer than usual.																						
54	54		301									In the end, it is neither you nor Chrome who breaks the silence.																						
55	55		301									A student shows up out of nowhere, walking toward Chrome slightly awkwardly.																						
56	56		301									You reckon he has to be a student studying here to know the spot you are in.																						
57	57		301									It seems that Chrome and you have taken up the desk where he usually studies.																						
58	58		201							1	500104																							
59	59		301							1	Student	I'm sorry to disturb you... but are you Langston Smith?	1																					
60	60		301									Chrome nods.																						
61	61		301									The student does not even try to hide his ecstatic expression.																						
62	62		301								Student	I just saw you in the distance and I wondered if it was actually you.	1																					
63	63		301								Student	I thought you would be giving a speech on the stage today...	1																					
64	64		301									Realizing what he is about to say seems inappropriate, the student stops like a stuck cassette tape, his line abruptly ending halfway through. His eyes dart around in a slight panic.																						
65	65		301									And when he glimpses the book in Chrome's hands, his eyes glow.																						
66	66		301								Student	...You're also reading it?	1																					
67	67		301								Student	Do you mind if I ask you about some of the things written on it?	1																					
68	68		202							1					1																			
69	69		301									Chrome looks toward you as if asking for your permission as his companion.																						
70	70		302								(Smile and nod)	71																						
71	71		301									Thus, he nods at the student as well.																						
72	72		201							1	500104																							
73	73		301							1	Student	What an honor, sir. What an honor...	1																					
74	74		202							1					1																			
75	75		301									The student is babbling at this point.																						
76	76		301									...																						
77	77		301									Their discussion lasts for a very long time.																						
78	78		301									Eventually, Chrome stands up.																						
79	79		301									He looks at you one more time.																						
80	80		201							1	500309	1																						
81	81		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Chrome	It's late now, „Äêkuroname„Äë. It's time we give our seats to the future.	1
