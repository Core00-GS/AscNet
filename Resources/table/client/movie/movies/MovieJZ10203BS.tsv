5	5		301							1	Nikola	Despite some organizational hiccups, Construct Lucia passed all the required assessments.	2																					
6	6		301							1	Technician	Do you mean to send her into combat, sir?	3																					
7	7		301								Nikola	Yeah.	2																					
8	8		301								Technician	That carries certain risks, sir. I'm sure with more observation...	3																					
9	9		301								Nikola	We will never get real data if we don't deploy her. The Purifying Force exists for that exact eventuality.	2																					
10	10		301									Understanding that Nikola had his mind set, the technician shakes her head and pulls up a selection of Military Construct files on the terminal.																						
11	11		301								Technician	Understood. We're allocating new members to Gray Raven... Do you have any special considerations, sir?	3																					
12	12		301								Nikola	A support-type is a must, and also an armored one... no, Kurono leadership can decide on the second member.	2																					
13	13		301								Technician	Kurono? Why's that?	3																					
14	14		301								Nikola	Just to be fair. They may have their own considerations on who to pair up with Lucia.	2																					
15	15		301								Technician	Understood. I will send the files to your office once the team members are confirmed.	3

19	19		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						One day, in the halls of Babylonia																						
20	20		301									It was an important day. I felt my body tense and seize multiple times, as if I were an old machine with outdated servos.																						
21	21		301									It was all because of a message from Commandant several days prior.																						
22	22		301								Command Central	After careful consideration from the Command Central, we have decided to replenish Gray Raven's ranks, and start preparations for combat operations.																						
23	23		301									Many more bureaucratic entries followed, but my attention was solely focused on the short, curt notice.																						
24	24		301									Two reinforcing teammates were coming over, both with groundside combat experience. That is to say, we were combat-ready.																						
25	25		301									I felt joy at the turn of events, but also worry about what Gray Raven would turn into.																						
26	26		301									—At least, I hoped history wouldn't repeat itself.																						
27	27		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Just daydreaming here did me no good. At Commandant's reminder, I opened the office door.

32	32		301							1		Two unfamiliar faces in the office turned towards me. Male, blue. Female, pink.																						
33	33		301									I was at a loss for words, but such was the first impressions I had of my new teammates.																						
34	34		301							1		The male Construct noticed me, but made no visible response, coolly appraising his surroundings.	2																					
35	35		204							3	6																							
36	36		301							1		The female Construct, however, kept fidgeting, shifting her position and posture. Whenever our eyes locked, hers would inevitably lower as her face reddened.	3																					
37	37		301									Two individuals, clearly different from me, but bursting with personality.																						
38	38		301									Commandant did not speak, and neither did they. I knew the burden of breaking the silence fell on my shoulders. If I didn't, Gray Raven would never spread its wings, and our story would never start.

45	46		301			DialogEnable					Lucia	Hello, my name is Lucia, frame designation BPL-01, Lotus, also the team leader of Gray Raven—																						
46	47		301								Lucia	I look forward to working with you!																						
47	48		301									I felt my M.I.N.D. destabilize as I spoke the words, even though no harm had come to me. I recognized the emotion as "embarrassment", but I resolved to finish the sentence nonetheless.																						
48	49		301									After the stiff greeting, I felt my respiration resume without realizing it had halted in the first place. As Commandant started clapping slowly in the doorway, I was reaffirmed that I had done the right thing.																						
49	50		301									Swept along by the emotions swirling in the office, the two Constructs spoke up. The male took the lead.																						
50	51		301								Lee	My name is Lee, frame designation BPN-06, Palefire.																						
51	52		301								Lee	My original team... is not important. I have been assigned to Gray Raven. Dual guns are my weapons of choice.																						
52	53		301								Lee	I am equally adept at strategic planning and close combat.																						
53	54		301									Lee, Palefire. The file identified him as an Attacker, same as me.																						
54	55		301								Liv	My turn... um, my name is Liv, Support Construct.																						
55	56		301								Liv	I came from Egret... my preferred weapons are levitated weapons platforms. I look forward to working together.																						
56	57		301								Lee	What about your version?																						
57	58		301								Liv	Oh... I'm sorry, designation BPN-08, Eclipse.																						
58	59		301									Though a bit shy, Liv nonetheless finished her introduction.																						
59	60		301								Lee	Egret, I see... the team well-known for their meticulous strategy...																						
60	61		301									Lee visibly fell into a short computational cycle, as if seizing on freshly-gathered intelligence.																						
61	62		301								Liv	Uh...																						
62	63		301									It only served to exacerbate Liv's restlessness.																						
63	64		301									Lucia, Lee, and Liv.																						
64	65		301									Those were our names.																						
65	66		301									Lotus, Palefire, and Eclipse.																						
66	67		301									The codenames given to our frames.																						
67	68		301									Katanas, dual guns, and levitating cannons.																						
68	69		301									The weapons we wielded.																						
69	70		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					This was the new Gray Raven.
