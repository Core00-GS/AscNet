31	31		301			DialogEnable					Kamui	Yeah. I hadn't been able to get in contact with him since last night. He often disappeared out of nowhere like this, too, but usually he'd be back by morning.	1																					
32	32		301								Kamui	If he were still with me, I wouldn't have minded, but...	1																					
33	33		301								Kamui	It's the first time this happened... so I can't be sure where he is either.	1

49	49		301									The Council must know where he is, which means that he is not posing a threat to anyone right now. On the other hand, you also do not exactly want the officials to "capture" Camu and force him to return.

74	75		201							1	500175	5																						
75	76		301							1	Camu	I'm tired of repeating myself, Gray Raven Commandant. Listen, we have nothing to do with each other outside of our missions. You don't know anything about me and are in no position to stand here and talk about things you don't understand.	1																					
76	77		301									He speaks without emotion, gaze full of judgment.																						
77	78		301								Camu	Or are you acting all concerned because you want something from me?	1																					
78	79		302								I'm not acting.	81	You don't have anything I want.	80																				
79	80		301								Camu	...Do you want to die or something?	1																					
80	81		301								Camu	So what exactly do you want, then? To get to know me? Fine. I'll tell you what I think.	1																					
81	82		301								Camu	This world is despicable.	1																					
82	83		301								Camu	Babylonia... the Punishing Virus... the world itself... they're all the same. All filthy.	1																					
83	84		301								Camu	I'm just me. I'm not gonna change just because of a few pretty words you said, because I understand this world better than you do. It's not worth it, you know. Even without the virus, the world is just as corrupt.	1																					
84	85		301								Camu	If only the world would just end. We could start anew, then.	1																					
85	86		301								Camu	If I didn't know a thing, didn't have any of my past experiences... I might have ended up like Kamui.	1																					
86	87		301								Camu	But I'm not like him.	1																					
87	88		301								Camu	So don't waste your words and energy on me. Love... justice... those are foolish, selfish, self-righteous concepts.	1																					
88	89		302								...	90																						
89	90		301								Camu	I don't want to take responsibility for my powers. I'm not obliged to nor want to "save" this disgusting world.	1																					
90	91		301								Camu	Staying here is a temporary decision. There's no point in wasting energy on me.	1																					
91	92		301								Camu	Got it?	1																					
92	93		302								I see.	94	I don't get it.	102																				
93	94		301								Camu	...	1

96	97		302								I'm sorry.	98																						
97	98		301								Camu	What for?	1																					
98	99		302								For making assumptions about you.	100																						
99	100		302								I'll respect you as your own person from now on.	101

111	112		301								Camu	Ughhhhh!	1																					
112	113		301								Camu	I told you all that... and you didn't even react?	1																					
113	114		301								Camu	Shouldn't you see me as a monster and want to steer clear of me?	1																					
114	115		302								I don't feel that way.	116	I'll try to not let it bother me.	116																				
115	116		301								Camu	What... what's in that human noggin of yours?	1

121	122		301							1	Camu	What exactly do you want? To confuse me?	1

123	124		301								Camu	Out with it, now!	1																					
124	125		302								It's not that complicated.	126																						
125	126		302								If you want a reason...	127																						
126	127		302								It's because you're "Camu".	129																						
127	129		302								I want to see you smile...	130																						
128	130		302								As "Camu" and no one else.	131																						
129	131		302								I genuinely care about what you're thinking.	54269

133	134		301									It is rare to see him like that... though you do wish he would let go of your collar already.

153	154		302								No, even though it's my money you're spending...	160	First time hearing you say you "like" something.	155																				
154	155		301								Camu	"Like", huh?	1																					
155	156		301								Camu	The word just slipped out.	1

157	158		302								No. I was just relieved to hear you say it.	159

159	160		301								Camu	Hey, I'll get another serving. Double the spice!	1																					
160	161		302								I'll get one too!	162	Can you really taste it?	163																				
161	162	165	301								Camu	...One more serving, then.	1																					
162	163		301								Camu	Of course. Do you really have to ask about everything?	1																					
163	164		302								Just curious...	165
