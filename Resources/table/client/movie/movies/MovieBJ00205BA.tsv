3	3		301									Bexonidas and Halam unload the cumbersome auto grenade launcher stand from its position together. Squad 19-1 is pulling out of the observation post.																						
4	4		301									This auto grenade launcher has been with Squad 19-1 for six years. Halam, the grenadier, is probably the only one who remembers how many grenades it's fired.																						
5	5		301									However, it hasn't been used even once in this observation post. All 60 grenades still lie safely in the pack on Halam's back.

8	8		301							1	Halam	I don't think we'll even use this. Why don't we just stash it somewhere around here?	2																					
9	9		301							1	Bexonidas	You dolt, how would you like to be surrounded without this big guy?	3																					
10	10		301								Halam	To be honest, with the speed our "friends" are slicing and dicing, I don't think there will be any enemies left for us to observe by the time we reach the next station.	2																					
11	11		201							2	500005		-400																					
12	12		301							1	Bexonidas	We still have to go.	3																					
13	13		301								Gryphon	Chill, Halam, I don't want to end up carrying your rifle.	2																					
14	14		301								Gryphon	Tools and equipment are all packed and mounted on the vehicles, sarge.	2																					
15	15		301								Bexonidas	Good. You take the lead car.	3																					
16	16		301								Gryphon	We've got at most one and a half cars to rub between us.	2																					
17	17		301								Bexonidas	I mean I'll be lounging on the backseat and getting a very good nap.	3																					
18	18		301								Gryphon	A good nap... and a glass of sangria, perhaps? And a sandwich... and a—what do you call it—a maid?	2																					
19	19		301								Bexonidas	Whatever. As long as the maid doesn't have a face like yours, I wouldn't mind.	3																					
20	20		301								Gryphon	...[Beep—].	2																					
21	21		301									Gryphon starts the engine while giving Bexonidas the finger.																						
22	22		301									Bexonidas pulls his backpack into his chest and buries himself in the tattered car seat.																						
23	23		301									Just like every other break in between missions, he falls asleep almost instantly.																						
24	24		301									Perhaps because of the conversation with "Skyking", he dreams of the past.																						
25	25		301									In his dream, he was right there in the civil war his father had told him about.																						
26	26		301									They're in the northern tundra, in the snow-covered woods. A fully armed special force, standing there watching as "His Majesty", whom they've fought so hard to protect, flies away on an orbital transport, leaving them behind.																						
27	27		301									Confused and lost, the soldiers exchange glances, and finally begin to take inventory.																						
28	28		301									Rations, weapons, ammunition, tents, fully drivable vehicles, somewhat drivable vehicles, fuel, medication...																						
29	29		301									The statistics lead them to but one conclusion: Either 40% of them have to go, or they all die.																						
30	30		301									At first, they fought over disagreements; Then, over raids and resources; After that, people no longer cared what they were fighting for.																						
31	31		301									All the soldiers remembered were their accessories: trinkets they wore that told them who to shoot, and who not to.																						
32	32		301									Flags and crests were soon trampled and forgotten in the snow, replaced by simpler, more feral symbols. The men of Squad 19 started wearing skulls on their heads, while those of Squad 20 decorated themselves with mountain plants.																						
33	33		301									But the war, meaningless yet unstoppable continued for more than a decade.																						
34	34		301									And in the memories of his father's generation, the one who finally stopped the war was "Skyking"—Watanabe, leader of the Forsaken.																						
35	35		301									And right now, not far from his position, Watanabe is on a mission, and Bexonidas is helping.																						
36	36		301									He pinches himself, but it doesn't deflate the pride swelling in his chest.																						
37	37		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					If Gryphon, that blockhead, hadn't slammed on the brakes out of nowhere, causing Bexonidas to nearly conk his head, he'd probably have been able to bask in the excitement for a few more minutes.

39	39		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Bexonidas	Gryphon, where'd you get your license?	3																					
40	40		301								Gryphon	Shh!	2																					
41	41		301									Gryphon pulls out his submachine gun with his left hand and gestures at Bexonidas to be quiet with his right.																						
42	42		301								Bexonidas	What's going on?	3																					
43	43		301								Gryphon	I've got movement, and lots of it.	2																					
44	44		301								Gryphon	The strays from Titan Trench have linked up with elements from other areas.	2																					
45	45		301								Bexonidas	...[Beep—], if these enemies surround them...	3																					
46	46		301								Gryphon	Orders are for radio silence, and HQ is at least 10 clicks from our current position.	2																					
47	47		301								Bexonidas	Looks like either we pretend we saw nothing and let our leader and his "guests" get swarmed...	3																					
48	48		301								Bexonidas	...or we go and do something really [Beep—]ing stupid.	3																					
49	49		301								Gryphon	...	2																					
50	50		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Gryphon	Heh, as if we've ever done anything not stupid.	2

55	55		301								Watanabe	I repeat. 19-1, this is Skyking. Please respond.	1																					
56	56		301									...																						
57	57		301								Watanabe	...Squadron 19 is late. That's rare.	1																					
58	58		302								Is there a problem?	59																						
59	59		301								Watanabe	...Possibly, but we don't have time for it.	1																					
60	60		301								Watanabe	The passage to the hangar is up ahead. If we break their lines here, we sever their lines of communication.	1																					
61	61		302								Understood. Let's do it, then.	62																						
62	62		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Watanabe	Yes.	1
