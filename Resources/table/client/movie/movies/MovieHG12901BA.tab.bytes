15	15		302								All is well.	16	I'm almost there.	16																				
16	16		301								Lucia	That's good.	1																					
17	17		302								How about you guys?	18																						
18	18		301								Lucia	We've removed the threats in Zone C. The west side of City 072 is now free of Corrupted.	1																					
19	19		301								Lucia	We're now taking stock of the remaining supplies.	1																					
20	20		301									Transportation between the surface and Babylonia has recommenced. Over ten conservation areas have since requested assistance from the Task Force. You answered the call and were sent to help their reconstruction efforts.																						
21	21		301									City 072's CPF has been reactivated, and many refugees and Scavengers have been moved there to await medical treatment. Demand for supplies has drastically increased, but communication with Babylonia remains chaotic.																						
22	22		301									Signing your assignment confirmation under Hippocrates' watchful eyes, you were surprised that she did not stop you. She simply sighed before waving her hand and leaving the rehabilitation room.																						
23	23		301									Lucia and the rest have been assigned to different support teams, setting up scanning devices in areas threatened by Hetero-Creatures. They are to eliminate all threats to secure the supply routes on the surface.

43	44		301			DialogEnable						You walk toward the entrance of the conservation area with the Task Force member accompanying you.																						
44	45		302								A bit chilly, isn't it...	46																						
45	46		301									The temperature on the surface has dropped quite drastically recently. Even a sunny afternoon like this feels cold when a breeze blows past you.																						
46	47		301									Someone is already waiting at the entrance. You walk up, presenting your identification.																						
47	48		301								System	Visitor identity confirmed. Welcome to the City 072 conservation area, „Äêkuroname„Äë.																						
48	49		301									The person who has been waiting for you is a scantily clad middle-aged man. After you confirm your mission with him, he leads you to the center of the conservation area.																						
49	50		301									This conservation area is even more crowded than you thought. Most refugees who have been transferred here are living in temporary tents.

51	52		301							1	Supervisor	You're the Gray Raven Commandant, aren't you?	1																					
52	53		301								Supervisor	I knew a Babylonia commandant would be arriving today, but I wasn't expecting you.	1																					
53	54		302								Ôºà?Ôºâ	55																						
54	55		301									Noticing your confusion, the supervisor chuckles.																						
55	56		301								Supervisor	You're a "hero" now. It's hard not to know who you are.	1																					
56	57		302								(Smile wryly)	58	(Remain silent)	58																				
57	58		301								Supervisor	If they're sending you here, then I suppose...																						
58	59		301									The supervisor lowers his head as if contemplating something, the rest of his words turning into inaudible mumbles.																						
59	60		302								Sorry?	61																						
60	61		301								Supervisor	Pardon me. It's nothing... I just heard you were seriously injured in the last battle and have yet to fully recover. I didn't think you'd be back on the surface so soon.	1																					
61	62		302								Can't seem to sit still.	63	I've more or less recovered.	63																				
62	63		302								Plus, we're short-handed right now.	64	And we can always use more people.	64																				
63	64		301									Since you are feeling better, you can no longer justify lying on a bed in Star of Life as your teammates send you their mission reports. Not that this mission is something you have never done before.																						
64	65		301								Supervisor	You are... exactly as people describe.	1																					
65	66		301								Supervisor	This place was a mess when we started... We didn't even have space to settle the new refugees.	1																					
66	67		301								Supervisor	But since transport to Babylonia has returned, we've been slowly receiving supplies. It's a glimmer of hope, so to speak.	1																					
67	68		301									The supervisor shows you a tired smile, the dark circles underneath his eyes revealing how little rest he has gotten.																						
68	69		302								I heard they're sending people from the Engineering Force to help rebuild.	70																						
69	70		301								Supervisor	Oh, right... From the base to the west, I think. Should have arrived a week ago if not for some problems with the energy station there.	1																					
70	71		301								Supervisor	We were understaffed everywhere... Supplies allocation was in disarray. Not a single place was doing well...	1																					
71	72		301								Supervisor	Luckily... some people from the Engineering Force arrived early a few days ago. We've been doing much better that past two days.	1																					
72	73		301									Following where the supervisor is pointing, you are surprised to find a familiar figure in the crowd.																						
73	74		302								...Karenina?	75																						
74	75		301									You notice her pair of standing Inver-Devices from afar. The white-headed girl is dragging supply crates taller than a human as she speaks to a staff member. The staff member reacts with unease before replying.																						
75	76		301									Hearing the reply, Karenina shoves a list into the staff member's hand before stomping off.																						
76	77		301									Before long, she has disappeared into the busy crowd.																						
77	78		302								They sent her...	79	Did something happen?	80																				
78	79	81	301								Supervisor	I was told that she came immediately after she finished organizing the reconstruction of the last base.	1																					
79	80		301								Supervisor	No... she did a lot.	1																					
80	81		301								Supervisor	Reinforcement on our temporary hospital, assessment reports, materials lists, supply requests... We were overwhelmed just settling the wounded, so she's been taking all the reconstruction work upon herself. We're all...	1																					
81	82		301								Supervisor	Hey, Wright! I told you to play in the park!	1																					
82	83		301									You can hear the sound of children playing nearby. The supervisor stops speaking halfway through, turning his head and shouting in their direction.																						
83	84		301									The children stop and lower their heads as he scolds them. The leading child looks down, fiddling with a controller, and you hear a buzz in the air‚Äîa small drone circles around, flying back toward the children.																						
84	85		301								Supervisor	And Jonathan... Why are you two everywhere? If you keep messing around, Bossma'am is going to take your drone back.	1																					
85	86		301									The children nod and retrieve the drone on the ground before hopping away. The supervisor sighs, returning to your side.																						
86	87		302								Bossma'am?	88	Drone?	89																				
87	88	90	301								Supervisor	It's what the kids call Karenina. She's been very popular with them ever since she fixed their toy drone...																						
88	89		301								Supervisor	Yeah... Karenina even fixed the drone the kids found in the trash. But thanks to that, we finally get to see the kids smiling again.																						
89	90		302								How many things has she done...	91																						
90	91		301								Supervisor	It's just... She overturned the previous rebuild plans the moment she arrived, saying they were too slow. Then she dived into work all alone, not listening to anyone...	1																					
91	92		301								Supervisor	Some of the folks stationed here know a thing or two about construction. They wanted to help, but communicating with her was difficult, and they were always rejected.	1																					
92	93		301								Supervisor	Her style is also very... hmm... No one was in danger, per se, but there were a lot of puzzling explosions.	1																					
93	94		302								(It's Karenina, after all...)	95																						
94	95		301								Supervisor	So everyone's been stressed. Folks are going to clash if we keep going like this.																						
95	96		302								She just wants to make things better as quickly as possible.	97	She's just bad at communicating.	98																				
96	97	99	301								Supervisor	Sigh... I know. It's what everyone here wants. Still...	1																					
97	98		301								Supervisor	Sigh... I can tell. She's a responsible leader, and she's taken a lot off our plates since she came. Still...	1																					
98	99		301								Supervisor	It's bad for everyone if she keeps going like this.	1																					
99	100		301									He sighs, shaking his head.																						
100	101		301								Supervisor	You're a commandant. Maybe she'll listen to you? If you don't mind... speaking with her.	1

104	105		301			DialogEnable						You head toward where Karenina went, arriving at a temporary shelter. The supervisor said there was a fight when they tried to recover this area. All the buildings were damaged, and this is the only building with a roof.																						
105	106		301									Some heavily-injured soldiers and Scavengers are currently lying on folding beds, moaning painfully in their dreams.																						
106	107		301								???	We can't accept that...																						
107	108		301								???	Are you kicking us out?!																						
108	109		301									You hear a muted shout, which causes a stir. You look toward where the sound comes from and find the girl you have been looking for surrounded by the residents, all of them looking unhappy and mad.																						
109	110		302								(There...)	111	(What happened?)	111																				
110	111		201							1	500494	4																						
111	112		301							1		Karenina seems to be arguing about something with the people there. Frowning, she is about to say something when her gaze goes across the crowd and meets yours.	1

116	117		301									For a second, Karenina looks like she is withholding something. Then she immediately looks away and focuses back on the residents surrounding her.																						
117	118		301									She takes a deep breath, looking incredibly serious.																						
118	119		301								Karenina	I won't change my decision.	1																					
119	120		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Karenina	Let me say it again: I have to blow up this place.	1
