6	6		301								Changyu	Feels good standing on the bow, doesn't it? I'm not feeling any wind, though. Can we get the captain to speed the ship up a little bit?	2																					
7	7		301								Sophia	...I'm swinging.	1																					
8	8		301								Changyu	By the way, I've heard of a thing called "figurehead" that's installed at the bow. Should we get one for this ship? I know a guy who can give you a twenty percent discount.	2

12	12		301							1	Pulao	Can't you two behave?!	1																					
13	13		301									Apart from the staff, three other Constructs are also present on the bridge of the Nighter. On one side are the two guests from Akdilek.																						
14	14		301									On the other side is Pulao, acting as a host from the ship.																						
15	15		301								Pulao	Sophia, get down from the fence! We have a telescope for observation purposes, so stop doing it with your eyes! We'll have to stop the ship to save you if you fall into the sea!	1																					
16	16		301								Pulao	And Changyu, stop tricking my people and have them sign your contracts! I'm not putting a weird statue in front of my ship!	1

21	21		202							1	2				1																			
22	22		301									The two return to the deck at Pulao's insistence, then they stare at her with a gaze that suggests she will need to offer some kind of alternative entertainment.

24	24		301							1	Pulao	I finally understand how hard it is to babysit children...	1

27	27		301							1	Changyu	You aren't that old yourself.	2																					
28	28		301								Sophia	If only Nanami were here. That would make four of us in the baby squad.	1

31	31		301							1	Pulao	I'm not joining any baby squad!	1

34	34		201							2	500124		400																					
35	35		301							1	Changyu	Because the Nighter signed a Sea Freight contract with Akdilek, duh.	2																					
36	36		201							2	500127		400																					
37	37		301							1	Sophia	And we're the guards of the cargo.	2																					
38	38		204							1	5																							
39	39		301								Pulao	I haven't seen you two doing any guarding...	1																					
40	40		201							2	500124	1	400																					
41	41		301							1	Changyu	Enough with this. Are you ready to do the call?	2																					
42	42		204							1																								
43	43		301								Pulao	Did you just... change the subject out of nowhere?	1																					
44	44		201							2	500127		400																					
45	45		301							1	Sophia	Let's head to the comms room.	2																					
46	46		204							1	5																							
47	47		301								Pulao	Hey, we're not moving on from our discussion yet! We're going to make some rules regarding your time on the Nighter!	1																					
48	48		202							1	2				1																			
49	49		301									Pulao draws her weapon and blocks the two of them from running away, her deadly gaze declaring how serious she is about making rules.																						
50	50		301									Confronted by her this way, Changyu and Sophia do not show any sense of uneasiness and stress. Instead, they stare back with great puzzlement.																						
51	51		201							1	500124		1																					
52	52		301							1	Changyu	Eh... No one likes that kind of attitude, Pulao.	1																					
53	53		201							1	500145	5																						
54	54		301							1	Pulao	You don't get to judge me!	1

56	56		201							2	500127		400																					
57	57		301							1	Sophia	Jamilah once told me a saying that goes, "carpe diem, seize the drink!" I happen to have a fancy bottle with me. Please seize it and pretend nothing's happened.	2																					
58	58		204							1																								
59	59		301								Pulao	That's not how the saying goes...	1																					
60	60		301									Still, Pulao takes the weird-looking bottle Sophia has hidden behind her despite complaining. She takes a large sip.																						
61	61		301								Pulao	...	1																					
62	62		204							1	5																							
63	63		301								Pulao	This is seawater!	1																					
64	64		301								Sophia	You just smashed the bottle on the ground...	2																					
65	65		301								Pulao	You tricked me! That's seawater!	1																					
66	66		301								Sophia	I said it was a fancy bottle, not a fancy drink... Anyway, it'll cost you 250, and no refund, because you broke the bottle.	2																					
67	67		301								Pulao	250? What kind of devil are you?	1																					
68	68		202							1	2				1																			
69	69		301									Absolutely defeated, Pulao falls to her knees, her face filled with loathing.																						
70	70		201							1	500145																							
71	71		301							1	Pulao	Sob... I said I couldn't handle the two of them... When are the rest of the Kowloong Crew coming back... Sob...	1

73	73		201							2	500124	1	400																					
74	74		301							1	Changyu	Hmm. You might have overdone it, Sophia.	2																					
75	75		301								Sophia	It seems so. Sorry, Pulao, we were just playing with you.	1																					
76	76		202							1	2				1																			
77	77		201							1	500145																							
78	78		301							1	Pulao	Huh?	1																					
79	79		201							1	500124	1																						
80	80		301							1	Changyu	We'll sort out your rules and our business on the Nighter together later. Now, take this candy, and come with us to make "the call"!	1																					
81	81		201							1	500145																							
82	82		301							1	Pulao	Ah... Okay, you're right. We should do that quickly while we're still connected.	1																					
83	83		301									She unwraps the candy and swallows it. Pulao is about to lead the two Akdilek Constructs to the comms room when they each grab one of her shoulders.
