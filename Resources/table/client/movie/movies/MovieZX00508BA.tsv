10	10		301							1	Lee	That's possible... But we don't have any more info for now.	3																					
11	11		301								Lee	At least for now, M.I.N.D. technology still seems to be impenetrable to the Corrupted here.	3																					
12	12		301								Lee	The special properties of consciousness make it so that the longer it is stored within a container, the more it deteriorates.	3																					
13	13		301								Lee	What these Corrupted can only do is to plunder and find new consciousnesses and connect them into these projection devices.	3																					
14	14		301								Lee	Then creating a virtual M.I.N.D. to display in real space with this roundabout way to observe and research it.	3

26	26		301							1	Lee	—From what I know, consciousness processing is much more difficult than it looks on paper. Only the top researchers in the Science Council have the prowess to fiddle with consciousnesses.	3																					
27	27		301								Lee	But there have not been cases of consciousness copying in Babylonia's database. Any form of consciousness meddling has been strictly forbidden by Humanity.	3
