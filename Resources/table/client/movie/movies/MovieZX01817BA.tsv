8	8		301								Arnold	Is this it?	2																					
9	9		301								Wanshi	Yup.	1																					
10	10		301								Arnold	This sure is some mighty fine craftsmanship.	2																					
11	11		301								Wanshi	Well... It came at the cost of a lot of research and sacrifice.	1																					
12	12		301								Arnold	I see. Guess it ain't easy being a Construct.	2																					
13	13		301								Arnold	I had no idea technology in the outside world had come this far.	2																					
14	14		301								Wanshi	Huh...? You don't know what's going on in the outside world?	1																					
15	15		301								Arnold	Don't know, don't care.	2																					
16	16		301								Arnold	I dunno how long it's been since I left society and started livin' by myself out here in no man's land.	2																					
17	17		301								Arnold	All I remember is openin' my hatch one day, and the whole world had changed.	2																					
18	18		301								Arnold	See this hand? I amputated it when it got infected and started to fester. That's why it's modified the way it is now.	2																					
19	19		301								Arnold	Luckily, this pile of protective gear only came at the cost of a hand.	2

29	28		301								Wanshi	?	1																					
30	29		301								Arnold	It's all right. Enough 'bout the past. I've long abandoned everything I once had.	2

32	31		301								Arnold	As for the protective equipment, it ain't as powerful as you, little buddy.	2																					
33	32		301								Arnold	I built this little guy out of scrap metal I picked up from the dump. There's just enough to keep me goin'.	2																					
34	33		301								Arnold	Me and my partner are like on an island cut off from the outside world.	2																					
35	34		301								Wanshi	I see...	1

38	37		202							1	2				1																			
39	38		301									Arnold stops his work and grabs a water bottle from the cabinet off to the side. He squeezes it into his mouth, but only a few drops dribble out.

51	50		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The surrounding environment suddenly changes. The dingy underground room becomes a spacious white city. The bricks and stones that built the city pour out from the ocean above, pass through Arnold and Wanshi, then splice into various buildings within the city.																						
52	51		301									The architecture changes styles continuously. In an instant, the city goes from magnificent European halls, to mottled urban ruins, then to a blood-red Dead Zone.																						
53	52		301									Light and shadows alternate rapidly in the city. The boundary between day and night begins to blur.																						
54	53		301									The white city continuously alters its shape. Refracted sunlight shines from above, unveiling a blue ocean of data behind it.																						
55	54		301									Various buildings and images reflect in the ocean, waiting for the two divers to give instructions.

61	60		301								Arnold	What's this? Is this what the city looks like now...? Is that the ocean up there?	2																					
62	61		301								Wanshi	Well... That's the data stream up there. It just looks like the ocean is all.	1																					
63	62		301									Arnold is stunned for a moment as he scans the changing scenery around him.																						
64	63		301								Wanshi	Survey work... Is tedious. So I asked someone to modify the projection recording function.	1																					
65	64		301								Wanshi	I can basically reproduce what I've seen from the data stream overhead.	1

78	77		301							1	Wanshi	Well... The old cities were mostly destroyed by the war.	1																					
79	78		301								Wanshi	So everyone basically lives in Babylonia.	1																					
80	79		301								Arnold	Babylonia... I thought it was only under development. Not that it was already finished.	2																					
81	80		301								Wanshi	Good thing you know about Babylonia. Saves me from having to explain it...	1																					
82	81		301								Arnold	That's amazing. Humans have ascended to the heavens.	2																					
83	82		301								Wanshi	The heavens...? I guess you could say so.	1																					
84	83		301								Wanshi	In short, human beings live, develop and proliferate in preparation to recapture Earth at every moment.	1

96	94		301								Arnold	You've thrown yourself into this war, and you ain't got an answer? Is it because you're lookin' for one?	2

103	100		301								Wanshi	Sick? You mean the Punishing Virus?	1																					
104	101		301								Arnold	No, the planet was sick long before that.	2																					
105	102		301								Arnold	The cities and societies of the past were all sick.	2																					
106	103		301								Arnold	Maybe the virus and monsters that are now spreading outside are punishment for the diseased society of the Golden Age.	2																					
107	104		301								Arnold	While mankind enjoys a prosperous life, it breeds a source of disease known as corruption and degeneration.	2																					
108	105		301								Arnold	Does humanity really need to return to this planet?	2																					
109	106		301								Arnold	Maybe we should focus on tomorrow instead of the hopeless things of the past.	2																					
110	107		301								Arnold	What's the point of sacrificin' so much to recover Earth?	2																					
111	521		204							1																								
112	108		301								Wanshi	I think it's so mankind can return to Earth one day.	1

117	113		301								Wanshi	Honestly... I've had my doubts on the collective goals of mankind for some time now...	1																					
118	114		301								Wanshi	Humanity's path to achieving their goals is paved in whitewashed lies. Yet we continue to work toward this goal.	1																					
119	115		301								Arnold	Hmph... Just like before, huh?	2																					
120	116		301								Wanshi	...I've never been determined to win at all costs like those around me.	1																					
121	117		301								Wanshi	In the long war, a ray of hope shines above every Construct. In order to win a menial victory, they use their own flesh and blood to pave the dark road to humanity's ultimate goal.	1																					
122	522		204							1	9																							
123	118		301								Wanshi	I've had countless dreams that humanity ended in tragic defeat. The flame had grown so weak, that darkness finally came. After a brief struggle, the mote was finally extinguished.	1																					
124	119		301								Wanshi	I have thought and tried. But now, I realize that personal efforts pale in significance when faced with our current reality.	1																					
125	120		301								Wanshi	I'm too exhausted to think about answers now...	1																					
126	523		204							2	1																							
127	121		301								Arnold	Isn't that perfect then? Use this time to abandon this rotten Earth?	2

137	128		301								Wanshi	My comrades look to each other with smiles of satisfaction. The civilization that humanity only spoke of once again becomes a reality.	1																					
138	129		301								Wanshi	We finally return to Earth and save ourselves.	1																					
139	130		301								Wanshi	Once confused, cowardly and wavering, I feel an unprecedented emotion standing before such a world... I feel an overwhelming sense of triumph and elation...	1																					
140	131		301								Arnold	But that was just a dream.	2																					
141	132		301								Arnold	I also imagined that humans of the Golden Age would regain their faith that was once so close at heart.	2																					
142	133		301								Arnold	But dreams will eventually be broken. Humanity is doomed to repeat past mistakes time and time again. Disease will only be followed by new disease.	2																					
143	134		301								Wanshi	You're right. We must all wake up from our dreams eventually. But in making our dreams come true, there is always something within my power.	1																					
144	135		202							1	2				1																			
145	136		301									Wanshi quickly switches the projection around Arnold. Countless bricks and stones form a war-torn battlefield.

156	146		301								Wanshi	Yeah... This way of life might be a little selfish...	1

158	148		301								Arnold	So what? Who cares.	2																					
159	149		301								Arnold	Everyone has their own way of living. You and me both.	2																					
160	150		301								Arnold	I was a loner during the Golden Age.	2																					
161	151		301								Arnold	When I came here to get far away from society, I knew the outside world would criticize me.	2																					
162	152		301								Arnold	But had I not left, I probably wouldn't even be here speakin' with you.	2																					
163	153		301								Arnold	Ain't no one got the right to talk **** about a life of selfishness. In the end, it just depends on your... Cough.	2
