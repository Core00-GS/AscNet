5	5		301									The singing of whale is so loud that it makes Pulao roll to the ground.																						
6	6		301									The hard floor helps Pulao to wake up. She holds on to the cabinet, finally reaching the whale-shaped alarm clock.																						
7	7		301									When the room is quiet again, Pulao finally gets rid of the drowsiness. She combs her hair with her hand and sighs at the messy bed.

9	9		301								Pulao	Sigh... I still can't get used to the morning alarm clock.	1																					
10	10		301								Pulao	Speaking of which, I haven't slept so well in a long time.	1																					
11	11		301								Pulao	Hehe. I feel like I had a great dream.	1																					
12	12		301								Pulao	There were many familiar people and things, but I can't remember...	1																					
13	13		204							1	2																							
14	14		301								Pulao	Whatever, the ending must be good. Otherwise, I wouldn't be smirking like this. I don't often do this!	1																					
15	15		301								Chaofeng	Wake up, Pulao. We need another round of patrol before the celebration starts.																						
16	16		301								Pulao	What, is it this late already?	1																					
17	17		301									Pulao quickly jumps off the bed and takes the coat of Pulao Crew from the wall.

19	19		301								Pulao	What's this...	1																					
20	20		301									When her fingers run through the "Pu" on her coat, a calming mechanoid flashes through her memory.																						
21	21		204							1	8																							
22	22		301								Pulao	It feels so familiar. But why the bitter feeling...	1																					
23	23		301								Yazi	Are you ready? I'm coming in.

31	31		301								Chaofeng	Don't push her, Pulao. Her face is always like this.	2																					
32	32		201							1	500445	5	400																					
33	33		301							1	Pulao	Fine. Speaking of which, can you stop hanging upside down? The children in the West District have complained quite a few times.	1																					
34	34		301								Chaofeng	Little brats...	2

36	36		301								Chiwen	Sir, our market research indicates your prune drink will continue to be very popular. Make sure you stock up on it.																						
37	37		201							1	500236																							
38	38		301							1	Shop Owner	Of course, I learned it from Uncle Fu. It would be a disgrace if people don't like my drinksâ€”how can I claim to inherit his techniques then?	1																					
39	39		301								Shop Owner	By the way, would you like to try some shacha noodles first?	1																					
40	40		301								Chiwen	Thanks, but I'm fine.

48	48		301								Chiwen	Mr. Simpie, please don't unload your goods at the intersection. Can you move them to the side? We have more ship-repairing materials coming through later.																						
49	49		301								Mr. Simpie	Let's get working, Birdie.																						
50	50		301								Birdie	Alright. One, two, three, go!																						
51	51		301								Mr. Simpie	Wanna go for a drink and performance after work? I heard the East District recently had a decent troupe of sword dancers.																						
52	52		301								Mr. Simpie	Let us treat you. After all, you gave us a hand when we were completely lost.																						
53	53		201							1	500445	1																						
54	54		301							1	Pulao	No thanks, today is just a beginning. There are still a lot to do in the days to come.	1																					
55	55		301								Mr. Simpie	Okay then. We look forward to continuing working with you next year.																						
56	56		301								Chiwen	Me too.																						
57	57		301								Pulao	Chiwen is always the busiest at the celebration.	1																					
58	58		202							1	2				1																			
59	59		301								Chiwen	We have the most trading activities going on at this time. It's better to be busy than sorry.																						
60	60		301								Chiwen	What is Bixi doing? He never gave me a logistics plan. I have to handle everything.																						
61	61		301								Bixi	Stop talking behind my back. I just reinforced all the equipment for tonight's performance. There is still a lot to fix on the ship.																						
62	62		301								Chiwen	Hmph.	1																					
63	63		301								Fuxi	Qiuniu, I finished the firework that you asked me. I only have limited materials, the end result may not meet your requirement...	1																					
64	64		301								Qiuniu	It's okay. We don't have a lot of supplies to waste. The entertainment budget is tight.	2

67	67		301							1	Yazi	Where are those 4 newbies in your team? I didn't see them with you today.	1																					
68	68		301								Pulao	Babylonia helped to end our torment. But we can only depend on ourselves from now on.	2																					
69	69		301								Pulao	To do so, work-life balance is very important. So I gave them a day off today.	2																					
70	70		201							1	500144		400																					
71	71		301							1	Chaofeng	You are thinking too much. I only want them to follow you so you don't get distracted by the toys and snacks.	1																					
72	72		204							2	5																							
73	73		301								Pulao	I won't!	2																					
74	74		301								Chaofeng	Really? But your panda wallet is full of Grubs.	1

83	83		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Pulao	Sure. After patrolling the dock, I'll also search a 10km radius. I may be back late.																						
84	84		301									Pulao waves goodbye to the other Kowloong Crew. The morning sun shines upon her hair, leaving a golden glow.																						
85	85		301									With a smile on her face, she turns around and starts the day's work.																						
86	86		301								Pulao	Chaofeng just had a late night and still has to patrol. Must not let down the guard when it comes to intelligence...																						
87	87		301								Pulao	Chiwen and Bixi haven't used the sleeping pod for two weeks.																						
88	88		301								Pulao	Not only the Dragon Children, everyone on the Nighter has been working hard since that day... It's been tough for all of us.																						
89	89		301								Pulao	No, it's not the time to be sentimental.																						
90	90		301								Pulao	I must help and understand others, and put everything into action!																						
91	91		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Pulao	Hmm... A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step! Here I go!

95	95		301								Huainan	Aren't you going to check it out? Perhaps you will bump into the old friends you miss!																						
96	96		301								Yin	If you want to see some old friends, you go yourself.																						
97	97		301								Yin	But I must warn you first. We are only going to cause unnecessary panic if we show up in public.																						
98	98		301								Huainan	Alas. Your "noble" Kowloong identity seems to cause more trouble now.																						
99	99		301								Yin	You said you were just going to glance from afar. Now let's go.																						
100	100		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Huainan	Okie dokie. Hope everyone has a wonderful New Year.
