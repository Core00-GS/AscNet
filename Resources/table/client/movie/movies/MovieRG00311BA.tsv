14	14		301								Villager	Stop bluffing. Your friends—the other group of "heroes"—just seized all the recovery potions of another village nearby! They claimed to have the King's order!	1

27	27		301								Lee	I can't rule out the possibility that Liv was there, but based on the response of these villagers, only Vera would do such thing...	2
