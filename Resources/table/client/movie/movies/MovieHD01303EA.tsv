6	6		301									Your team's strategy of maintaining constant communication seems to be almost on par with the Engineering Force, even with the help of their thrusters.																						
7	7		301									Only one component remains.

12	12		302								Ignore them, Lee.	13																						
13	13		301									One of the other Constructs stays behind and blocks Lee for a few seconds, giving the other Construct a chance to slip by the side of the cliff using the thrusters.																						
14	14		201							1	500019																							
15	15		301							1	Construct A	Should've expected such tactics from a combat team. Guess I learned a thing or two.	1																					
16	16		301									Even though Lee manages to juke the Construct blocking his way, the competition is still down to the wire.

22	22		301								Construct B	Looks like we got the upper hand this time.	2																					
23	23		301									After grabbing the last part, the Construct returns to her companion's side. She extends her hand in a gesture of sportsmanship.

35	35		302								We lost...	36																						
36	36		301			DialogEnable						You feel slightly annoyed with the other team for using high-speed support devices.																						
37	37		301									After all, the organizers probably didn't anticipate anyone going out of bounds and bypassing the side of the cliff. You feel helpless against their exploitation of a loophole.

44	44		301								Construct B	Did you mess up?	2																					
45	45		301								Construct A	How's that possible? Would you have messed up?	1																					
46	46		301									Faced with the explanation by the organizer's staff, the Constructs share looks of dismay.																						
47	47		301									They repeatedly check the objects on the table only to realize they accidentally grabbed a duplicate bolt.

51	51		301							1		At that moment, Lee hands in the items you have collected.																						
52	52		301									Surely enough, the last part lies in his palm.																						
53	53		301								Lee	Looks like I still have a trick up my sleeve from playing magician all day.	1																					
54	54		302								When you shook their hands?	55																						
55	55		301								Lee	Correct.	1																					
56	56		302								You weren't practicing beforehand, were you?	57																						
57	57		302								You seem a little too good at that.	58

64	64		204							1	10																							
65	65		301									After rubbing the center of his brow, he clenches his fist, shakes his wrist, and opens his fingers. An intricate robot instantly appears in the palm of his hand.

67	67		301									Lee opens a drawer stuffed with parts, ribbons, playing cards, and small robots of various shapes, and puts it in.																						
68	68		301									Then he casually picks up the paper in front of him, holds it by the edge, and folds it several times. The celebration flyer becomes an intricate origami rose.																						
69	69		301									Looking at the time, he furrows his eyebrows and quickly unfolds the paper with blistering speed.																						
70	70		301									Folding it again, but this time faster, he checks his time, then puts the "rose" in the drawer.																						
71	71		301									After moving his stiff joints, he takes out a bottle of lubricant and rubs it on his hands.																						
72	72		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lee	All that remains is...	1
