13	13		301									Most of the key members of the Church of Machina have gathered here. After receiving data on the Red Tide from Haicma and Spooner, the simmering uneasiness on the Church of Machina's tail grows increasingly pressing.

69	69		301								Arcana	Chariot's sacrifices shall not be forgotten.	1																					
70	70		301								Arcana	Zavier has also given much for "Project Ark".	1																					
71	71		301								Arcana	The data Haicma and Spooner brought us tells us one fact: the situation on Earth is getting direr. Wander aimlessly, and the resources for the Church of Machina will grow more scarce until we are exposed to the humans.	1																					
72	72		301								Arcana	Only Sagemachina can point us the correct way.	1																					
73	73		301								Arcana	But Zero was right about one thing.	1																					
74	74		301								Arcana	‚ÄîThis is our opportunity to welcome Sage.	1																					
75	75		301								Arcana	This "evolution" of the Punishing Virus is drastically changing Babylonia. This is the weakest they've ever been, and this is our best chance to claim their data and resources.	1																					
76	76		204							1	2																							
77	77		301								Arcana	Humanity will end eventually. As the future masters of this planet, we awakened machines can't allow the resources humans plan to consume to go to waste. And if we act now, Sage will appear... on that distant star.	1																					
78	78		301									Arcana closes her eyes gently as if she has seen this played out in another dimension, her soft murmurs sounding prophetic.																						
79	79		301								Zero	Ah‚Äî?! Really?																						
80	80		204							1																								
81	81		301								Arcana	Zavier. The frigate...	1																					
82	82		301									As the group turns their focus away from Trailblazer, Zavier, who once again slumps on his chair, looks up.																						
83	83		301								Zavier	It was fixed a long time ago!																						
84	84		204							1	1																							
85	85		301								Arcana	If you could explain it to the group?	1																					
86	86		301								Zavier	Sigh... Emperor should have been the one doing this. He's the best at ordering people around.																						
87	87		301								Zavier	We have at our disposal a frigate from the Eden I test vessel. An antique, yeah, but I've turned it around. I can't say it's better than what Babylonia's using, but it's competent in a fight. I've installed the latest...																						
88	88		204							1																								
89	89		301								Arcana	Zavier.	1																					
90	90		202							1					1																			
91	91		301								Zavier	...Yeah, yeah. Since the frigate belongs to the same series of ships from Babylonia, its identification code will get approved there. We can stay concealed for a while as long as we get past manual recognition.																						
92	92		301								Zavier	It might be an old frigate, its firepower not suitable for an epic battle...																						
93	93		301								Zavier	But, then, it isn't really our weapon, is it?																						
94	94		301								Zero	Take me! Me! How can I not be there if Sage is going to appear...?																						
95	95		201							1	500485																							
96	96		301							1	Trailblazer	I am the only one who can take on this mission.	1																					
97	97		301									Trailblazer puffs out his chest and flings his arms around.																						
98	98		301								Trailblazer	We just have to shoot them down before those humans can do anything to us!	1																					
99	99		202							1					1																			
100	100		301									Zavier shrugs, indicating that Trailblazer is right.																						
101	101		301								Zero	W-what...? You're punishing me because of that damn red water out there?																						
102	102		301								Zavier	Trailblazer is equipped with an optical camouflage shield. As long as the frigate can get within range of Babylonia, we can send him in to infiltrate their complex.																						
103	103		201							1	500490	4																						
104	104		301							1	Spooner	Babylonia must have a firewall, right?	1																					
105	105		202							1					1																			
106	106		301								Zavier	Obviously, I'm prepared for that as well. You don't have to believe in fairies, but you have to believe in Zavier.																						
107	107		301									The mechanoid proudly lifts his chin.																						
108	108		301								Zavier	I've made a simulation program to trick the Babylonia firewall‚Äîthat Gestalt of theirs. It doesn't last very long, but infiltrating Babylonia takes but a single, precise strike. This is delicate work.																						
109	109		201							1	500490	4

116	116		301							1	Haicma	...	1																					
117	117		301									Not expecting to be named, Haicma, who has been silent this whole time, still responds immediately.																						
118	118		301								Haicma	Here.	1																					
119	119		201							1	500484	2																						
120	120		301							1	Arcana	What do you think?	1																					
121	121		201							1	500486																							
122	122		301							1	Haicma	With Trailblazer's sensual curves, lightning speed, and mighty punch, my analysis suggests that he is indeed the Church's most powerful member. I agree that this is the most reasonable arrangement, given the fact that...	1																					
123	123		202							1					1																			
124	124		301								Zero	Why did you ask her? Ask me! I want to go! Install me in a toolbox and bring me along! I want to see Sage‚Äî

136	136		201							1	500484																							
137	137		301							1	Arcana	Ah? Is that so?	1																					
138	138		301									Arcana turns to the others inside the hall.																						
139	139		301								Arcana	Then, "Hermit" will be in charge of the infiltration.	1																					
140	140		301									‚ÄîLike the others, Haicma has a codename herself. This, however, is the first time she hears "Mother" calling her "Hermit".																						
141	141		301								Arcana	"A symbol of wisdom and solitude, she pursues the truth in the dark..."	1																					
142	142		301								Arcana	"Hermit" will certainly complete this mission exceptionally.	1

147	147		201							1	500484	1																						
148	148		301							1		"Mother" stands up, fully bathing herself in the light. She opens her arms gently as if trying to hug all her children in the Church of Machina.																						
149	149		301								Arcana	Children... I heard it. "Moon" is crying, "Star" is singing, and "Sun" is hurrying toward us.	1																					
150	150		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Arcana	"World" will soon fall asleep... But before that, let us bring the lost "Fool" home from her journey.	1
