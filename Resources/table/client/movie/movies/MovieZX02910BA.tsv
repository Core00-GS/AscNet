10	10		301								Field	Huh?	1																					
11	11		301									Noan was about to tell Field what he'd just heard about Field's dad but decided to drop the topic.																						
12	12		204							2																								
13	13		301								Noan	What did the doctor say?	2																					
14	14		301								Field	He said my immune system isn't working properly, which is why I come under the weather a lot more down here where it's wet and cold.	1																					
15	15		301								Field	Boy, I can't wait for summer.	1																					
16	16		301								Field	I won't be sick so often when summer is here... and Dad won't have to worry about me all the time.	1																					
17	17		301									Field rubs his fingers against the vial in his hand that comes with no label.																						
18	18		301								Field	This medicine... costs us a fortune.	1																					
19	19		301								Noan	...Does your dad stay connected with Ashlar to keep his access to this medicine?	2																					
20	20		301								Field	I have no idea... He refuses to tell me anything about it.	1																					
21	21		204							1	2																							
22	22		301								Field	Do you like summer, Noan?	1																					
23	23		301								Noan	I don't have a favorite season because it doesn't really make a difference on the train.	2																					
24	24		301								Noan	But I guess I just might have one when I eventually get to go out with the Cargo Crew.	2																					
25	25		301								Field	Cool. Say, why not let's go to the forest to look for fireflies in summer?	1																					
26	26		301								Noan	Fireflies? Why, though?	2																					
27	27		204							1																								
28	28		301								Field	Because... they're beautiful? Have you seen one?	1																					
29	29		301								Noan	In the books I read, yes. And I've drawn some before.	2																					
30	30		401							2	910																							
31	31		301									Noan picks up a pencil and, on a makeshift sketchbook he's put together using scrap papers, draws a vertical line of circles. The circles seem like a cross between dandelions and the glowing balls that one would see reading mangas.																						
32	32		402							910																								
33	33		301								Field	No, Noan. Fireflies don't actually look like this.	1																					
34	34		301									With his fingers, Field traces out a firefly.																						
35	35		301								Field	A firefly has a pair of wings, and the only part of it that glows is its tummy.	1																					
36	36		204							1	3																							
37	37		301								Field	We can try to look it up in the terminal, but I'm sure it wouldn't look as pretty in the pictures as if you see one in person.	1																					
38	38		301								Noan	Are there still any around?	2																					
39	39		301								Field	Yes. My mom brought me to this place to see them before. We should do that, too.	1																					
40	40		204							2	1																							
41	41		301								Noan	Sounds great. I can go out there with the Cargo Crew after my training.	2

44	44		301									Noan looks up and stares at the dusty lights affixed to the car's ceiling.																						
45	45		301								Noan	Fireflies, eh...	2																					
46	46		301								Noan	I heard a lullaby before that has to do with fireflies.	2																					
47	47		204							1	2																							
48	48		301								Field	A lullaby? Wait, do you mean this one?	1																					
49	49		301									Seeing Noan looking back at him with a bewildered look, Field hums out a part of what he believes is the lullaby Noan is talking about.																						
50	50		301								Noan	No, not this one.	2																					
51	51		204							1																								
52	52		301								Field	Hmm...	1

66	66		301								Noan	Think I read about that somewhere, but that's just a superstition from the past, no?																						
67	67		301								Field	Uhm, well...																						
68	68		301								Field	My mom would always describe us as grass with our roots deep in the soil, but she never told me why she thought that...

75	75		201							1	500512	2																						
76	76		301							1	Field	...We're as mundane as grass. See, this is what it says in the book. "Wild grass strikes no deep roots, has no beautiful flowers and leaves, yet it imbibes dew, water and the blood and flesh of the dead, all trying to rob them of life."	1																					
77	77		301								Field	"As long as it lives, it is trampled upon and mown down, until it dies and decays."	1																					
78	78		301								Field	...But that doesn't mean wild grass is worthless.	1																					
79	79		301								Field	"You die because you lived, and you rot because you were. Dying weeds bear new lives, and while the skies might not be at their brightest now, the fire burning across the grassfield will light up the skies all the same."	1																					
80	80		301								Field	It all makes sense, then, what people say about grass turning into fireflies when it withers and decays—because people can't stop missing something when it's gone, no matter how mundane it might be.	1																					
81	81		204							1

88	88		204							1	2																							
89	89		301								Field	Well, because I was just reading this book, and because "goodbye" keeps coming up... in that lullaby you brought up.	1																					
90	90		301								Field	So I thought of my mom—and how she might have turned into a firefly and might just be waiting for me out there in the forest to say "goodbye" to me.	1																					
91	91		204							1																								
92	92		301								Noan	...	2																					
93	93		301								Field	Does it all sound like some fantasy I made up to make myself feel better?	1																					
94	94		301								Noan	No, it doesn't.	2																					
95	95		301								Noan	But, see, I was just thinking... that if people do turn into fireflies when they die, then we'd never have to say goodbye to them, right?	2																					
96	96		204							1	14																							
97	97		301								Field	...	1																					
98	98		301								Field	I'm just trapped in my memory and the night—and maybe I just need to bid farewell to myself.	1																					
99	99		204							1																								
100	100		301								Noan	Why would you have to do that, though?	2																					
101	101		204							1	14																							
102	102		301								Field	...I'm responsible for my mom's death...	1																					
103	103		301								Field	She'd always encourage me to read, but we didn't have a whole lot of books at home. The terminal at the pharmaceutical factory had a lot of electronic documents in it, so she'd take me there every so often at night when there wasn't anyone around.	1																					
104	104		301								Field	And things went terribly wrong that night...	1																					
105	105		301									Field looks down in silence as he turns the pages in the book he's holding—and only opens his mouth to speak again after what seems like an eternity.																						
106	106		301								Field	Since Mom died... there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret it...	1																					
107	107		301								Field	And Dad has been living on the edge ever since to get me my medicine... all while I've been living in the melancholy of the past and been anything but helpful.	1																					
108	108		301								Field	If I could just say goodbye to her in the forest where she died, would I be able to let it all go and have what it takes to carry on?	1																					
109	109		204							1																								
110	110		301									Noan shakes his head.																						
111	111		301								Noan	She made that choice to protect you—and I'm sure she'd never want you to forget about her, and I'm also sure she'd never want to see you crippled by regret.	2																					
112	112		204							1	14																							
113	113		301								Field	...You're absolutely right, but I'm just too scared to face it. I can't do it.	1																					
114	114		204							1																								
115	115		301								Field	I just can't be like you, Noan. You've lost so much coming so far, but you've never given up.	1																					
116	116		301								Noan	...Huh? What do you mean?	2																					
117	117		301									Noan doesn't understand those words—because he thinks he's learned things the hard way and already come to grips with reality.																						
118	118		301								Field	Be it your memory or what you believe in, you hold on to them both.	1																					
119	119		301								Field	You'd never have stood up for me or lent me a hand had you already given them up.	1																					
120	120		301									Field puts his now slightly cold hand on Noan's shoulder.																						
121	121		301								Field	Deep down, you're deep into those heroic stories, aren't you?	1																					
122	122		204							2	3																							
123	123		301								Noan	...None of them is real, though.	2																					
124	124		301								Field	That's only because you don't yet have the power to make them so, Noan, and not because you aren't determined enough.	1																					
125	125		204							2																								
126	126		301								Noan	What's the difference anyways?	2																					
127	127		301								Field	Power corrupts you if power is all you have.	1																					
128	128		301								Field	But you're different. You went out of your way to help me knowing full well you were no match for the guard... and that, Noan, is determination.	1																					
129	129		301								Noan	Determination, huh...	2																					
130	130		301								Noan	But I was this close to screwing everyone over back then, and Rachel asked me to swear that I'd never do it again... if I ever come across something like that.	2																					
131	131		301								Field	Noan...	1																					
132	132		203							1	0.25	200																						
133	133		301									Field walks up to Noan and pats Noan's face.																						
134	134		301								Noan	...Yes?	2																					
135	135		204							1	2																							
136	136		301								Field	C'mon, Noan...	1																					
137	137		301								Field	I know you might be feeling guilty for putting everyone in harm's way, but nothing changes the fact that you saved me... and that's proof enough that you can still do what you want to do even when you don't yet have what it takes to make it perfect.	1																					
138	138		301								Field	And I'll keep what you did for me in mind—and help people in need when I see them.	1																					
139	139		301								Field	You might not be able to help everyone out there who's in need of help, but everyone you help will go on to help someone else. Sounds great, right?	1																					
140	140		301								Noan	...	2																					
141	141		301								Noan	Would you still do it if helping them means you're going to make everyone suffer?	2																					
142	142		301								Field	Sure. I mean, kindness is a choice, and the world is to blame if it doesn't allow us to make that choice.	1																					
143	143		301								Field	And that reminds me of what you said that day when you came up to help—"If you think I'm out of my mind for trying to help, then screw that!"	1																					
144	144		204							2	3																							
145	145		301								Noan	...Boy, you really need to forget that.	2																					
146	146		204							2																								
147	147		301								Field	Uhm? Why, though?	1																					
148	148		204							1	3

152	152		301								Noan	...	2																					
153	153		301								Field	Bingo? Oops.	1																					
154	154		301								Noan	Dude, just pretend I've never said any of that already...	2																					
155	155		204							1																								
156	156		301								Field	Hah...	1																					
157	157		301								Field	Ok, fine. I'll stop with that, but I'm never going to forget you helped me.	1																					
158	158		301								Field	And, see, it's really got me thinking, and I think I'm going to help people however I can once my leg gets better.	1																					
159	159		204							2	1																							
160	160		301								Noan	...But you're already doing that, Field. You're helping me already.	2																					
161	161		301								Field	Uhm? Am I?	1																					
162	162		204							2	3																							
163	163		301								Noan	You are. See...	2																					
164	164		301									Noan suddenly recalls all the things people have said about Field, and he can't help feeling tormented when he compares them with all the heart-warming encouragements he's heard from Field over the past few days.																						
165	165		301									Drawing a deep breath in hesitation, Noan decides to sweep it all under the carpet with thanks.																						
166	166		301								Noan	Thank you, Field. for telling me all this...	2																					
167	167		204							1	3

191	191		301								Noan	...You really love summer, don't you?	2																					
192	192		301								Field	With a burning passion, too, because it's only when summer is here that I don't get sick all the time.	1
