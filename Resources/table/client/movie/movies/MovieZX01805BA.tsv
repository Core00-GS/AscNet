15	15		301								Ayla	I think so. Not everyone evacuated during Operation Acadia. There's bound to still be people on the surface.																						
16	16		301								Ayla	Don't our textbooks say that there were billions of people on the surface at one point?																						
17	17		301								???	Billions? There's no way Babylonia could support that many people...

128	128		301								Lucia	It's a bastion for humanity's strongest—	2																					
129	129		301								Old Man	No. That's not what I asked. I mean what was Babylonia before the Punishing Virus and the Great Evacuation?	1																					
130	130		301								Lucia	It was humanity's first FTL colonization ship.	2																					
131	131		301								Old Man	Then why hasn't it taken you all into deep space?	1																					
132	132		301								Lucia	Because we lost Earth and want to take it back.	2																					
133	133		301								Old Man	Why do you want to take it back?	1																					
134	134		301								Lucia	...	2																					
135	135		301								Lucia	Our mission is to take back humanity's homeland.	2																					
136	136		301								Lucia	That is our mission. That is the meaning of our existence.	2																					
137	137		301								Old Man	But this homeland is no longer of any use to you.	1																					
138	138		301								Old Man	Cities destroyed; civilizations collapsed. Earth is now just a sea of ruins.	1																					
139	139		301								Old Man	Babylonia floats above Earth, just like we stand here in these ruins. Why not leave?	1																					
140	140		301								Old Man	Have you ever thought that taking back Earth might be meaningless?	1																					
141	141		301								Old Man	Now you are a Construct, not a human being. You don't need to inherit the meaning of human existence.	1

145	145		301								Lucia	...	2																					
146	146		301								Old Man	Much like how people should live, but they shouldn't just "live." There are far more important things than to "just live."	1

154	154		301								Old Man	Exactly. This is the path we chose, and this is the meaning we give our lives.	1																					
155	155		301								Old Man	We have nothing left. Our only driving force left is our attachment to this land. It's the only thing that supports our menial existence.	1																					
156	156		301								Old Man	Our last wish is to forever rest within its embrace.	1																					
157	157		301								Old Man	You think we're unreasonable choosing to die rather than to leave. I think you're being equally unreasonable.	1																					
158	158		301								Old Man	The irony of man. People can never reach a real mutual understanding.	1
