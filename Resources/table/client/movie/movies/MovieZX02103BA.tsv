5	5		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The transport craft lifts off at the speed of a rocket. The number on the altimeter climbs; by the time you soar above the clouds, moonlight floods the windshields as if welcoming you to a whole new world.																						
6	6		301									And yet, you are in no mood to appreciate the scenery or to celebrate being free.																						
7	7		301									Your body is hit by a massive force several times your weight from the thrust. It presses against your chest, making it hard for you to breathe.																						
8	8		301									The old wound below your chest aches once more, while your stomach feels like it's being tossed around. It has been quite some time since you last ate, fortunately. You would have thrown up already otherwise.																						
9	9		301									Vera might be an exceptional fighter, but an excellent pilot she is not.																						
10	10		301									The acceleration has barely affected the Construct. Glancing at you, Vera sees your pale, wrinkled face, and instead of her usual mockery, she makes a quiet "Tch" before pulling up the craft for an easier climb angle.																						
11	11		301									She has not slowed down the aircraft, however. The dots representing your pursuers are still behind you on the radar, the Mach number on the monitor rising with a clattering sound.																						
12	12		201							1	500168																							
13	13		301							1	Vera	Tough it out. We're fleeing right now. I don't have time to worry about your physical condition.	1

15	15		301									—That is what you wanted to ask Vera, but you barely have the strength to open your mouth right now.

17	17		301									Your pursuers' dots on the radars, however, are disappearing one by one.																						
18	18		301									It seems that the Kurono forces are not as persistent as you have thought... Something does not line up, but you will have to worry about that later.																						
19	19		301									You tilt your head slightly and notice Vera's striking profile.																						
20	20		301									Unlike everyone else you know, she has never treated you with kindness. If anything, she has directly or indirectly clashed with your team on occasion.																						
21	21		301									Still—helpless and alone, your only option right now is to trust her.

31	31		301									Because you find yourself lying down in the cabin when you open your eyes again.																						
32	32		301									Vera kneels next to you, her hand holding up an IV drip. A tube connects the bag in her hand to the needle attached to the vein on the back of your hand.																						
33	33		301									You feel a breeze over your chest. Looking down, you find Vera's other hand resting there. She seems to have been examining your conditions while you were out.																						
34	34		301									Noticing that you are awake, she lifts her hand slightly, her fingertip gliding to the side along your ribcage from the center of your chest before pressing down with a slight force.																						
35	35		301			RImgBg1Shake						The piercing pain makes you curl up involuntarily. Immediately, your body shoots up, and you sit on the floor, Vera's hand sliding off you.																						
36	36		201							1	500168

39	39		301									She throws the IV bag to you before heading back to the cockpit.																						
40	40		301									The fluids in the IV bag are almost empty. You must have been injected quite a while ago.																						
41	41		301									Removing the needle and wiping away the blood where it was attached, you find yourself much more spirited when you stand up.																						
42	42		301									The plane is on autopilot right now. The low hum of the engine gently rocks you in a way that feels comforting.																						
43	43		301									The radar is clear. Vera seems to have shaken off your pursuers long ago.																						
44	44		301									She is sitting on the pilot seat now, polishing her long sword quietly.																						
45	45		302								What exactly is going on?	46	You performed first-aid on me?	49

49	49		201							1	500168																							
50	50		301							1		She raises a brow, seemingly surprised that this is your first question.																						
51	51		301								Vera	I did, yes.	1																					
52	52		301								Vera	What's with the look? Do you not believe that I'd do it, or do you think I'd do a piss-poor job of it?	1																					
53	53		301								Vera	Don't worry. I didn't put a bomb inside you if that's what you're wondering. We'll table that idea.	1																					
54	54		302								Thanks.	55																						
55	55		301									Vera's eyes widen for just a little bit. She narrows them again immediately and teases you.																						
56	56		204							1	1																							
57	57		301								Vera	Do you think a simple "thanks" is enough?	1																					
58	58		301								Vera	I saved your life, after all. You should present something more important as a token of gratitude, shouldn't you?	1

62	62		301									Her blade swings toward you right as you stop speaking.																						
63	63		301									She holds the spine of her sword to your neck, lifting your chin ever so slightly.																						
64	64		301									The deadly weapon in her hand looks more like a cat wand that teases you right now.																						
65	65		301									You cannot tell if she is being serious or simply joking.																						
66	66		301								Vera	Like you yourself.	1																					
67	67		301									Seeing your dumbfounded expressions, Vera grins mischievously.																						
68	68		301								Vera	Don't take it the wrong way. It's just that everyone's trying to get a piece of you when I'm holding you right here.	1																					
69	69		301									The spine of her blade slightly "grates" your chin.																						
70	70		301								Vera	What a predicament. Don't you think I can trade you for anything I want right now?	1																					
71	71		302								...	72	You won't.	74																				
72	72		301								Vera	(Laughs) I wish you could see your face right now.	1

75	75		301								Vera	What a humdrum response.	1																					
76	76		204							1	1																							
77	77		301								Vera	I recommend against trusting someone like me so blindly.	1																					
78	78		301								Vera	I'm not the kind and loving type like those on your squad.	1																					
79	79		302								How about those on yours?	80																						
80	80		204							1																								
81	81		301									Her grin instantly disappears. Expressionless, she retracts her blade and sheaths it, the sound it makes almost piercingly painful.																						
82	82		301									It does not seem like she is going to answer you, but it is not difficult for you to imagine what No. 21 and Noctis are going through right now.																						
83	83		301								Vera	Enough with that expression. It's repulsive.	1																					
84	84		301								Vera	My team isn't some loser squad like yours. They will take care of themselves.	1																					
85	85		202							1					1																			
86	86		301									Despite her words, her slightly furrowed brows have nonetheless revealed her worry.																						
87	87		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Just like how you are missing the Gray Raven, Vera must be feeling the same thing even when she refuses to show it before you.																						
88	88		401							1	10																							
89	89		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						There is only silence between you once again.																						
90	90		301									The sky, the clouds, and even the ocean are dull gray outside the porthole.																						
91	91		301									The machine-like coldness fills your field of view.																						
92	92		301									The aircraft you are on becomes the only "living thing" in this monotonous world, tearing through the sky toward the horizon.																						
93	93		401							1	12																							
94	94		301									As your vision gets tired from the unchanging view, a small spike-shaped shadow pierces through the ocean surface in the distance. It appears so abruptly that the shock has you fully awake.																						
95	95		301									A second spike, and then a third one... Gradually they unveil before you.																						
96	96		301									Like witnessing the sunrise, something spectacular and overwhelming rises from behind the horizon and reveals itself.																						
97	97		301									What rises is not a star, however. It is a man-made structure so breathtaking that it might as well be a miracle.																						
98	98		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The shadow looms larger and larger. Before you realize it, you are already gasping in awe.

101	101		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Six metallic-gray spires form a giant circle on the ocean, surrounding the taller, seventh spire in the center. Just the sheer size of the shadow this group of structures cast is enough to humble you.																						
102	102		301									Verne's Mysterious Island could not hold a candle to this floating fortress even if it were real.																						
103	103		301									You can hardly describe your reverence with words. You imagine this is what western colonists felt when they first encountered the Mayan pyramids in the American forest.																						
104	104		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You instinctively hold your breath, stopping yourself from gasping again, fearing that any sound would awake whatever slumbers here.

108	108		301									Vera has only the slightest shift in her body when she lays eyes on it. Immediately she refocuses and heads for the display in front of the pilot seat, calibrating.																						
109	109		301								Vera	You see that red beacon?																						
110	110		301									You look toward where she is regarding and notices a red beacon floating in the water, a cube-shaped crate tied beneath it near the seaborne city's landing pad.																						
111	111		301									Looking drastically different from the cold and silent city it swims beside, the beacon is easily noticeable.																						
112	112		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Vera	That's an airdropped beacon from the Chief Commander.

118	118		301								Vera	We took a Kurono aircraft. Don't you think they'll try to track this plane's signal once they snap out of their snafu?	1																					
119	119		301								Vera	I'll enter a new destination for the plane's autopilot system, but this will only delay Kurono for a bit. Once they track down its wreckage and pull up its track record, they'll find us, sooner or later.	1																					
120	120		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Vera	So stop standing there like an idiot and go find a chute. We're jumping.	1

126	126		502							RImgBg1BlowUp																								
127	127		301									Yes. "A" parachute.																						
128	128		301									Vera fastens you to her with a harness as if you are a novice skydiver, and you descend at the same time.																						
129	129		301								Vera	Given the landing spot is only the size of the landing pad, I didn't want you to land in the ocean. I don't need the extra work saving you from drowning.																						
130	130		301									You have had parachuting training, but you must admit that Constucts' artificial skin is way more sensitive to airflow and wind direction. Their reaction and response speed is also unrivaled by humans.																						
131	131		301									Controlling the steering toggles, Vera guides the two of you to the landing pad slowly and precisely.																						
132	132		301									The city was impressive when you observed it from up high in a distance. As you descend, its shape becomes clearer and clearer.																						
133	133		301									It is like an amalgamation of a fortress, a pyramid, a city, and a mountain range, but it is also so much more.																						
134	134		301									There is nothing in real life that can compare to its majesty and mystery. It looks more like a myth realized by humans with science and technology—a legend that has come alive.																						
135	135		301									—Atlantis, resting upon the Atlantic Ocean.																						
136	136		301									Like the lost city in those stories, it is a "ruin" without a sign of life. There is no activity you can detect here—no sound, light, electromagnetic wave, radiation, heat signature... Nothing.																						
137	137		301									Far to the east, dark, menacing thunderclouds are heading toward you. They block the sun with their enormous mass and cast a giant shadow where you are.																						
138	138		301									A better metaphor appears in your head.																						
139	139		301									A grave.

146	146		401							2	721																							
147	147		301									With her impressive strength, she ties the crate that is twice her size with the string soon after before pulling it up to the landing pad.																						
148	148		301									The crate is an airdrop capsule with the logo of the World Government printed outside. You are familiar with it—supply crates like this were airdropped from Babylonia back when you were fighting on the surface.																						
149	149		301									Except this one has a few characters laser engraved underneath the World Government logo.																						
150	150		301									GARNET.																						
151	151		301									What does that mean?																						
152	152		201							1	500168

162	162		301									You complete the retina scan and confirm your identity.																						
163	163		301									With the sound of gears turning, the supply crate opens up from the middle, its covers unfolding to the sides.																						
164	164		301									A frame that looks identical to Vera's appears before you.																						
165	165		302								What is this?	166	Is this your backup frame?	166																				
166	166		301									Vera does not answer you. She just stares at her other self in silence.																						
167	167		301									"It" lies quietly within the crate like a blade in its sheath or a rose frozen in time—except each of its petals is stained with blood.																						
168	168		301									An unmanned frame is a non-living thing, after all. But the lack of humanity is what makes it appear even more beautiful and deadly.																						
169	169		201							1	500168																							
170	170		301							1	Vera	...We're using this frame, huh? How "generous" of you, Chief Commander.	1																					
171	171		202							1					1																			
172	172		301									She walks to the frame, her hands on the capsule, her head lowered.																						
173	173		301									All her usual sharp edges seem to vanish at this moment. Looking at the frame, she has shades of her past reflected in her eyes.																						
174	174		301									Except that past does not seem to contain any good memories. Shrouded all over her is a more dreadful sentiment.																						
175	175		301									Vera's red hair drapes down, tangled with the red hair of the lifeless construct in the capsule.																						
176	176		301									And then—																						
177	177		201							1	500168	1																						
178	178		301							1	Vera	Are you going to keep staring when I "change"?	1																					
179	179		301									She looks at you from the corner of her eyes, her gaze and tone playful.

184	185		301								Vera	Are you pretending you don't understand me?	1																					
185	186		301								Vera	I didn't realize that the Gray Raven Commandant is into this sort of thing. Do you also look at your squad change typically?	1																					
186	187		202							1					1																			
187	188		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You finally recognize what Vera is talking about and turn around instantly.																						
188	189		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Moments later.																						
189	190		301								Vera	It's done.																						
190	191		301									You turn around.																						
191	192		301									You find Vera in her new frame holding her original one horizontally.																						
192	193		301									What seems to be a peculiar scene originally is strangely beautiful in a way.																						
193	194		301									Vera places her original frame back into the capsule and stretches.																						
194	195		201							1	500345																							
195	196		301							1	Vera	The frame is well-adjusted. I should be able to continue the mission right away.	1																					
196	197		302								Is this an old frame?	198	Is this a new frame?	199																				
197	198	200	301								Vera	Indeed.	1																					
198	199		301								Vera	Obviously not. Would I be able to adjust to it so quickly if it's new?	1																					
199	200		301								Vera	It's an old frame I've only used a couple of times in the past. It doesn't leave the closet except for special circumstances.	1																					
200	201		204							1	13																							
201	202		301								Vera	After all, even my Support-type frame is far superior on the battlefield to those losers.	1																					
202	203		301									Right as she says that, the comms you both forgot about in the supply crate light up.

209	210		301							1		She turns it on without much of a second thought. Nikola's projection appears before the two of you.																						
210	211		301									It is a prerecorded message instead of a real-time call, however.																						
211	212		301									Nikola's gaze in the recording lands directly on Vera as if he has anticipated her standing right in front of him when he recorded it.																						
212	213		301								Nikola	Good job, Vera. I know you won't disappoint me.	1

220	221		301									This time, he is not "conversing" with Vera. He is talking to you.																						
221	222		301								Hassen	If you are seeing this, then the Cerberus captain has successfully rescued you from Kurono. So allow me to say this—	1																					
222	223		301								Hassen	I'm glad to see you safe and sound, 【kuroname】.	1																					
223	224		301								Hassen	If I had time, I would've loved to explain everything to you. The truth behind everything you have been through so far.	1																					
224	225		301								Hassen	But my time is running out, and so is yours. You must have realized by now the lengths Kurono would go to keep you in their grasp.	1																					
225	226		301								Hassen	They didn't even blink when they tried to sneak you away right under our nose after making a deal with us.	1																					
226	227		301								Hassen	They never planned to let you go whether the search for the agent succeeded or not. We have anticipated that, of course. I apologize for not cluing you in earlier—it would've only burdened you should the moment arise.	1																					
227	228		301								Hassen	Not to mention that you have already noticed one thing through this event...	1																					
228	229		301									Hassen's gaze turns more profound, but he does not seem like finishing his line.
