6	6		301								Nikola	Specialized frame and a specialized Inver-Device... We finally have some measurable results. Chrome never disappoints.	1																					
7	7		301								John	You look delighted.	2																					
8	8		301								Nikola	If we can create more Constructs that don't rely on a commandant with this technology... I suppose the odds will start going in our favor.	1																					
9	9		301								John	...	2																					
10	10		301								Nikola	I've got a meeting coming, so I have to go now. I'm guessing you've been waiting here to see your son return safely from that battlefield?	1																					
11	11		301								John	That won't be necessary now that I know the frame has been adapted successfully.	2

16	16		301									Of course they are plenty. There cannot be just one.																						
17	17		301									Anyone can grab a sword and face the monster. Anyone who does so is a hero.																						
18	18		301									They either perish on their way to the monster or die under its blade.																						
19	19		301									Before the monster is vanquished, no one will remember the names of the dead heroes. No one needs to.																						
20	20		301									But then one of the heroes takes a stand, and he declaresâ€”																						
21	21		301									"I will carry their names and fight."

26	26		301								John	He disobeyed my order, but when he called me Dad, I felt... glad.	1

29	29		301									It has never been a kite that needs an anchor in his hands, but an eagle with its wings spread, ready to fly.																						
30	30		301									The little boy standing in the shadows of the dark room back then has long left his nest.																						
31	31		301									He knows how the story of a Smith ends.																						
32	32		301									But he has no idea where this eagle will go.																						
33	33		301									Maybe he will find the answer all Smiths have been searching for.																						
34	34		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Maybe he will finally grasp what no Smith has dared to dream.
