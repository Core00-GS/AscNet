20	20		301								Karenina	Can't believe how messy this whole situation is.	2																					
21	21		301								Karenina	Then, should we... go after the Ascendant? Or continue our mission?	2

23	23		301								Kamui	(Announce his thoughts loudly) I've seen with my own eyes how the antigen affected Roland and the Punishing Virus...	1																					
24	24		204							1																								
25	25		301								Kamui	Nanami said Roland's still inside the Golden Vortex... Think about it. He's barely hanging on, but he's still staying here. If you ask me, I bet he's here for one reason—to destroy the antigen.	1																					
26	26		301								Karenina	That makes sense. The Ascendants wouldn't allow the antigen to threaten them.	2																					
27	27		301								Karenina	The antigen is still a rogue element right now—no one has weaponized it yet. If I were Roland, I'd be mad anxious.	2																					
28	28		301								Kamui	Before its weaponization, the Ascendants will do whatever it takes to destroy the antigen.	1																					
29	29		301								Karenina	Although it isn't stable, it's still going to help Earth out in a huge way.	2																					
30	30		301								Kamui	You're right. We can't let Roland destroy it.	1

43	43		301							1	Nanami	This golden circle can control the guards...	2																					
44	44		301								Nanami	Nanami is going to hack it and finds out which guards have been taken down by Roland! Then we just have to follow the bodies!	2

49	49		301								Kamui	As long as Roland's in the Golden Vortex, the guards here are going to find him before we do! They're going to leave a lot of bodies behind when they fight—finding the bodies means finding Roland!	1
