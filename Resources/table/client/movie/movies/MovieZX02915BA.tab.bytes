63	63		301									She repeats her words.																						
64	64		301								Rachel	Cargo Crew was a disorganized mess. Teams would fight with each other to get a larger share and a safer assignment.	2																					
65	65		301								Rachel	I wanted to change that, but I had nothing but my fists. I only had one belief‚ÄîI could fight my way out of this.	2																					
66	66		301								Rachel	Obviously, a stupid idea like that didn't get me anywhere. Every time I wanted to start something, the aristocrats would make me pay. When they were about to kick me off the train... Julie saved me.	2																					
67	67		301								Noan	Mom?	1																					
68	68		301								Rachel	Yeah. She just met your father back then. She became his secretary by being the hardworking badass she was.	2																					
69	69		301								Rachel	She couldn't stand the turmoil of the lower level, so she reached out to me... We talked, over and over, until we found the only way through‚ÄîAshlar.	2																					
70	70		301								Rachel	Speaking of which, your father was the one who introduced us. He brought me to the man who wanted to replace the aristocrat, and Ashlar and I made a deal.	2																					
71	71		301								Rachel	I scared the aristocrats who wouldn't work with him through the armed disturbances on the lower level, and he gave me connections and supplies to unite the people against the upper level.	2																					
72	72		301								Rachel	After our many successes, folks started treating me like an undefeatable "hero" and put me in charge of the Cargo Crew.	2																					
73	73		301								Rachel	Anyone could ask me for help because an upper-level aristocrat with actual power was standing behind me.	2																					
74	74		204							2	13																							
75	75		301								Rachel	Ironic, right? But I didn't have to worry. I could deal with anything.	2

89	89		301									Noan's vision suddenly distorts and turns into a foggy harbor. Lithos is holding his hand, patiently guiding his move.																						
90	90		301									This is the memory of Noan waking up not long after becoming a Construct. He has forgotten who he is and what Ascendants are.																						
91	91		301									He is simply trusting this other person wholeheartedly, the person who has stood by him and told him "every" secret.																						
92	92		301								Lithos	Give it a shot. You can even bring the law and order of the Golden Age to them. They'll move things, rebuild ruins...	2

98	98		301									Holding Noan's hands, Lithos points them at the crooked Constructs.																						
99	99		301								Lithos	Let them do what you want to do and save who you want to save...	2																					
100	100		301								Lithos	Free yourself from that harrowing powerlessness and become a real "hero."	2

103	103		301								Lithos	What is it?	2																					
104	104		301								Noan	You never told me what the price of this power is.	1																					
105	105		301									Thinking back, Noan supposes his instinctual alertness as a "merchant" must have prevailed.																						
106	106		204							2																								
107	107		301								Lithos	I just need you to become one of us... Not a lot of people can pass the filtering. I cherish you, and I want you to stay.	2

122	122		301									Noan's vision jumps to the night before the fight once again. Rachel sits before her desk, sneering at her glass self-mockingly.																						
123	123		301									Looking at this scene, Noan notices a sense of danger amidst the uneasiness‚Äîthere are only seven hours left until the upcoming battle. Why is Rachel still drinking and chatting with Assad?																						
124	124		301								Rachel	We were just tasked to take care of some jerks and their shady businesses initially. Then, innocent folks started getting involved.	2																					
125	125		204							2																								
126	126		301								Rachel	Until one day, Ashlar asked me to take care of your father... because he'd started to "misbehave" too.	2

129	129		204							2																								
130	130		301								Rachel	I didn't realize Ashlar had bought a few other reckless fools apart from us. Had I known, I would have protected Julie if nothing else... Your father, too.	2																					
131	131		301								Rachel	It's too late to say anything now. Her face was scarred in the end, and she landed on the lower level with you still inside her belly.	2																					
132	132		204							2	14																							
133	133		301								Rachel	Then she started to change... The stories she loved and the dreams she believed in were all hidden underneath her mask without a trace.	2																					
134	134		301								Rachel	To get a chance to fight back and free us from Ashlar's control... she agreed with my idea to manipulate the books in order to gather weapons for the Cargo Crew.	2																					
135	135		204							2																								
136	136		301								Rachel	...You realized that long ago, didn't you? Or someone told you?	2					1

140	140		204							2	14																							
141	141		301								Rachel	I know I shouldn't trust Shauna and Weyland to hide anything from you.	2																					
142	142		301									She sighs, staring at the murky liquid inside her glass.																						
143	143		301								Rachel	Julie was different from me or Assad. She wasn't born to be a bad guy. She had been on edge ever since she started tempering with the numbers.	2																					
144	144		301								Rachel	She said you ought to hang with other people, but she would start panicking the second you stepped out of sight.	2																					
145	145		301								Noan	Was that why she agreed to let me stay in the book storage room?	1																					
146	146		301								Rachel	Yeah. I told her to keep you around if she was worried, but she was afraid of how you'd react if her crime was exposed after you two got close.	2																					
147	147		301								Rachel	She would tell herself that she was doing it for everyone's future as if needing to convince herself. Then she'd start thinking about how you'd survive after she was gone.	2																					
148	148		301								Rachel	She would worry that you spent too much time drawing instead of learning a skill that could keep you fed and alive. That was why she was always so strict with you.	2																					
149	149		301								Rachel	But deep down... she wished you got to do what you love‚Äîbe it reading, drawing, or being with the people you like.	2																					
150	150		204							1	14																							
151	151		301								Noan	...She once told me, "I hope you get to become who you want to be."	1																					
152	152		204							2																								
153	153		301								Rachel	Did she, now? I should leave you with a word or two, then‚Äîwhatever future you want, don't make the mistakes I've made.	2

160	160		204							2	13

175	175		301									This is the afternoon he wakes up after he has lost his memories for the first time.																						
176	176		301									Standing in front of an endless Red Tide, Lithos caresses the glass jar in his arms longingly.																						
177	177		301								Lithos	I just wanted to protect everyone...	2																					
178	178		301								Lithos	I've been thinking about how to allow humans to coexist with the Punishing Virus all these years because I realized there wasn't a way to eradicate the virus completely.	2																					
179	179		204							2	1																							
180	180		301								Lithos	Haha... You look like you're wondering why an Ascendant would want something like that.	2																					
181	181		204							2																								
182	182		301									Lithos holds the jar up, staring woefully at the things inside.																						
183	183		301								Lithos	These are what remain of my "family."	2					1																
184	184		301								Lithos	My father left me at an orphanage because of my disability.	2																					
185	185		301								Lithos	It was a heaven for adults but a hell for children. Every second there was torment, but we kids survived with our "mother" by protecting each other...	2																					
186	186		301								Lithos	I saw selfish people and selfless souls. I was hurt, and I was also aided. My feelings toward humankind are more complicated than simple love or hate, and that's how I feel about the Punishing Virus too.	2																					
187	187		301								Lithos	The outbreak broke down the fortified cage of the orphanage. My siblings and I escaped, led by our "mother," and we finally got our freedom.	2																					
188	188		301								Lithos	...So I was once grateful for this calamity.	2																					
189	189		301								Lithos	...Until it took away everyone I loved one by one.	2																					
190	190		204							2	2

197	197		301							1	Lithos	I just wanted to protect everyone. Anyone that was left behind.	2																					
198	198		301								Lithos	Don't be afraid. The Red Tide isn't something cruel. They might not be living as individual beings, but they're reborn through it.	2																					
199	199		301								Lithos	This may not be the ideal choice, but... it is the best option I can find.	2																					
200	200		301								Lithos	As long as something remains... even in this unliving state... it will be better than death.	2																					
201	201		301								Lithos	...This is the only way for those of us who have survived... to see those who died... to see her again...	2																					
202	202		301									Lithos grabs their long purple hair instinctually as if holding onto the remains of someone they deeply care about.																						
203	203		301								Lithos	I know you wish to stay with real humans instead of the "shards" that form these projections.	2																					
204	204		301								Lithos	But you will be inevitably betrayed if you give your trust to other people. You can only protect yourself and others if you hold absolute power.	2

231	231		301								Assad	They needed to put food on their tables as well. Not to mention that the Cargo Crew's reputation got tarnished after the Blessing Boxes. No one would have listened if we hadn't had something to offer.	2																					
232	232		301								Assad	I might not agree with Rachel on a lot of things, but I think she was right to work with Ashlar and split the profit of the Blessing Boxes with him.	2

289	289		301								Rachel	I did the same. I've privately tasked people to look for Field multiple times over the years. There was news every now and then, but there was nothing we could confirm, so I never told you about any of this.	2																					
290	290		301								Noan	Is that true? You have news about him?!	1																					
291	291		301								Rachel	I told you I couldn't confirm if that was him.	2

293	293		301								Noan	Leave the Cargo Crew?	1																					
294	294		301								Rachel	Yeah. Most people who stay here don't have a choice, but you're different. You're young. You should go see the world.	2

332	332		301									She lowers her head and continues speaking as if she cannot stop.																						
333	333		301								Rachel	"Attitude determines altitude," that's what the old folks used to say. You're patient enough to understand and learn, which means you're much better than many who are already six feet under the ground.	2																					
334	334		301								Rachel	Even though she wanted to send you to the Cargo Crew when you were nine...	2																					
335	335		301								Rachel	She did that only because she was anxious. Julie wasn't the fittest person. With the work she was involved in... she was worried that she would leave you too early and you wouldn't be able to survive on your own.	2																					
336	336		301								Noan	...	1																					
337	337		301								Noan	She wouldn't tell me about any of it, and I only knew that she coughed a lot. If you didn't tell me afterward, I wouldn't have known that she was sick all along.	1

343	343		301								Rachel	Yeah. Before she put on that mask, she was about your height, and her eyes were as stubborn as yours...	2																					
344	344		301								Rachel	Her hair and clothes were as dark as yours. Didn't make a sound when she walked, that woman. Couldn't spot her at night when the lights were off.	2																					
345	345		301								Rachel	...You know, sometimes I really wish you'd stick that firefly on your shoulder. I wouldn't have to worry about losing you in a night shift.	2

357	357		301								Assad	Who's free to dye someone's hair nowadays, anyway? Kid's stuck with his hair unless he becomes a Construct or something.	1																					
358	358		301								Rachel	None of us would have stayed here and worked our lives away if we could just become a Construct.	2

413	413		301								Assad	You know I don't usually wear a coat. Barbra gave me the jacket yesterday.	2																					
414	414		301								Noan	We've been talking about our plans and the weapons we moved to the train all this time! Captain Rachel says no one outside this room can know!	1																					
415	415		301								Assad	Don't worry about it. My wife keeps suspecting I'm seeing someone behind her back, so she's just checking who I've been calling and looking into the ladies I've been meeting. She's not interested in the weapons whatsoever.	2																					
416	416		301								Assad	Relax. Rachel and I have been eating at Barbra's, and she's been helping us with the books! We're all in the same boat, aren't we? Stop being so suspicious!	2

421	421		301								Assad	You haven't eaten, have you? There's still canned food on the table. Finish them and go to bed. We'll sort out this mess after Rachel wakes up.	2																					
422	422		301								Noan	No, that's too risky.	1																					
423	423		301								Assad	Risky? When did you get so distrustful like Rachel? How many supplies has Barbra helped gather for the Cargo Crew? What good will it do her if our little sting here got exposed? Stop sticking your nose into our marriage!	2																					
424	424		301								Assad	Stop staring; I've gotta catch Barbra now before something else goes awry. And if you tell anyone about us and embarrass me, I'll make sure you regret it, you hear me?	2
