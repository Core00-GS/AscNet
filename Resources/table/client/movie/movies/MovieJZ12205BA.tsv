6	6		301								Vera	If you have nothing else to say, I'm going back. I hate wasting time...	1

15	15		301									Vera notices the information about an all-new frame in the files. Nikola nods and casts it to the holographic display.																						
16	16		301								Nikola	It's your new frame, secretly designed for anti-Construct combat, with its power and armor significantly boosted. It hasn't officially entered service in Babylonia records, so... keep it off the books. Have I made myself clear?	1																					
17	17		204							2	13																							
18	18		301								Vera	Designed for anti-Construct combat... A filthy "executioner" that specializes in taking the lives of their peers. It does suit me well, but...	2																					
19	19		204							2																								
20	20		301								Vera	Why is there a need to use an unofficial frame with such urgency? Stop bluffing and tell me, who is this target?	2																					
21	21		301								Nikola	To kill a hero that has gone out of control... Only a filthy executioner like you can do such a job.	1																					
22	22		301									Nikola stares into Vera's eyes for a long time before finally saying the name of the target.

35	31		301									Seeing Vera, Lloyd makes the same smile that he always carries, despite his visibly severe Punishing Virus infection. No one would be surprised if he turned into a Corrupted in the next minute.																						
36	32		301								Lloyd	Is this your new frame...? It looks quite similar to the previous one, but it gives me a completely different feeling.																						
37	33		301								Vera	This new frame is designed for killing Constructs... and I'm here for you.																						
38	34		301									Vera speaks apathetically without her usual grin.																						
39	35		301								Lloyd	Yeah... I know...																						
40	36		301									Lloyd's calm response makes Vera feel annoyed for no reason.																						
41	37		301								Vera	Why? Why are you not running away...?																						
42	38		301									According to Nikola, Lloyd was leading a squad of Construct soldiers in a regular mission, but they were surrounded by Corrupted. Lloyd fled, leaving all other soldiers behind.																						
43	39		301								Vera	What the heck did you run into...?																						
44	40		301								Lloyd	It was just one Corrupted... But it alone had brought despair to all of us.																						
45	41		301								Lloyd	You probably won't believe me, but that Corrupted had its own consciousness, along with superior strength. It called itself "Gabriel", and it even had the ability to command other Corrupted.																						
46	42		301								Lloyd	But it wasn't after those soldiers... Its target had always been me.																						
47	43		301								Vera	A Corrupted with its own consciousness...																						
48	44		301									When Vera was still working for Kurono, she once heard about the special Corrupted—the Ascendants.																						
49	45		301								Lloyd	No matter how hard we fought, we could just barely hold off the attacks from Gabriel and the countless Corrupted.																						
50	46		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Lloyd finally managed to break through the siege alone, but it was all part of its plan.

58	54		301									Gabriel shakes its head and closes the book in its hand.																						
59	55		301								Gabriel	Unlike you humans, I do not lie, especially when I'm facing a weak foe.	1																					
60	56		301									Gabriel raises its hand, and the Corrupted surrounding the soldiers far away immediately stop attacking, only keeping a loose circle around them.																						
61	57		301								Gabriel	And... you don't have a choice either.	1																					
62	58		301									As Gabriel speaks, it reaches out a bony left hand toward Lloyd. Inside its palm, blood-red virus begins to form...																						
63	59		301			RImgBg1Shake						As Lloyd's infection level rapidly goes up, his mind is devoured by an excruciating agony.

76	70		301								Lloyd	But why do I still want to stay alive? No matter how awful I get, I don't want to die...	1																					
77	71		301									Lloyd's right hand keeps trembling from the infection, hardly holding on to his banner spear. He strips his uniform apart and ties it up.																						
78	72		301								Lloyd	How terribly clumsy of me... I'm so weak and timid, but still want to fight to live until the last moment.	1																					
79	73		201							1	500345	8																						
80	74		301							1	Vera	There's nothing shameful about fighting to live... You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm still going to take your life.	1																					
81	75		301									Vera gazes at Lloyd as she unsheathes the katana. The next moment, it clashes with the head of his banner spear—and she finally smiles again.

146	140		301									Lloyd chuckles with slight embarrassment.																						
147	141		301								Lloyd	Compared with fighting, maybe I'm better at writing stories. But I never regret becoming "Lloyd" and carrying the destiny of hero upon my shoulders...	2
