8	8		301								Murray	There's no need to worry.	1

14	14		301								Murray	A lot of people went in with the main force this time. What's weird about knowing a few of them?	1																					
15	15		301								Lee	...	2																					
16	16		301								Murray	Exploring the ruins takes a lot of stamina with all the heavy protective equipment and safety terminals. That's why commandants can't operate around Dead Zones for too long.	1																					
17	17		301								Murray	Lee, make sure the commandant gets some rest. There's bound to be trouble. The commandant needs to be at peak performance to make sure nothing bad happens.	1																					
18	18		301									Murray smiles and says goodbye to the four of you, then terminates the call.

28	28		301									With the warm afternoon sun at your backs, the remains left behind by the Red Tide emit the same peculiar gazes, surrounding you on all sides.																						
29	29		301									The crumbling buildings nearby form a concrete forest reaching into the low clouds, limiting their visibility.																						
30	30		301									In the shadow of the abandoned factories, there is a pile of crates of varying sizes, most of which show signs of being rummaged through.

34	34		301							1	Liv	I wonder if those crates contain any clues.	1																					
35	35		301									As she keeps moving, Liv examines the crates stacked on the side of the road.																						
36	36		301								Lucia	This area has already been picked clean by scavengers. I doubt there's anything of value here.	2																					
37	37		301								Lee	Scavengers rummage for supplies, but clues will be left in their tracks.	3																					
38	38		301								Liv	Hey, what's this?	1																					
39	39		301									Liv runs up to the crates beside her and returns with a book.																						
40	40		301									The book appears to have been hidden in the crates and its pages were specially preserved.																						
41	41		301									Even then, the book has deteriorated over time. It seems like the pages will rip out with little effort.																						
42	42		301								Lee	It's a book—the predecessor to e-books. I've heard that people in the Golden Age would restore e-books into physical copies that were sold for nostalgia or collection. Looks like it's one of those physical books.	3																					
43	43		301									The four of you continue onward, book in hand.																						
44	44		301									While Lucia continues to look around, she glances at the book in Liv's hand, seemingly interested.																						
45	45		301								Lucia	What's in the book? Is it a clue?	2																					
46	46		301									Carefully, Liv opens the faded cover, and a white petal falls out onto her hand.																						
47	47		204							1	1																							
48	48		301								Liv	It's a... pear blossom? It's been flattened. I don't know if it's real or not.	1																					
49	49		301									She carefully puts the petal back and reads the title of the book.																						
50	50		301								Liv	"Cardman Rider Genesis"...?	1																					
51	51		301									Liv quickly skims through it and conveys the story to the rest of you.																						
52	52		301									Based on her description, the story is about the fate of a young man who uses the power of cards to shapeshift and save the Earth from aliens with the help of his companions.																						
53	53		301								Lucia	By the look of the content, there's nothing that can be used as a clue.	2																					
54	54		301								Liv	At least it was an interesting read.	1																					
55	55		301								Liv	I feel that it's great to be able to trust and fight side-by-side with your companions. Not just in the story, but in real life as well...	1																					
56	56		301								Lucia	Same here. I'm really glad to have met you all.	2																					
57	57		301									Liv nods and carefully turns the book to the last page.																						
58	58		301									On the inside of the back cover, she sees a beautifully written note...																						
59	59		301									"Earth has been stricken with innumerable disasters, and time has washed every one of them away. Live for tomorrow, because all will pass.—To Shrek"																						
60	60		301								Liv	Any disaster will eventually subside, so we must keep fighting. We maintain hope as we wait for a better tomorrow...	1																					
61	61		301									Liv silently recites the note as she rubs the white lining of the page with her fingertips.																						
62	62		301									Suddenly, as if she notices something, she holds the book in front of her and carefully confirms her suspicions.																						
63	63		204							1																								
64	64		301								Liv	Hey... Looks like something's been covered up with repair glue...	1																					
65	65		301									She puts the book up to the sunlight, trying to see what is under the glue.																						
66	66		301								Lucia	Anything?	2																					
67	67		301									Lucia leans over to Liv and sees a line written in messy handwriting under the patch.																						
68	68		301									"Don't scribble those lies on a book for me! Who the heck still believes in hope on this forsaken planet?!"																						
69	69		301								Lucia	...	2																					
70	70		204							1	6																							
71	71		301								Liv	Sorry, it doesn't look like a clue.	1																					
72	72		301									Liv makes an apologetic face, then places the petal back into the book.																						
73	73		301								Lucia	It's okay. We just came across it anyway.	2																					
74	74		301								Liv	It might not be a clue, but seems like it was cherished by its owner. Mind if I put it back?	1																					
75	75		302								Go ahead. It's not that far back.	76

80	80		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Liv	I'm back.	1																					
81	81		301								Lucia	Alright, let's go. Hopefully, we can find some leads along the way.	2																					
82	82		301								Lucia	After all, we're likely to encounter Ascendants up ahead. It'd be nice to have some more intel.	2																					
83	83		204							1	14																							
84	84		301								Liv	You're right. Commandant, when you were up against the Ascendants...	1																					
85	85		301									The other three look over anxiously, as if not wanting to recall their so-called "vacation"...																						
86	86		302								Relax, I still plan on cashing in on retirement...	87																						
87	87		204							3	10																							
88	88		301								Lee	Save that sort of talk for when we return safely to Babylonia.	3

91	91		204							1	6																							
92	92		301								Liv	Um... I'm not sure if this counts as a clue. But...	1																					
93	93		301									Liv looks around at the surrounding area, lost in contemplation.																						
94	94		302								What is it?	95																						
95	95		301								Liv	I've been here before...	1																					
96	96		301								Lee	Really? You've been here before, too?	3																					
97	97		301								Liv	You too, Lee?	1																					
98	98		301								Lee	I recall passing through here on a survey mission, but that was when I was still with Kurono.	3																					
99	99		301								Liv	Oh... It's been a while for me too...	1																					
100	100		302								Is it something from your past, Liv?	101	What happened?	101																				
101	101		204							1																								
102	102		301								Liv	(Nods) It was before I was a Construct. Back when I was a medic, I was ordered to come rescue people here.	1																					
103	103		301									Liv points to the southeast.																						
104	104		301								Liv	Over there. But I'm sure it's already completely destroyed.	1																					
105	105		301								Liv	At the time, our retaliation forces were overwhelmed by Corrupted. Most of the soldiers were ordered to evacuate.	1																					
106	106		301								Liv	But that would've led to even more casualties... I stayed behind to heal the wounded until the Constructs arrived...	1																					
107	107		301								Liv	But I...	1																					
108	108		302								Seems like this place has left quite an impression.	109																						
109	109		301								Liv	Has it?	1																					
110	110		204							1	1																							
111	111		301								Liv	It really has... It was because of that incident that I became a Construct. That has allowed me to help more people, like what I'm doing now.	1																					
112	112		301								Liv	And because I helped everyone, I was able to join the Gray Ravens and be with you all.	1																					
113	113		301								Liv	But I'm surprised Lee came here on a mission as well... What about you, Lucia? Have you been here before?	1																					
114	114		301								Liv	If that's the case, then I think fate has brought us together.	1																					
115	115		301									When asked this question, Lucia lets out an awkward expression.																						
116	116		301								Lucia	This place seems familiar, but I can't recall why...	2																					
117	117		301								Lee	Maybe you lost some of your memories when you changed frames?	3																					
118	118		301								Lucia	Back then...?	2																					
119	119		301								Liv	No, I already checked. Lucia's M.I.N.D. didn't suffer any memory loss, and her memory data was stable.	1																					
120	120		301								Liv	Lucia didn't lose any of her memories when she was transferred into the Plume frame.	1																					
121	121		301								Lee	Maybe it's just deja vu?	3																					
122	122		301								Lucia	Deja Vu?	2																					
123	123		301								Lee	You probably have been somewhere similar. That's why you think it looks familiar.	3																					
124	124		301								Lucia	But I don't have any memories from a place like this.	2																					
125	125		204							1																								
126	126		301								Liv	Maybe you lost some memories before you transferred into the Plume frame?	1																					
127	127		302								...	128	(Think now's the time to tell her?)	128																				
128	128		301									Thinking over this issue, Lucia opens her mouth hesitantly.																						
129	129		301								Lucia	Well... Now that I think about it, some of my memory is a bit hazy and abnormal.	2																					
130	130		301								Lucia	That was with the former Gray Ravens before I met you all...	2																					
131	131		301									She sighs softly, unsure of how to continue.																						
132	132		204							1	1																							
133	133		302								Lucia...	134	Actually...	134																				
134	134		301									...You tell Lucia about what Hassen and Asimov said before you all left.																						
135	135		301								Lucia	You mean... they have hidden a memory from me?	2																					
136	136		302								I can authorize you to access the memory.	137																						
137	137		301									Lucia lowers her head in contemplation for a moment.																						
138	138		301								Lucia	I trust your decision, Commandant, but we should prioritize the mission. Time is of the essence.	2																					
139	140		204							2	1																							
140	141		301								Lucia	Also... I still have some things I need to confirm.	2																					
141	142		301								Liv	It's fine, Lucia. Don't worry about whether or not you've been here with others before knowing the commandant.	1																					
142	143		301								Liv	From now on, the four of us will be on missions together.	1																					
143	144		301								Lucia	Alright, thanks. I'm not worried about this... But you're right.	2																					
144	145		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	No matter what happens in the future, the Gray Ravens will always be together.	2
