18	18		301							1	Bianca	I'll keep them away with my arrows.	1																					
19	19		301								Purifying Force Member	Your ID... You're the one from Gray Raven, aren't you? And the Construct with you... is that Bianca?	2

21	21		301							1	Purifying Force Member	What are you doing here?	2																					
22	22		301								Bianca	I should be the one asking you. Why are you attacking the Support Force?	1																					
23	23		301								Purifying Force Member	Because they looked terrified the moment they saw us and started running away.	2																					
24	24		201							1	500019		-400

27	26		301								Purifying Force Member	To what?!	2																					
28	28		301							1	Bianca	Enough! Isn't this the reason why the other Constructs are so terrified of the Purifying Force?	1																					
29	29		301								Purifying Force Member	So what? We're now suspecting deserters in the Support Force, so get out of my face.	2																					
30	30		302								Ignore them, Bianca.	31	Is everyone from the Purifying Force as impulsive as you?	31																				
31	31		301								Purifying Force Member	This isn't your jurisdiction, Gray Raven Commandant.	2																					
32	32		301								Bianca	But it is. These people from the Support Force are on a joint operation with Gray Raven, so they're very much affiliated with the Gray Raven Commandant.	1																					
33	33		301								Purifying Force Member	You're not letting Gray Raven challenge the Purifying Force, are you, Bianca?	2																					
34	34		301								Bianca	Of course not, seeing that I'm also part of the Purifying Force. We can give it a shot right nowâ€”Purifying Force versus Purifying Force.	1																					
35	35		301								Purifying Force Member	...	2																					
36	36		301								Purifying Force Member	...Tch. Goddamn fence sitter.	2																					
37	37		301								Purifying Force Member	That's why you're on a regular Task Force instead of fully here with us, isn't it? Fence sitter.	2																					
38	38		302								Take it back.	39	Do you feel proud attacking one of your own?	39
