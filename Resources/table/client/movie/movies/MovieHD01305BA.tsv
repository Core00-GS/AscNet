10	9		302								Sure.	10																						
11	10		301									As soon as you leave, you see a small figure curled up in the chair behind youâ€”the girl who was listening to Liv's story earlier.																						
12	11		301									She fell asleep on the chair. Her face has a red mark from the arm of the chair, but she's still sound asleep.																						
13	12		302								Where's her family?	13																						
14	13		204							1	3																							
15	14		301								Liv	Um... She told me she was all by herself when we first met. No friends or family.	1																					
16	15		302								Wake her up.	16	How about we wake her up, Liv?	24																				
17	16		302								It's too cold to sleep here.	17																						
18	17		204							1	1																							
19	18		301									You gently tap the arm of the chair she's resting her head on. Awoken by the strange sound, she yawns softly and stretches like a tired kitten.																						
20	19		301									She opens her eyes and, a few moments later, looks at the strangers standing before her.

26	25		301									Liv kneels down and gently strokes the girl's hair.																						
27	26		301								Liv	Time to wake up. You'll catch a cold if you keep sleeping on the chair.	1																					
28	27		301									Resting her head on the arm of the chair, the tired "kitten" hears the strange sound, yawns softly, and stretches.

32	31		301								Girl	Huh... Who's that? Oh, the dancing robot...	2																					
33	32		302								Yeah.	33																						
34	33		302								Why are you here all by yourself?	34																						
35	34		301								Girl	I'm waiting for my mommy and daddy.	2																					
36	35		204							1	3																							
37	36		301								Girl	But I've waited so long... And they're still not back. They don't want me anymore. Do they?	2																					
38	37		301									Hearing this, Liv looks at you gloomily, as if to confirm whether they all thought the same thing.																						
39	38		302								(Nod to Liv)	39																						
40	39		204							1																								
41	40		301									Whether or not they know the answer to this question, most of the children left in the conservation area had lost their parents...																						
42	41		301									Unfortunately, this child doesn't seem to be the exception.																						
43	42		301									But who can bring themselves to shatter her hope?																						
44	43		302								What's your name?	44																						
45	44		301								Ellie	My name's Ellie.	2

48	47		301								Ellie	...	2																					
49	48		301									The girl hesitates a moment and looks at the crowd off in the distance.																						
50	49		301								Ellie	I haven't made any friends here yet. Mommy and Daddy aren't back either...	2																					
51	50		302								Want to come and play with us?	51																						
52	51		301								Ellie	Is that okay?	2																					
53	52		301									Her dark eyes suddenly burst into light. Seems like she had been waiting for someone to invite her for quite some time.																						
54	53		301								Liv	Of course! We're going to try out some of the activities here.	1																					
55	54		301								Ellie	The ones for collecting Star Tickets?	2																					
56	55		302								Got that right.	56																						
57	56		301								Ellie	Oh, I know those. You just need to join the events, and you can ask the old lady for Star Tickets.	2																					
58	57		302								Let's go together!	58																						
59	58		301								Ellie	Okay!	2																					
60	59		301								Liv	Which one do you wanna do first?	1																					
61	60		302								Hmm...	61																						
62	61		301								Ellie	Can we try that out?	2																					
63	62		301									She points to an area beside the convention hall.																						
64	63		302								"Four-legged Race"?	64																						
65	64		301								Liv	The one where three people tie their legs together and race?	1																					
66	65		302								Won't that be hard for Ellie to do with us?	66																						
67	66		301								Liv	She's not as tall as us, but we can run at her speed.	1

73	72		301									You adjust the bandage tying you and Ellie's legs together. Even though the bandage is wrapped around your foot, it comes up to Ellie's calf.																						
74	73		301									As long as you and Liv hold her up in the air and let her feet move with your legs, you can avoid tripping over each other due to such a large difference in your strides.																						
75	74		302								Ready, Liv?	75

77	76		301							1	Liv	(Nods)	1

115	112		301								Ellie	I love chocolate! Especially winning it with you two. But...	2																					
116	113		301									She fixes her gaze on her straw bracelet, which was a commemoration award for anyone who failed to place in a game.																						
117	114		302								Do you like that more?	115																						
118	115		301								Ellie	Yeah... Mommy made one for me. But it was ruined after all the rain...	2
