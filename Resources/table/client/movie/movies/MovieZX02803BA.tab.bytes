11	11		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						It has been a week since Karenina and Teddy accepted the job and arrived at the lunar base. After completing the Omega Prototype, Karenina began work on a new project.

13	13		301							1	Teddy	M.I.N.D. compatibility test complete. Frame stability rate... Hey, try to move your right hand.	1																					
14	14		301								Karenina	Like this...?																						
15	15		301								Teddy	Yep. All good. The readings on the base stats of this frame have all exceeded a regular frame's... Just what kind of tech did that guy use in the base model he provided...	1																					
16	16		301								Karenina	Hey, missy, can I get out now?																						
17	17		301								Teddy	One second... I need to read and record a disclaimer.	1																					
18	18		301								Karenina	A what now?																						
19	19		301								Teddy	A disclaimer that says I was forced to help you calibrate your frame, and I am in no way responsible if your frame explodes. The Cosmos Technician Union cannot hold me accountable if you are killed in the line of duty.	1

22	22		301			RImgBg1Shake					Karenina	**** you! ************! Go to hell!																						
23	23		301									Brashly, Karenina pulls off the cables on her body and jumps up, stretching her limbs and moving her joints.																						
24	24		201							1	500494	1																						
25	25		301							1	Karenina	Hmph, the frame is indeed performing nicely... Mobility, explosiveness, balance... all better than what I requested!	1

28	28		301							1	Teddy	They modified the frame based on your requests, didn't they? Why are you surprised...	2																					
29	29		301								Karenina	I designed the changes, but the creep provided the base model of the frame. That is why we can complete it so quickly.	1																					
30	30		301								Teddy	Are we sure... about that creep and the people in the lunar base?	2																					
31	31		301									Although she has followed Karenina to the Moon, Teddy clearly distrusts Collins.																						
32	32		204							1	13																							
33	33		301								Karenina	Not really, but that doesn't affect our work. As long as we can help the people on the surface, we'll do what it takes.	1

36	36		301									Karenina swings her transformable Blast Hammer, her weapon of choice, while Teddy watches from the side.

38	38		301								Karenina	So? It's cool, isn't it?	1																					
39	39		301								Teddy	Yeah. It suits you.	2																					
40	40		301									Karenina was not expecting to hear Teddy complimenting her. She feels a little self-conscious.																						
41	41		301								Karenina	Hmph... I designed it, after all. Not only does it pack a punch, but it can also adapt to different battles...	1																					
42	42		204							2	13																							
43	43		301								Teddy	...A weapon that doesn't require careful maneuvers really fits a dumb*** who only knows how to hold the trigger down.	2

45	45		301								Karenina	Hey, are you interested in helping me test my weapon? I need a target, you little ****!	1

50	50		301									Right as the two are about to strangle each other, a middle-aged man in researcher garb enters the preparation room. He looks very awkward, crouching as he comes in.																						
51	51		201							1	500499	2																						
52	52		301							1	???	Ah, haha... Haha, eh, we actually have prepared something for you to test the new frame. You don't have to get your own target.	1																					
53	53		301									The miserable-looking man is Yarha. He is said to be the research director of this lunar base, but his obsequious attitude appears otherwise.

56	56		301							1	Karenina	Director Yarha, we were just kidding...	2																					
57	57		301								Yarha	Ah, haha... I was kidding too...	1																					
58	58		301									Right before the discomfort boils over, Teddy sighs and stands up from behind the calibration terminal.

61	61		301							1	Teddy	Is the testing for the new frame about to begin? Can you take us there, Director Yarha?	2																					
62	62		301								Yarha	Ah, correct. This way, please. But I really was kidding...	1																					
63	63		301								Teddy	Yeah, yeah, we know.	2																					
64	64		202							1	2																							
65	65		301									The two of them follow Yarha, leaving the preparation room and heading toward the testing area. Meanwhile, two men quietly start talking on the other side of the room.

68	68		301							1	Liszt	Is that frame the "second request" from the girl? But why would you provide her with the frame we developed as the base model? We spent so much effort to reverse-engineer it from "her"...	1																					
69	69		301								Collins	Liszt, you're being silly now. "Don't be stingy with your baits if you want to catch a big fish." The fishermen in the Arctic told me that back when I was posted there. The more expensive the bait, the bigger the fish.	2																					
70	70		301									Patting Liszt on the back, Collins starts walking toward the testing area, but he stops with some parting words before going further.																						
71	71		301								Collins	Don't disregard ancient wisdom, you know?	2
