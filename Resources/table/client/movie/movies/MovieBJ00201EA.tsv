7	7		301									A tiny, dirty finger reaches out, scratching a scar onto the burnt wall.																						
8	8		301									In truth, she no longer remembers what day it is. Hunger and terror work wonders in shattering a child's thoughts and memories.																						
9	9		301									"Once the CPF is activated, we'll be back." Someone said this to her, but who was it? Her father? Her uncle?																						
10	10		301									She despises herself for not being able to keep the time... And the Corrupted that would sometimes stumble upon her always gave her quite the scare.																						
11	11		301									She only knows that today is the "third day", but she has no way of knowing how many "third days"have passed before it, lost in memory.																						
12	12		301									She despises herself so much that she could just die. Dying sounds good right now.																						
13	13		301									All the gilded stories her Grandpa told her of mankind's Golden Age aren't enough to cover up the rust of the scavenger's life she leads during the end of days.																						
14	14		301									Can mankind ever claw its way back to the Golden Age? Or at least a time when the CPFs still worked like they should?																						
15	15		301									Those inimitable, intricate machines... We only remember the extent of their contribution when they stop working.																						
16	16		301									Maybe I should just die. No one can fix the CPFs anyway.																						
17	17		301									Maybe I should just die. No one will give me hope anyway.																						
18	18		301									Maybe I should just die. No one will come and save me anyway.																						
19	19		301									If I charge out this barricade, I can die.

40	40		301								Liv	...But those aren't the main issue.	3																					
41	41		301									Liv rolls up the hem of the girl's pants. The wound on her leg oozes black blood, a typical symptom of the first stages of Punishing Virus infection.
