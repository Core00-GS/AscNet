3	3		301			DialogEnable						It all still feels so surreal...																						
4	4		301									Is it because of the intense series of events? Now that everything is finally over, you instead feel like being in a dream.																						
5	5		301									A few days after that, Babylonia sent the Support Force and Engineering Force to Venus Splash Park's vicinity...																						
6	6		301									And in the end, they found no Ascendants traces in a 300-kilometer radius.																						
7	7		301									"They must have gotten what they came for," said President Hassen.																						
8	8		301									But what did the death of Shome, and all the events surrounding the Venus Splash Park accomplish? Perhaps, only time will tell.																						
9	9		301									President Hassen, like his usual self, laughs it off, saying that he can do the worrying. And as for you all, those who went through this horror-show: Get some rest and wait for orders.																						
10	10		301									Well...																						
11	11		301									Lucia and Lee are carrying I-beams around, things a human obviously cannot help with. They must be helping out in the Engineering Force.																						
12	12		301									Ayla is arguing with Karenina over something...																						
13	999010		301									Camu, who lost track of Roland's whereabouts, has just been silent. He did not leave, but perhaps a word or two asking if he wants to be here would be nice?																						
14	13		301									As for the rest, they probably went to play.																						
15	14		302								Guess I'll go entertain myself.	15																						
16	15		301									Well, not like they need help.

22	21		302								What are you doing here?	22																						
23	22		301							1	Vera	Why can't I be here? It's not like you own this place.	1																					
24	23		302								...?	24																						
25	24		301							1	Vera	What are you getting at?	1																					
26	25		302								...Thanks.	26

28	999001		204							1	1																							
29	27		301							1	Vera	...Spare the thanks. I just happened to have an adrenaline shot left.	1																					
30	28		301							1	Vera	...And, people I save—they rarely live long.	1																					
31	29		302								Even so.	31																						
32	30		302								Still, thank you.	32																						
33	31		301									Hearing this, Vera raises her eyebrows as if offended.

35	32		301							1	Vera	...	1																					
36	33		301							1	Vera	...Guess you really aren't afraid of death.	1																					
37	34		301							1	Vera	You almost became commandant-mince from that Gabriel, and now you're involving yourself with Death again?	1																					
38	35		302								Well, I'm not...	36																						
39	36		301							1	Vera	So, what are you here for?	1																					
40	37		301							1	Vera	Just to say thanks?	1

43	40		301							2	Lee	Yep. Commandant's coming by just to express gratitude.	2																					
44	41		301							2	Lee	So just return a "you're welcome," Vera.	2																					
45	42		301									Carrying a bowl of icy-looking snacks, Lee inserts himself between you and Vera.																						
46	43		301							2	Lee	Here, the engies made this after they fixed up the vending machine over there.	2																					
47	44		301							2	Lee	This thing's called "Venus Splash Park Special: Classic Summer Shaved Ice," or something.	2

49	999009		301							1	Vera	You what? And what's with that get-up?	1																					
50	45		301								Vera	You came all the way here, to give me this? Ridiculous.	1																					
51	46		301							1	Vera	Looks like that beastly Lee from before is now all domesticated.	1																					
52	47		301							2	Lee	No, I'm just being extra cautious around you.	2																					
53	48		301							1	Vera	Hah, should I try applying and transferring your precious commandant over to Cerberus?	1																					
54	49		301							2	Lee	That's not going to happen.	2																					
55	50		301							1	Vera	Hm-hm, we'll see.	1																					
56	51		301									Vera continues on, ignoring your puzzled expression.																						
57	999004		204							1	4																							
58	52		301							1	Vera	So, Kurono kiddo, what "exactly" are you here for?	1																					
59	53		301							1	Vera	If it's just to protect your Commandant, you can have 'em back now.	1																					
60	54		301							2	Lee	...	2																					
61	55		301									Lee stays silent for a while, then he shoves the shaved ice into Vera's hands.																						
62	56		301							2	Lee	Like Commandant, I've come here to express my thanks.	2																					
63	57		301							2	Lee	Regardless of what you're actually doing here, you did save Commandant's life.	2																					
64	58		301							1	Vera	...	1																					
65	59		301									Not having expected such a situation, Vera pauses for a tiny flicker of time.																						
66	999005		204							1	13																							
67	60		301							1	Vera	What's the point of Constructs eating something that's just taste, and no substance?	1																					
68	999006		204							1	1																							
69	61		301							1	Vera	Since this is human food, shouldn't you be giving it to 【kuroname】?	1																					
70	62		301							2	Lee	If I gave our dear injured personnel this, Liv will burn me at the stake.	2																					
71	63		301							2	Lee	You can try, if you wanna die. I still want to live a lil' longer.	2																					
72	64		301									A slight frown shows up on Vera's face, but almost instantly, her usual smirk returns.																						
73	65		301							1	Vera	Fine. You say thanks, and I accept.	1																					
74	66		301							2	Lee	...	2																					
75	67		301							2	Lee	...Thank you.	2

77	68		301							1	Vera	You've really changed, Lee.	1																					
78	69		301							1	Vera	...Alright, alright. Hurry on and get lost now. You're disturbing my peace and quiet.	1																					
79	70		301							2	Lee	You need lessons in lying. You've never been the peace-and-quiet type.	2																					
80	999008		204							1	4																							
81	71		301							1	Vera	Guess I've changed, too.	1																					
82	72		301									You turn to leave, but Vera speaks, once more.																						
83	73		202							1	2																							
84	74		301								Vera	The others in Cerberus will be off on another mission, and I'll be a free agent for a while—Nikola's orders.																						
85	75		301								Vera	Before Cerberus finally gets a commandant, the higher-ups will likely be having headaches about where to settle us jinxes.																						
86	76		301								Vera	Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, I wonder which squad I should go plague next.
