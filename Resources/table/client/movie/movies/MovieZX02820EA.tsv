25	25		301							1		Karenina deploys the gravity cannon form of the Blast Hammer and shoots at the ground under the monster. The compressed gravitons generate an enormous gravity that neutralizes its floating force, pulling it back to the Moon's surface.

33	33		301									The monster also extracts all its strength to the zero-point engine, trying to unleash the most powerful gravitational waves to tear the girl apart.

36	36		301									The Blast Hammer's blast engine is lit up by its tail flames. All light shines at this moment, converging into an invincible strike.

54	54		301									Karenina reopens her eyes and finds the damaged zero-point engine has sunk under the Moon's surface. The gravitational waves are directly acting on the rocks, creating ripples on the nearby ground.																						
55	55		301									Rocks protrude from the ground like swords while soft lunar soil flows down like sand.

62	62		301								Karenina	I... guess... so!	1																					
63	63		301									Karenina replies while sprinting between more protruding rocks.																						
64	64		301								Teddy	Then hurry up to the coordinates I sent you. The gravitational waves built up in the zero-point engine will break out in 3 minutes.																						
65	65		301								Karenina	What? Isn't that also within the range of gravitational waves? Are you just picking a better place to die?	1																					
66	66		301								Teddy	Alright... We'll give you a proper funeral. Relax... No, rest in peace.
