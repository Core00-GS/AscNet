13	13		301									Half-lying on the floor, Yarha draws his pistol and keeps shooting the Corrupted before him, finally taking it down before it can reach him.																						
14	14		201							1	500499	19																						
15	15		301							1	Yarha	Ha... W-what the hell... I'm not exactly a bad shot.	1																					
16	16		401				PanelActor1Shake			2	9317013																							
17	18		301									Before he can feel too good about himself, a gush of wind erupts above him. A giant metal hammer sweeps five centimeters above his head, hitting the Corrupted that sneaked up behind him, sending it flying.

21	22		204							1	2																							
22	23		301								Yarha	I'm fine... I used to be a soldier, after all...	1																					
23	24		301									What he did not say was that Karenina swinging her hammer is way more dangerous than any Corrupted.																						
24	25		204							2	13																							
25	26		301								Karenina	There are no serums in this place. It's going to be very bad if you get infected...	2

29	31		301									Before she can finish, the Inver-Devices on her head suddenly stand, alerting her of an incoming Corrupted. The claws of the Corrupted are no match for Karenina's hammer, and it is quickly hurled away by her swing.

32	34		301									The highly-sensitive Inver-Devices were created to detect the slightest hint of the Punishing Virus that could appear when they activated the zero-point engine. Now, they come in extremely handy.																						
33	35		301									Still, what Karenina has done is only a drop in the bucket. More Corrupted are gathering here, and Karenina can only watch, unable to attack in full force with all the delicate machines in the room.																						
34	36		204							2	5																							
35	37		301								Karenina	Hey! T-E-D-D-Y! Can you hear me?	2																					
36	38		201							1	500495	5	2000																					
37	39		301									Karenina's comms terminal has been scrambled all this time for some reason. Such a serious interference has never happened before.

42	45		301								Teddy	I hear you, I hear you... I had my headphones on! You almost ruptured my eardrums... Hold on. Why are there gunshots in the lab?	1																					
43	46		204							1	4																							
44	47		301								Karenina	Listen... There are a lot of Corrupted here! I don't know how... but their number is increasing! Many models used to develop the new specialized frame have been infected, and they've turned into Corrupted...	2																					
45	48		301								Teddy	Are you sure you're not dreaming...? This is the Moon! Where is the Punishing Virus coming from?	1																					
46	49		301								Karenina	How the hell would I know?! Stop interrupting me... and get here ASAP! I need people to move the wounded and stop the Corrupted from spreading!	2																					
47	50		301									Karenina kicks a fallen Kurono soldier away from a Corrupted attack before hammering the Corrupted into the laboratory's wall with a backhand.																						
48	51		301								Teddy	People are hurt? Are people infected...?	1																					
49	52		204							2	4																							
50	53		301								Karenina	Ugh... No! Not yet! Just the Kurono people getting knocked out for now!	2																					
51	54		301									Karenina refrains from telling Teddy that the Kurono soldiers were knocked out by her. Otherwise, there will be a lot of questions and paperwork.																						
52	55		301								Teddy	Wait—what about you?	1																					
53	56		301								Karenina	I'm going to investigate where the virus is coming from. Such a large-scale infection can't happen out of nowhere...	2																					
54	57		301									The disaster that destroyed the world is on everyone's mind.																						
55	58		204							1	14																							
56	59		301								Teddy	Could it be the zero-point reactor...? But our inspection confirmed that there wasn't any Punishing Virus in the vacuum chamber when we started the reactor...	1																					
57	60		301									Then there are only two possibilities—either the source of the disaster had nothing to do with zero-point reactors, or someone from Kurono tampered with their inspection.																						
58	61		301									Although Yarha does not seem to be in the know... but what about the others?																						
59	62		204							1	4																							
60	63		301								Karenina	That's why I'm going to investigate it... What exactly caused the Punishing Virus infection?	2																					
61	64		301									Karenina's Inver-Devices stand upright above her head, detecting the Punishing Virus in the air—as expected, a high concentration is detected further inside the reactor.																						
62	65		204							1	5																							
63	66		301								Teddy	Hey, are you going in alone?! At least wait for us—	1

69	72		301									The static-filled communication suddenly terminates. Karenina sighs before throwing her comms to Yarha, who has just stood back up.																						
70	73		301								Karenina	You heard it... Teddy and the others are coming to cover your retreat.	2																					
71	74		203							2	0.25	-400																						
72	75		201							1	500499	7	400																					
73	76		301							1	Yarha	You're going to investigate the reactor, aren't you, Karenina? Then... you should take this.	1																					
74	77		301									Taking the comms from Karenina, Yarha gives her a card as if giving her a return gift. The icon of Norman Mining Corp is printed on the card.																						
75	78		204							1																								
76	79		301								Yarha	I might be the research director in name only... but it still comes with the corresponding clearance. You should be able to make use of it!	1																					
77	80		301								Karenina	Are you sure...?	2																					
78	81		301									If this is all part of Kurono's scheme, then helping Karenina will certainly make Yarha a traitor to Kurono, seeing that he is one of them.																						
79	82		301								Yarha	This is an emergency. We do what we must... no matter the cost. You're the only one who can stop this now, Karenina.	1																					
80	83		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Karenina nods, and she ventures deeper into the reactor.
