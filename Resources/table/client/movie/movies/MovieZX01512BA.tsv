9	7		301									Qu turns to see several members of the Pulao Crew falling from the city gate. One of them lands among the Corrupted and is torn to pieces in an instant.

31	29		301									Qu reaches the top of the city gate, only to be greeted by the grim looks on the soldiers' faces. They are all training their rifles vigilantly on a single Corrupted, but no one is firing.

37	35		301									It is a most familiar face, that of the Chaofeng Crew Officer—Moyuan. Now Corrupted, her body is a mural of human blood and Corrupted oil. She appears to be murmuring nonsensically.																						
38	36		301									After a moment of silence, Qu gives instructions to the soldiers around her.
