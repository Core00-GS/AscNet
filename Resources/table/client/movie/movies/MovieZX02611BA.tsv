15	15		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						There are seven to eight humans in there—all looking sick and bedridden, each attended to by a few medic bots.																						
16	16		301								Haicma	What are these...																						
17	17		301								Spuner	Straitjackets.																						
18	18		301									The humans in front are all constrained to the bed. Some are no longer conscious. Only the heart rate line on the screen of the vital signs monitor next to the bed is slowly moving up and down.																						
19	19		301								Medic Bot	Sage, don't be sad. Humans, survive.																						
20	20		301									The medic bot next to Nanami keeps waving its arm as if it is hoping for a praise from her.

32	32		301								Nanami	Cut that out already! This is driving Nanami crazy...! How in the world is this protection?!																						
33	33		301								Spuner	There is no use trying to talk sense into them. These medic bots are programmed to "help and look after humans." The condition these humans are in is proof enough that the bots are logically correct.																						
34	34		301									The girl rides on her giant mech. Fury has driven her to move out like an unleashed snow leopard.																						
35	35		301								Nanami	If I am the one responsible for all of this...																						
36	36		301									Before she knows it, a bunch of medic bots appear out of nowhere and stand in her way to keep her from tearing the door down.
