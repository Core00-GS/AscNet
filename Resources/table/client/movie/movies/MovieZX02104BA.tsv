5	5		301			DialogEnable				1	Hassen	I know what you're thinking, 【kuroname】.	1																					
6	6		301								Hassen	We both know that the Punishing Virus first appeared within the chamber of the first zero-point reactor before spreading and infecting the whole world.	1																					
7	7		301								Hassen	That's right. The "first" zero-point reactor.	1																					
8	8		301								Hassen	It's not wise to put all one's eggs in one basket. Given their political wisdom, the people in power during the Golden Age didn't gamble all they had in one reactor either.	1																					
9	9		301								Hassen	They had built other reactor-cities. You are standing on one of them now.	1																					
10	10		301								Hassen	Zero-point reactors were the most-hidden secrets back then, and they still are. Information about their interiors and their whereabouts are still highly classified.	1																					
11	11		301								Hassen	Which is why we lost all information on them when the Punishing Virus broke out and created a fault line in civilizations.	1																					
12	12		301								Hassen	But we finally obtained the location of one of them through... special means recently, which is where you are now.	1																					
13	13		301									Hassen pauses when he says the word "means."																						
14	14		301								Hassen	This seaborne reactor is codenamed "Atlantis".	1																					
15	15		301								Hassen	Consider it part of Plato's utopia. It once contained humanity's hope for a utopia, after all.	1																					
16	16		301								Hassen	After the virus broke out, we lost most of the cutting-edge technologies developed back then. We have no idea what caused the Punishing Virus to spread, or if its existence was related to the zero-point reactor at all.	1																					
17	17		301								Hassen	Because of how classified this information was, the World Government has even lost all research data on zero-point energy.	1																					
18	18		301								Hassen	Without tracing how it started and understanding how it works, we will never find a way to actually counter the Punishing Virus. But the first zero-point reactor was burnt down when it unleashed hell on Earth.	1																					
19	19		301								Hassen	But not all the reactors had an outbreak at the same time. Due to the differences between their research progress, directions, or something else we don't know yet, Atlantis is still intact.	1																					
20	20		301								Hassen	We need you to investigate its reactor with the Cerberus captain. It might not have progressed the same way as the first one, but we are in need of more intel desperately... So, find out as much as you can.	1																					
21	21		301								Hassen	This is a special operation that only you at this moment in time can do.	1																					
22	22		301								Hassen	You and the captain are in a very peculiar situation right now. If Kurono's search for Luna was a legitimate operation, then the Cerberus captain's actions and rescue are no different from treason.	1																					
23	23		301								Hassen	But Kurono's move was no standard operation, and trying to take you away from Babylonia has caused an uproar. Given how messed up and tangled everything is right now, there is no such thing as legitimate anymore.	1																					
24	24		301								Hassen	So I've decided that this is the junction point where we bring you back on the right track.	1																					
25	25		301								Hassen	Although Babylonia is but a shadow of the human world in the past, the complexity of the human heart has not diminished a bit, on the surface or in the air.	1																					
26	26		301								Hassen	There are too many people with secret agendas and their eyes and ears up here. Sending a team to Atlantis directly from Babylonia would have alerted people we don't want to alert.	1																					
27	27		301								Hassen	That's why I decided to take advantage of the fact that you are already on the surface to have you in charge of this classified operation.	1																					
28	28		301								Hassen	The brighter the light, the bigger the shadow it casts, but it also means that truths are better concealed inside. If everyone has decided to place their bets on you, then let's go all-in.	1																					
29	29		301								Hassen	For now, you are a fugitive and a mission operator.	1																					
30	30		301								Hassen	Your detour won't be in vain, of course.	1																					
31	31		301								Hassen	I have a hunch that whatever you discover here will impact Babylonia's course of actions—the future of humankind, in other words.	1																					
32	32		301								Hassen	That "renown" will be more than enough for us to put you in a spotlight before the public.	1																					
33	33		301								Hassen	In turn, you will no longer become a chess piece between Babylonia and Kurono, a senseless sacrifice in our endless struggle. You will be safeguarded by the people's gazes, and you will become their beacon of hope.	1																					
34	34		301								Hassen	I'll wait for your good news on Babylonia.	1

36	36		301							1		Hassen disappears from the projection, and Nikola returns.																						
37	37		301								Nikola	He's explained everything, so I'm not going to repeat it.	1																					
38	38		301								Nikola	Long story short: I decided to loan you to Kurono, but I also had an insurance policy.	1																					
39	39		301								Nikola	It's the Cerberus captain standing next to you.	1																					
40	40		301									He turns to Vera and continues.																						
41	41		301								Nikola	I know that Garnet isn't your favorite frame, but this is an emergency.	1																					
42	42		204							1	13																							
43	43		301								Nikola	Use it to protect the Gray Raven Commandant. Complete the mission and bring me a win.	1																					
44	44		204							1																								
45	45		301								Nikola	I'll guarantee your team's safety. That is my promise.	1

51	51		301									Vera sneers after hearing everything.																						
52	52		201							1	500345	2																						
53	53		301							1	Vera	It seems that not only do I need to bring you back in one piece, but I'll also have to take you to find something about this zero-point reactor.	1																					
54	54		302								It seems that way.	55																						
55	55		204							1	4																							
56	56		301								Vera	Nikola is one demanding bastard.	1																					
57	57		301									Vera does not even bother to call her superior by his title at this point.																						
58	58		302								What are you going to do?	59																						
59	59		204							1	4																							
60	60		301								Vera	What can I do except for following orders?	1																					
61	61		301								Vera	Maybe you don't understand their subtext, so here's a translation—	1																					
62	62		301								Vera	We are on the run. Kurono needs you, so they won't hurt you, which means what's happening right now is "traitorous Cerberus captain kidnapping the Gray Raven Commandant."	1																					
63	63		301								Vera	The only way to justify this as a "classified spec op" from the Chief Commander is if we accomplish the mission and I bring you back.	1																					
64	64		301								Vera	If we're intercepted or captured in the process, I'll take the blame for everything.	1																					
65	65		301								Vera	That explains the Garnet frame... The hostile they're anticipating is...	1																					
66	66		204							1	8																							
67	67		301									Vera closes her eyes, seemingly remembering some unpleasant memories.																						
68	68		301									She sneers.

70	70		301								Vera	No time to waste. We need to get going.	1

73	73		301			RImgBg1Shake						You feel an intense quake beneath your feet.																						
74	74		301									It is no simple tremble. It feels like an earth-shattering quake, and for a second, you feel like the whole world is spinning and shaking.																						
75	75		301									As if an endless herd of wild beasts is sprinting on the surface, or a giant is waking up from its slumber to stretch.																						
76	76		301									The calm surface of the ocean is now replaced by violent waves.																						
77	77		301									No—more precisely, the city underneath your feet is now sinking into the sea, and it is drawing the wrath of the ocean with its descent.																						
78	78		301									Water is now invading the city.																						
79	79		302								What is going on?!	80																						
80	80		301									Vera does not answer you. She just grabs ahold of your arm and pulls you behind her. Her body is tense, like a guard dog sensing danger.																						
81	81		301									You soon understand what is making her nervous and defensive.																						
82	82		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					A swarm of Corrupted follows the invading waves and appears around the landing pad, climbing up from the sea.
