78	78		301							1		A man with scars and a rank slide comes at me and nods. I contacted him when my squad retreated from the frontline. According to the order I received—from the World Government—I need to regroup here, and help him do some training if possible.																						
79	79		301								Officer	Bill, Lieutenant. Greetings, Officer Yelena, your supplies are all ready. We are short of medics at the frontline, so I am hoping you can give ours a little training. They don't have a lot of combat experience.	2																					
80	80		301									He pauses when he sees the sparks on my arm.																						
81	81		301								Officer	Your arm...	2																					
82	82		301								Yelena	The World Government sent you special medical packs in advance, didn't it? That will work for me.	1																					
83	83		301									He continues to gaze at me with suspicion, trying to find out the difference between me and normal humans.																						
84	84		301									Machines like me... Or, using the proper name, "Constructs", are yet to be deployed on a large scale. I'm not surprised at his attitude.																						
85	85		301								Officer	Alright... I'll send someone to get it for you.	2																					
86	86		202							1	2				1																			
87	87		301									He walks away. With an arm hung in a sling, I look around the camp in boredom.																						
88	88		301									Many young soldiers, obviously rookies, are sneaking at me like high school students.																						
89	89		301									A few medics are standing around the wounded soldiers, giving them morphine and antibiotics in a spin. Back in the Golden Age, they were still kids. Now they have to protect their homeland in doomsday.																						
90	90		201							1	500054																							
91	91		301							1		A white-haired medic catches my attention. Unlike her panicking peers, she just half-kneels next to Charlo's (the guy who lost his legs) bed, holding his hand.																						
92	92		202							1					1																			
93	93		301									Charlo looks furious and is screaming in despair. Someone must have touched his nerve again.																						
94	94		301									He is the worst type of patient to medics, at least to me. If it's me, I will probably punch him in the face to shut him up. We are always short of time in war. I don't need more negative emotions to remind me how screwed up this world is.																						
95	95		301									The medic does not touch his wounds but holds his hand instead. She seems to be calming him down with gentle words. Like a pediatrician, she is soothing Charlo's emotions with a kind smile and great patience.																						
96	96		301									I can't hear what she is saying, but Charlo does calm down. The man sobs like a child before his mother, giving the medic a chance to inject a tranquilizer. Her action is gentle and firm but way too slow. I'd have given her a dressing-down for days were she my student. She must have never been to the frontline.																						
97	97		301									She takes a long time to treat Charlo—I could have treated five soldiers in that time—then stands up and looks at the other wounded with visible compassion. Surprised, I even begin to think that she is a believer. I have seen many soldiers with faith, but never one with such a kind and gentle expression.																						
98	98		301									The emotions I see are usually anxiety, grief, despair, or indifference.

101	101		301							1	Soldier	Excuse me, Ma'am... Lieutenant asked me to deliver this medical pack...	2																					
102	102		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					A gloomy-faced soldier interrupts my thoughts. He can't even finish his sentence without stuttering. I take the medical pack, hoping they don't give this guy to me in the training.

104	104		202						2000	1	2				1																			
105	105		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Well, Gloomy Face and the frail medic both end up on my team. Lucky me.																						
106	106		301									It's hard for me to not remember them, for they are always the worst performers in every training class of mine.																						
107	107		301									To be fair, the medic isn't that bad. She passes most courses adequately and is quite smart. The problem is the medic course. Though she pays great attention to details, she is way too slow. Besides, her fitness and shooting scores are atrocious—just a tad better than Gloomy Face.																						
108	108		301									By the time she finishes running 10 laps, all the other soldiers have finished their training and lunch. Every time when Gloomy Face is already half-dead and lying on his back, she would just keep running with a pale face and blue lips, as if she can pass away any second.																						
109	109		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She was probably a princess who rarely did exercise before the war. I ask her to train her endurance first; I don't want her to drop dead half-way.

122	122		301							1	Yelena	Don't give me that look. I'm not the one who will kill you on the battlefield. Maybe you can start practicing how to beg those Corrupted for mercy.	1																					
123	123		301									There is scattered laughter from the soldiers. I raise my voice.

125	125		301								Yelena	You think you are good, huh? Show me! Does anybody fancy a freestyle fight?	1																					
126	126		301									Perhaps my steel arms are too much of a deterrence. All the soldiers look down, nobody dares to reply.																						
127	127		301								Yelena	I can't believe we have to rely on you cowards to save Earth! Don't you know what you have on your shoulders? You are soldiers! And you better **** act like one!	1

142	142		301							1	Yelena	I lost twenty-three soldiers for one base. Have you seen what the survivors look like? Guess what, they are going back to the battlefield with you.	1																					
143	143		301								Yelena	They lost their arms and legs there, but they never put down their weapons! Some crawled and held grenades in their mouths! And they're still going back to the hell that almost claimed their lives. One, two, three, or four times, we go back as long as we are not dead. Because that is what soldiers do!	1																					
144	144		201							1	500054																							
145	145		301							1		Some soldiers look away in shame, some look up and stare into the distance. Only that medic gazes at me as if she has something to say.																						
146	146		201							1	500409																							
147	147		301							1	Yelena	But what are you doing here? Ask yourself, do you deserve this uniform? I don't care why you came here, but if you're here, you've got to toughen up. Our homeland, our Earth, our family, and our friends are behind us! We protect them with our life and blood!	1																					
148	148		301								Yelena	Who else can stand out if we shrink back? Who else can keep fighting if we give up? I remember every single soldier I lost on my team. Their looks, names, what they like to do, and the lives they have lived. I take pride in them. They die with honor.	1																					
149	149		301									I shouldn't let it happen, but I think my voice is shaking a bit. It is the first time that I ever talk about my soldiers after that meat grinder battle.

163	163		301								Medic	I'm the medic of Squad 6... Can I ask you a few questions?	2																					
164	164		301								Yelena	Say it.	1																					
165	165		301								Medic	My training results aren't very good... I'm worried that I can't help the soldiers with my performance. This really troubles me...	2																					
166	166		301									She is shy but genuine. I look her in the eye and can feel she is seriously concerned.																						
167	167		301								Medic	I know it's not nice to disturb you in your personal time... But I really hope you can show me how I can do more.	2																					
168	168		202							1	2				1																			
169	169		301									I was thinking that she wanted to talk about the fear of death, or ask if she could go home. I have realized my mistake, and I respect her resolution.

173	173		301							1	Yelena	Just follow the training schedule and do your best. Everyone has different physical conditions. Passing the military service requirements only means you have met the basic standards, not that you are great at fighting.	1																					
174	174		301								Medic	I see... But, Officer...	2																					
175	175		301									She lowers her head. I sense sorrow in her voice.																						
176	176		301								Medic	I know we are heading to the frontline soon, and I won't have much time to improve. It's my fault for not working hard enough...	2																					
177	177		204							2	5																							
178	178		301									She seems to have struggled a lot inside. When she finally looks at me again, I see her determination.																						
179	179		301								Medic	The wounded soldiers you brought back... I have never seen anything so horrifying and tragic. I think I'm not good enough for the real battlefield, so I'd like to do something... I want to do anything as long as it helps our battle.	2																					
180	180		301									I think for a while.																						
181	181		301								Yelena	I see. Your biggest problem right now is the lack of experience. Your stamina, overall combat abilities, and reflex are also sub-par.	1																					
182	182		204							2	6																							
183	183		301								Medic	I... Is that so...? Sorry...	2																					
184	184		301								Yelena	I watched your training. Every time you had to treat a wound, you always did the full procedure. Given the chance, you'd even wash the dressing! This is a war, not a clinic. You must give up the unnecessary steps. Only life matters, everything else can be sacrificed.	1																					
185	185		301								Yelena	Speaking of it, your technique looks like that of a professional. Have you learned it before?	1																					
186	186		204							2																								
187	187		301								Medic	...My father runs a medical group, so I knew a thing or two about it...	2																					
188	188		301									She sounds a bit hesitant, so I change the topic.																						
189	189		301								Yelena	You must increase your speed. Remember which wounds can be fatal, which ones are not, and which ones can significantly hinder the movement of soldiers. I will design your training accordingly.	1																					
190	190		301								Yelena	Change your fighting style. It's too soft now. Never make a decision that you may regret on the battlefield.	1																					
191	191		301								Medic	Understood.	2																					
192	192		301								Yelena	Medics keep an army going. The Corrupted will not choose their opponents, so you have an equal chance of being attacked just like other soldiers. It's important to keep yourself alive, but you can't fight.	1																					
193	193		301								Medic	Um... What should I do then...	2																					
194	194		301								Yelena	Run. If you can't beat them, just run as far as you can. Don't let the Corrupted touch you.	1																					
195	195		301								Yelena	Of course, I'm not asking you to flee.	1																					
196	196		301								Yelena	You must learn the attacking styles and logic of the common Corrupted. They can't think, but most ordinary machines will attack according to their default program logic, so there are patterns. I have outlined the general guidelines, make sure you remember every response for different situations.	1																					
197	197		301								Medic	I see.	2																					
198	198		301								Yelena	One more thing. If you can't save someone, just let them go.	1																					
199	199		301								Medic	...	2																					
200	200		301								Yelena	Know your limits and choose the plan with the highest returns. Give up one, you may be able to save ten more. But if you are dead, you can't save anyone.	1																					
201	201		204							2	5																							
202	202		301								Medic	...I understand.	2

215	215		301									The bed in front of me is a mess. The water bottle on the bedside table originally had a few flowers inside, but it is knocked over with pink petals scattered everywhere. The belongings of the bed owner are ripped open. Dresses are thrown on the floor, among which is an eye-catching, gorgeous white dress.

222	222		301							1		I pick up the dress and feel very puzzled.

227	227		301							1		Someone sneers but immediately shuts up when I look over.																						
228	228		301									I toss the dress away and feel a pain in the neck. This probably isn't the work of one or two, but a group bully. And I probably can guess why looking at the way this bed is made.																						
229	229		301									The soldiers suddenly look away. I turn around and see the medic.

232	232		301							1		She is still panting, sweat running down her cheeks. Seems like she just went for a jog. She takes off her cap, wipes her forehead, and puts it back on again. She looks me straight in the eye and continues walking in without any fear.																						
233	233		301									I realize my guess is wrong again. Somehow, I feel a little guilty watching her quietly walk to the bed and pick the dress up.																						
234	234		201							1	500409																							
235	235		301							1	Yelena	□□□, who did this?	1																					
236	236		301									It's the first time I call her name. She shakes her head without saying a word. She only packs up her belongings in silence. This attitude is only going to make the bully worse. I must do something.																						
237	237		204							1	5																							
238	238		301								Yelena	...Whoever did this, you had the guts to do it but don't dare to admit? Get the **** out before I find out myself!	1

240	240		301							1	Medic	Ma'am... It's me, sorry. I was looking for something before heading out.	1

255	255		301									I figure out what she wants: to resolve the situation by herself without relying on my power.

260	260		301								Yelena	And you, medic. Pack up your pretty dress. There's no ball here. The only ones you can dance with are the enemies of humanity.	1

266	266		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						But I don't go away. When I see the medic come out to throw the rubbish, I wave at her.

272	272		301									Her face immediately turns even redder.																						
273	273		301								Medic	W... What's the matter...?	2																					
274	274		301									She reluctantly reaches her arm out.																						
275	275		301									I grab her hand and roll her sleeve up. There are red needle marks throughout her pale skin. I even see stitch marks covered under the gauze sponge.																						
276	276		301								Medic	...Ma'am...	2																					
277	277		301									I saw the marks on the back of her hand, but didn't expect her to go so overboard.																						
278	278		301								Yelena	What are you doing?	1																					
279	279		301								Medic	I was just... practicing...	2																					
280	280		301									She takes back her arm and pulls the sleeve down.																						
281	281		204							2																								
282	282		301								Medic	I can find the spot faster now. I also know how to make it hurt less...	2																					
283	283		301								Yelena	I asked you to train hard, not on yourself! How smart, huh?	1																					
284	284		301								Medic	D...Don't worry, Ma'am. I only use glucose. It won't hurt my body... I found your advice very useful. I'm learning a lot faster from these targeted exercises. With better efficiency, I'll be able to...	2																					
285	285		301									I too am a medic, but I just happened to become one. I'm no "doctor" or "teacher"; "fighter" may be a better description. But I can read from this kid's eyes that she wants to save lives. That's our greatest difference.																						
286	286		301									I feel like saying something, but don't know what to say. I'm never good at sympathizing, but at this very moment, I'm a bit emotional. Why would a kid like her step into the battlefield?																						
287	287		301									In the end, all I do is pat her on the shoulder.																						
288	288		301								Yelena	Don't push yourself too hard. If you collapse before even going to the frontline, all my effort will go down the drain!	1																					
289	289		301								Medic	Understood! I will not fail you, Ma'am!	2																					
290	290		301								Medic	Oh, one more thing, Ma'am... Sorry that I brought a dress into the camp...	2																					
291	291		301								Yelena	As long as it's not prohibited, nobody gets to decide what you bring to the army. No one has the right to criticize you so long as you are fulfilling the duty of a soldier.	1																					
292	292		204							2	1																							
293	293		301									I meant every word I said. She smiles gratefully, but I feel she is a little sad underneath.																						
294	294		301								Medic	Thank you, Ma'am. I will never do it again.	2																					
295	295		301								Medic	I'm a soldier now... I shouldn't live in the past anymore.	2																					
296	296		301								Medic	I have found my place. I will take this responsibility.	2																					
297	297		301									I don't know what she is talking about, but I can see her determination. I nod in approval.																						
298	298		301								Yelena	We are going to the frontline soon. Now, I will give you your first order.	1																					
299	299		204							2

302	302		301								Yelena	Private □□□!	1																					
303	303		301									I call out her name with all seriousness. Shocked, she quickly stands to attention and salutes. Her cap isn't worn properly, but she does not realize it.																						
304	304		301								Medic	Yes Ma'am!	2																					
305	305		301								Yelena	Do not die.	1

313	313		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The peaceful time flies by. I have returned to the base near the Central Purification Filter once again with my army. Most of the base has fallen, our final defense moves closer to the CPF day by day.																						
314	314		301									If the Corrupted seizes any more land, the entire zone will fall. We will have to abandon the CPF, and mankind will lose another important base.																						
315	315		301									It is the first time for my soldiers to face such a dire war. There are a lot of casualties.																						
316	316		301									I have to maintain the morale with a great deal of motivation and rebuke.																						
317	317		301									The soldiers charge forward, only to be crushed by numerous Corrupted who are always relentless. They didn't even get to see what the war is like. Years of life, months of training, all destroyed in seconds.																						
318	318		301									The first confrontation lasted over ten hours. My stupid arm stopped functioning again. I bend my body in the trench and quickly move toward a soldier. One of her arms is mutilated in an explosion.

323	323		301							1		I shove my machine gun into her arms and order her to eliminate the Corrupted approaching, then take out a hemostatic patch with my functioning hand to give her emergency treatment.																						
324	324		202							1																								
325	325		301									She gnashes her teeth and shoots, knocked behind by the recoil. I don't hear the sound of bullets hitting the target. A stray bullet flies past my cheek. I feel like my artificial skin is burned, vital fluid coming out.																						
326	326		301									After I finish patching her up, I take the gun back and bring it to my shoulder. A large machine falls to the ground only steps away from our position, sending dust on my face.																						
327	327		301									I wipe my face and hear someone calling for medic from afar.																						
328	328		201							1	500409																							
329	329		301							1	Yelena	Move over there. It's safe behind cover.	1																					
330	330		401							2	1515																							
331	331		301									I pick up the gun she dropped and give it back to her, then look at where the voice comes from.																						
332	332		301									The zooming function of my vision module quickly helps me locate the source of the voice. It's that kid with the gloomy face. He's sitting under a wrecked building, soaked in blood. My fluoroscope tells me he has a broken tailbone and cannot move on his own.																						
333	333		401							2	1515																							
334	334		301									58 meters... No, that cover can't be used anymore. The next closest one is 362 meters away.																						
335	335		301									I decided to give up on him.																						
336	336		401							2	1543																							
337	337		301									Just as I reload my gun, I see a white-haired soldier leaping over the trench from the corner of my eye.																						
338	338		201							1	500409	5																						
339	339		301							1	Yelena	****... □□□!	1																					
340	340		301									I quickly shout to her. She was appointed to stay behind the trench and take care of the incapacitated soldiers.																						
341	341		301								Yelena	Get back here! You can't save him!!	1																					
342	342		301									She doesn't seem to hear me. Instead, she keeps running toward the storm of bullets.

347	347		301			RImgBg1Shake						She only pauses for a second, but a shell from another large Corrupted explodes and knocks her away, tossing her onto a pile of gravel. Dammit! I can still make it. I point my gun at the Corrupted approaching her.																						
348	348		301									There is zero hesitation in her action. She quickly gets back on her feet and dashes out like a wild deer, heading toward the voice calling for help.

352	352		301									I blow the Corrupted into pieces, but more have located her. I can't help her.																						
353	353		301									There's no way she can reach there.																						
354	354		202							1					1																			
355	355		301									I can only watch her run rapidly across the battlefield. I never know she can run so fast already. She goes around the unsafe cover in the same route I anticipated. She is sprinting with all her strength, leaving gunfire and explosions behind.																						
356	356		301									Somehow, all the bullets are missing this frail medic. It's almost a miracle. She continues to run in the center of the battlefield. I swear that I couldn't run as fast when I was still a human.																						
357	357		301									She soon reaches the soldier. My hearing module catches his desperate screams. She pulls him to a safer location before giving him emergency treatment.																						
358	358		301									For one instant, I almost forget my duty. I just gaze at her as she does her job skillfully, almost half as fast as me. She must have been doing a lot of training.																						
359	359		301									I feel like I have returned to many years ago. I remember the first prey I shot with my gun. The first time I punched a bully, knocking him to the ground. The first time I climbed to the top of the snow mountain in my hometown, screaming and shouting—																						
360	360		301									I think I have smiled. I have never felt this motivated for so long...																						
361	361		301									It's a cry from our soul, unwilling to give up the impossible challenge.																						
362	362		301									She quickly finishes wrapping his wounds and holds his hand, comforting him with a gentle smile. This part can be skipped. I must tell her later.																						
363	363		401							2	10001004																							
364	364		301									I pick up the machine gun again and shoot down a few Corrupted in front. My heart beating incredibly fast from surging emotions.																						
365	365		201							1	500409	5																						
366	366		301							1		I climb on top of the trench, yelling.

We have no limit. We can conquer the universe, and take back the Earth that belongs to us in the first place.
