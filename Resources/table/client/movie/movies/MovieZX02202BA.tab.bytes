6	6		301								Collins	The stuff we made with Luna's data is nothing but an empty shell.	1

12	12		301								Collins	USE‚ÄîLESS.	1																					
13	13		301									With his sluggish tone, Collins sits up from the desk, loosening his tie and looking at the person reporting to him.																						
14	14		301								Collins	I've never wanted another powerful Construct.	1																					
15	15		301								Collins	What I want is to get humanity to evolve closer to the Ascendants.	1																					
16	16		301								Collins	Don't you get it? If a Construct is an improvement on a human's flesh and bones, then an Ascendant is an extraordinary leap of progress.	1																					
17	17		301								Collins	And that possibility of evolution, the chance to free humanity from its limitations of the last few hundreds of millennia, is hidden inside that agent.	1																					
18	18		301								Collins	It is how we give humanity more leverage on this planet‚Äîno, in this universe.	1																					
19	19		204							2	4																							
20	20		301								Rebecca	It's clearly not something we can decipher for now.	2																					
21	21		301								Collins	Perhaps.	1																					
22	22		301								Collins	But as long as we have Luna with us, we will figure out a way to unlock this treasure trove.	1																					
23	23		301								Rebecca	See, I've been meaning to ask you‚Äîare you not avoiding saying that name anymore?	2																					
24	24		301								Collins	That's not necessary with you.	1																					
25	25		301								Collins	After all, we're tentative partners during this exciting journey of opening a treasure trove.	1																					
26	26		301								Rebecca	Sigh...	2																					
27	27		301								Collins	What? You don't seem excited at all.	1																					
28	28		301								Rebecca	Because this is not the time. Based on our eyes and ears in the Parliament, our situation is quite dire currently. We won't be able to touch the commandant for a while.	2																					
29	29		301								Collins	That's fine. Don't you think this whole ordeal is one of the gifts of the trove as well?	1																					
30	30		301								Collins	That feeling when you have the treasure chest in your hands, but not a single thing you do will budge it. The anxiety and thrill when you can't even find the keyhole.	1																					
31	31		204							1	14																							
32	32		301								Collins	As if ants and insects are crawling and gnawing all over your body, or being engulfed by fire... Hahaha...	1																					
33	33		301									Collins cries a dramatic tear, it gliding along his wrinkles and the two hands covering his chest, leaving a wet mark on his dark-colored suit.																						
34	34		301								Collins	It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, I'm telling you, because you will know that the wait is worth it. You'll know that once you open that chest, you will gain riches that can topple the world.	1																					
35	35		301								Rebecca	But we've lost the only one who can unlock that chest, and this key is being protected by the Parliament right now.	2																					
36	36		301								Rebecca	And you don't look distressed at all.	2																					
37	37		204							1	7																							
38	38		301								Collins	Ouch. How can you say that about me?	1																					
39	39		301								Collins	I'm one of those shepherds that care about their herd, after all.	1																					
40	40		301								Rebecca	One of those that carry a butcher knife, I suppose.	2																					
41	41		204							1																								
42	42		301								Collins	Haha! Regardless, charging into a herd of sheep to snatch one is just going to cause us trouble.	1																					
43	43		301								Collins	One day, our dear „Äêkuroname„Äë will find a way back into our sack.	1																					
44	44		301								Collins	One day.	1																					
45	45		301									Collins chews over his words, his gaze traveling past Rebecca into the distance.																						
46	46		301								Rebecca	How about waiting for that day with a little class?	2																					
47	47		301								Collins	Hahaha, of course.	1																					
48	48		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Collins takes his time to jump off the table, taking a bow in a way he thinks elegant, before heading to a compartment to the side.																						
49	49		401							2	753																							
50	50		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						A few moments later, he steps out with a new suit that looks identical to his old one.																						
51	51		301								Rebecca	Do you only have one style of suit?	2																					
52	52		301								Collins	Clothes are just cages of morality that humanity locks themselves in.	1																					
53	53		301								Collins	All it does is distinguish us from the monkeys in the zoos, making us look more civilized.	1																					
54	54		301								Collins	Would you care about what your cage looks like?	1																					
55	55		301								Rebecca	I can't agree with that.	2																					
56	56		301								Collins	That's alright. I was just expressing my opinions, not looking for approval.	1																					
57	57		301								Collins	Everyone expresses themselves with their eyes, their actions, and their posture as long as they live. I simply choose to express myself with words.	1																					
58	58		301								Collins	How about you? What do you think?	1																					
59	59		301								Rebecca	What do I think about what?	2																					
60	60		301								Collins	This "floating treasure" the Parliament is hiding.	1																					
61	61		301								Rebecca	I'm still not sure what it is, but thanks to what you did, the Parliament has retrieved quite a number of things.	2																					
62	62		301								Collins	Oooh, loots!	1																					
63	63		301									Collins closes his eyes, his figure gently tapping on his temple.																						
64	64		204							1	7																							
65	65		301							1	Collins	How dare you, Nicky...	1																					
66	66		301								Collins	Now I'm even more eager to see what you will reap. Oh, the anticipation!	1																					
67	67		204							1																								
68	68		301								Collins	I'll leave it up to you, our dear socialite, the time we collect the fruit of their labor.	1

74	74		301									Collins laughs as he pushes open the door and walks away, leaving Rebecca alone in the study.																						
75	75		301									She takes a look at the terminal Collins has left on the desk. The monitor keeps flickering as it refreshes the different confidential journals the Science Council has submitted to the Parliament.																						
76	76		301								Rebecca	Seriously? He's still the same after all these years.	2

90	90		301							1	Hilda	Due to the clearance level required, we have monitored the entire process of researching the Omega File.	1																					
91	91		301								Hilda	During the process, the Science Council followed the experiment approaches recorded in the Omega File.	1																					
92	92		301								Hilda	Combining the research data Lustrous and the rest left behind, they were making attempts non-stop day and night.	1																					
93	93		301								Hilda	Eventually, they reproduced the phenomenon the Atlantis researchers observed.	1																					
94	94		201							1	500011																							
95	95		301							1	Hassen	That means... the Punishing Virus can indeed be "absorbed"...	1																					
96	96		202							1					1																			
97	97		301									Hassen can feel his voice shaking as he says it out loud.																						
98	98		301									Everyone in the room understands what that represents.																						
99	99		301									The Punishing Virus, the bane of humanity's exile from Earth, is now something that can be eliminated.																						
100	100		301									This long, drawn-out war has finally seen a hopeful glimpse of victory. Humans finally have a chance to reclaim Earth.																						
101	101		301									And the prices paid in the past have not been in vain. All those sacrifices can finally see redemptions.																						
102	102		201							1	500352																							
103	103		301							1	Hilda	Atlantis has passed us a torch of hope, and its flame will light the fire that burns away the Punishing Virus on our planet.	1

105	105		301							1	Nikola	(Exhales) ...	1																					
106	106		301									Nikola also expresses a hint of being moved. He closes his eyes slowly, remembering all the little things from the past.																						
107	107		301									Exhaling a deep breath, he breaks the shock and silence in the Parliament room with his resounding voice.																						
108	108		301								Nikola	We know the how, and we can see the finish line.	1																					
109	109		301								Nikola	We don't have any reason to waste time here, then.	1																					
110	110		201							1	500011																							
111	111		301							1	Hassen	Exactly. The Omega File is humanity's treasure. Move the Science Council's resource distribution to the highest level, and prioritize all their needs.	1																					
112	112		301								Hassen	The moment we develop the devices that can absorb the Punishing Virus, humanity will have their strongest weapons to end this war.	1																					
113	113		301									After Hassen issues his command, Nikola's expression returns to his usual coldness.																						
114	114		201							1	500352																							
115	115		301							1	Hilda	Mr. President, don't forget that making a move this big will draw the bloodthirsty sharks lurking underneath.	1

130	130		301								Hassen	I'm sorry to get you involved in our conflict with the extra requests.	1																					
131	131		301								Asimov	That's fine. I just have to make some adjustments to the encryption protocol, and you will have what you need.	2																					
132	132		301								Asimov	The coordinates of the Omega File will now change every millisecond, and the data recorded inside is encrypted every minute.	2																					
133	133		301								Asimov	With all these encryptions overlapping each other, Kurono would have to decrypt tens of thousands of times after just a day if they want to learn anything from it.	2																					
134	134		301								Asimov	If they do decrypt it, the virus I planted inside will trigger, and data from the Kurono network will be sent to a set of data chips on my end.	2																					
135	135		401							2	1515																							
136	136		301									Asimov speaks fast, but he codes even faster. A series of coding commands appears on the monitor soon before he eventually presses the "enter" key with force.																						
137	137		301								Asimov	You've got what you need.	2																					
138	138		301									Asimov has not stopped typing even when he speaks. To him, nothing can interrupt his research on the Omega File now.																						
139	139		301								Asimov	But in order to progress on the actual application of the Omega File, we need more Punishing Virus samples to study.	2																					
140	140		301								Hassen	I see. Knowing the enemy is the only way to make sure we don't miss anything.	1																					
141	141		301								Asimov	Apart from known Corrupted and Ascendants, we also need data from the Hetero-Creatures and the Hetero-Hive Mother. Given the Polyphage is beyond salvaging, the Hetero-Hive Mother remains we got from the sewage are far from enough.	2																					
142	142		301								Hassen	Those remains have all been transferred to the Science Council. I'm afraid we can't give you more.	1																					
143	143		201							1	500352		-500																					
144	144		301							1	Hilda	If we don't have it, we'll just find it.	1																					
145	145		301									Hilda waves the miniature terminal in her hand.																						
146	146		301								Hilda	This is a terminal Asimov sent to the Control Court. Allow me to explain the rest.	1																					
147	147		301								Hilda	It records the abnormal data captured by the Inver-Device from the Glory frame.	1																					
148	148		301								Hilda	During the investigation, the Science Council determined that this abnormal Punishing Virus overload stemmed from the fight between Chrome and the Hive Mother.	1																					
149	149		301								Hilda	During the fight, the Hive Mother maintained a faint connection with an entity beyond the sewage system. That connection was the reason Chrome's Inver-Device overloaded when it shouldn't have.	1																					
150	150		301								Hilda	A similar connection has existed before between the Polyphage and the Pterygota Queen.	1																					
151	151		301								Hilda	Damaging one affects the other, and the wounded side will send out an alert to the surviving side in a way to accumulate experience. Like a defensive mechanism a tribe develops to make sure of its survival.	1																					
152	152		301								Hilda	To know to do that means the Hetero-Creatures have evolved to a fairly high level of intelligence.	1																					
153	153		301								Hilda	The abnormal behavior of Chrome's Inver-Device gave us the data to support that idea. There may be more than one Hetero-Hive Mother... or, frankly put, having multiple bodies is a shared characteristic of all Hetero-Creatures.	1																					
154	154		301								Hilda	The Punishing Virus emulates Earth's ecosystem to establish its own tree of life.	1																					
155	155		301								Hilda	Every branch, every leaf on that tree represents the same Hetero-Creature species at different levels of evolution.	1																					
156	156		201							1	500011		-500																					
157	157		301							1	Hassen	The Task Force has indeed mentioned in their record that Vonnegut said that Hetero-Hive Mother was just a "test subject."	1																					
158	158		301								Asimov	Then we can deduce that there is a "completed" or "most evolved" Hetero-Hive Mother out there, and it's hidden somewhere on the surface.	2																					
159	159		301								Hassen	...	1
