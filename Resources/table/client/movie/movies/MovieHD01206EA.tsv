19	19		301									You made a powerless complaint. Do you still have to pay the kitchen repair bills even in this space?																						
20	20		301								Stove God	I made a mistake with the strength of the explosion. Without enough offering, I couldn't do a lot of things.	1																					
21	21		301								Stove God	Can't think properly when I'm hungry.	1																					
22	22		301								Stove God	On the other hand, if I have receive enough offerings, then everything would be a piece of cake.	1																					
23	23		301								Stove God	Just now, you have provided enough offerings. I can do anything now!	1
