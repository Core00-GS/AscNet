6	6	8	301								Liv	You don't have to repeat yourself, Commandant.	1																					
7	7		301								Liv	Did something happen? What a weird question, Commandant.	1																					
8	8		301								Liv	I'll be waiting for you at the entrance then. Please come over once you're ready.	1

11	11		302								So very packed...	12	Does Liv hate me?	13

16	16		301							1	Lucia	Liv does seem quite different recently, especially when it comes to her personality... Did it begin when she changed to the Lux frame?	2																					
17	17		301								Lee	Switching frames doesn't alter our personality, though. You know that, Lucia.	1																					
18	18		301								Lucia	Which is why I'm as perplexed as the commandant regarding why Liv is acting the way she is now.	2																					
19	19		302								She feels like how Lucia used to be.	20	Can't be puberty, can it?	22																				
20	20		301								Lucia	How I used to be?	2																					
21	21	24	301								Lee	The way you were meticulous and diligent, I suppose. And maybe a little inapproachable.	1																					
22	22		301								Lee	Puberty? What do you think we are? Kids?	1																					
23	23		301								Lee	I don't think we'll go through that kind of mental transition.	1

26	26		301							1	Liv	Commandant, I've been waiting outside the base for ten minutes. It's time for the mission to begin.	1																					
27	27		301								Liv	I thought you must have received an urgent mission.	1																					
28	28		301								Liv	As much as I agree with the importance of communicating with your teammates, I don't think it's worth delaying a mission.	1																					
29	29		301								Liv	You can understand, can't you?	1																					
30	30		302								I understand...	31	Liv, there's something I want to discuss with you.	31

32	32		301							1	Lucia	Commandant, let's just go on the mission with Liv for now.	1																					
33	33		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	We'll pay more attention to her behavior in the process. I'm sure we'll find out why she's changed.	1
