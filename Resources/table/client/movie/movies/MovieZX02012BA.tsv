3	3		301			DialogEnable						Their deafening rotor blades spinning, several transport crafts land on the field before you. A troop of Constructs in black walk out, armed with unrecognizable weapons, and flank Cerberus in a pincer movement.																						
4	4		301									Alarmed, both No. 21 and Noctis tense up. Vera, however, does not appear startled at all, looking at the leading Kurono Construct with disdain.																						
5	5		201							1	500019																							
6	6		301							1	Kurono Construct	Your operation has been terminated. Put down your weapons and follow our orders. We'll take over here.	1																					
7	7		301									His voice is cold, his command leaving no room for bargain.																						
8	8		301									Vera holds back the irritated Noctis, and she looks at the Construct arrogantly, her head raised high.

10	10		301							1	Vera	Watch your tone. We aren't your guard dogs.	1

15	15		301									Impatient with their typical Kurono talk, Vera narrows her eyes and stares at the Constructs behind him. She is about to say something—																						
16	16		301									But—																						
17	17		301									Her expression changes for a second, and the vicious mockery she has prepared turns into a disdainful sneer.																						
18	18		201							1	500168	1																						
19	19		301							1	Vera	Alright. We understand.	1																					
20	20		202							1					1																			
21	21		301									It is not like her to follow orders. Noticing that, No. 21 does not question any further. Noctis, grumpy as he is, also detects it and remains silent. For once, the three are in sync in the face of the unknown.																						
22	22		301									Constructs in black and more black-clad agents depart the landing transport crafts, setting up quarantine zones, disinfection chambers, laboratories, and temporary accommodations.																						
23	23		301									They announce the end of your mission. "Finding Luna" seems to have disappeared into thin air from the mission logs, and the men in black are now surrounding the area, trying to track down Vonnegut.																						
24	24		301									Cerberus, in turn, is surrounded by the Kurono agents, being questioned on the information of the new enemy.																						
25	25		301									No. 21 takes a look back at the estate.

36	36		301			DialogEnable					No. 21	Okay.	1																					
37	37		301									Not far from her, more figures in black walk out of the transport crafts, removing the remote connection nodes. Vera and Noctis are standing by the side, talking to a human in uniform.

52	52		301									The white-haired Construct speaks first, direct and honest, as she has always been.

66	66		302								The urge to protect?	67																						
67	67		301								No. 21	Was that urge someone else's, or was it mine? I can't figure it out.	1

81	81		301									No. 21 asks this question once more.																						
82	82		302								They...	83																						
83	83		301									They survived that ordeal. The worse had yet to come back then, and they had survived whatever came next. Despite being separated by fate, they have both survived until now. But is this the answer No. 21 is looking for?																						
84	84		302								They've both found where they belong.	85

94	94		301									Then she sees herself in the mirror. She is wearing a white, soft pajama, her hair tied in a pink bow. In her arms is a Co-Bot-looking stuffed toy, furry and round.																						
95	95		301									She looks like a stranger, incapable of defending herself. But in her imagination, No. 21 knows that there will be no danger.																						
96	96		301									She smiles. She wants to be like the other girls. She wants to smile like daisies, innocent and harmless.

153	156		301									You look up and find yourself alone in the small room. A few figures stand in the shadow on the other side of the glass window like little demons guarding the gate of hell, trying to feast on those passing by.

168	171		301									You sit back down and rest your head on your hands. You want to ask about Kurono's plan for you after this, but it is evidently futile, considering the faceless, armed figures standing before you.																						
169	172		301									In this brief moment of respite, the gears in your brain start turning.																						
170	173		301									Kurono's mission has clearly not been locating Luna. They picked this town, and your reactions were part of their plan.

173	176	178	301									Kurono has been suspecting it. They are trying to gather evidence.																						
174	177		301									Kurono seems to know everything about you.																						
175	178		301									If they compare the visual data during a connection, Kurono can easily deduce that you might have been "stained" by Luna's memories somehow.																						
176	179		301									Not that you can control those memory replays anyway...

178	181	183	301									No... Even if you have indeed imported her memories, it is still impossible to extract a Construct's memory from a human brain.																						
179	182		301									They are ambitious, that is for sure.																						
180	183		301									You still have so many questions regarding this operation. The Ascendant that has been guiding Roland... was it an accident that she ran into Cerberus? Vera knows more than she has been letting on.																						
181	184		301									Did Luna really go there after that battle? Then who was fighting her? Ever since you entered the town, those hallucinations became clearer and clearer. What is the connection between them?																						
182	185		301									Countless questions occupy your mind. At the very least, the most important one is answered.
