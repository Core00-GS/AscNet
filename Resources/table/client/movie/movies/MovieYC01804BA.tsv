19	19		301							1	Lucia	Apologies, Commandant.	1																					
20	20		302								Why are you apologizing?	21																						
21	21		301								Lucia	Whether it be for acting on my own accord at HQ or for failing to make the right call just nowâ€”I failed my duty as captain.	1																					
22	22		301								Lucia	I always have to rely on you to come save the day, Commandant.	1																					
23	500		204							1	3																							
24	23		301								Lucia	As captain of the Gray Ravens, I should be able to lighten your burden.	1

26	25		302								No, you've only imposed that upon yourself.	26																						
27	26		301								Lucia	I don't get it.	1																					
28	27		302								What matters most is that we fight for a common goal.	28																						
29	28		301								Lucia	Sounds like a form of consequentialism.	1																					
30	29		302								While fighting for this goal, there are certain things only you are capable of doing, Lucia.	30																						
31	30		301				DialogDisable				Lucia	Only me?	1																					
32	31		302								Don't just focus on your mistakes.	32

56	54		301								Lucia	...Understood.	1																					
57	55		301								Lucia	Lee and I will split up to cover 35th Street and 42nd Street. Liv stay here with the commandant and provide long-ranged support.	1																					
58	56		301								Lee	Huh? But before, didn't you...	2																					
59	57		301								Lucia	There are numerous factors we need to account for on the battlefield when devising an attack plan.	1																					
60	58		301								Lucia	I think your assessment is right, Lee.	1																					
61	59		301								Lucia	Liv doesn't excel in close-quarter combat. Not to mention, she exhausted her Levi-Gun while rescuing you from the pit. She should come around with the commandant at her side.	1

63	61		301								Liv	Sorry for... slowing everyone down.	3

66	63		301								Lee	Oh?	2																					
67	64		301									Hearing this, Lee is lost in thought for a few moments before returning to his usual expression. Liv puts her hands to her chest and looks down in hesitation.																						
68	65		301								Liv	Everyone...	3																					
69	66		302								Well, it's decided then!	67
