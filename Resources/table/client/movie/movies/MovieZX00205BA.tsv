24	23		301							1	Vera	Hey there, congratulations.	2																					
25	24		301								Lee	I think you owe us an explanation. Weren't you trying to take down the "Iron Maiden"?	1																					
26	25		301								Vera	Little Tifa is right by our side here, dear.	2																					
27	26		301								Lee	What?	1																					
28	27		301								Vera	I never said a thing about her being around that signal.	2																					
29	28		301								Lee	So you said all that to misdirect us?	1																					
30	29		301								Vera	Ex-act-ly.	2																					
31	30		301								Vera	We had to secure our little treat, you know? You all have yourselves to blame—we wouldn't have had to play this little trick if you weren't so efficient on your mission.	2																					
32	31		301								Lee	Impeding the mission like this, how are you going to explain to President Hassen?	1																					
33	32		301								Vera	Compared to the competition within Kurono, that's nothing. You know full well, don't you, Lee?	2																					
34	33		301								Lee	...	1
