6	6		301								Yata	V, what do we do?																						
7	7		301								Valeria	I'll intercept him. Yata, after he leaves, go extract the records to get what we need.																						
8	8		301								Yata	You know you're very not commandant-like, yeah? You're a human, but you keep doing things a vanguard or a scout would do.																						
9	9		301								Valeria	So?																						
10	10		301								Yata	How long have we been working together?																						
11	11		301								Valeria	3 years, 8 months, and 12 days. If you're referring to when you got into this frame, then...																						
12	12		301								Yata	Have you ever thought about when you'll die?																						
13	13		301								Valeria	Why would I ever think about that?																						
14	14		301									Valeria replies with an almost steel-like resoluteness. Yata decides to stop asking further.																						
15	15		301								Valeria	Asimov, Yata will act as a proxy for you. You know what to do.

17	17		301							1	Asimov	I got the proxy signal... Wait, that's...?!	1																					
18	18		301								Valeria	What's wrong?																						
19	20		301								Asimov	No... It's nothing.	1																					
20	21		301								Asimov	(Why would that database hijack program I made for fun from a few years ago be here?)																						
21	22		301								Asimov	(The invader that the Scarab Squad is monitoring... That's someone from Babylonia, or maybe a member of the Science Council?)																						
22	23		301								Valeria	What's the matter, Chief Technician?																						
23	24		301								Asimov	...Just go on with your mission.	1																					
24	25		301								Valeria	...																						
25	26		301								Yata	You aren't... hiding anything from us, are you?

30	32		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		Successfully hacking into the database, a stream of data flows into Murray's terminal through his data avatar.																						
31	33		301								Murray	Verifying ID and... looks like this is the stuff. This must be what the two big guys wanted.	1																					
32	34		301								Murray	Now then, Gestalt's highest clearance database is all bare before me... I can't just leave now, can I?	1																					
33	35		301									Flexing his hands, Murray displays the file catalog before him.																						
34	36		301								Murray	Let's see, keyword... Kurono.	1																					
35	37		301									Three-fifths of the data vanishes. The rest forms a colossal matrix before Murray's eyes.																						
36	38		301								Murray	Second keyword... Construct Tech.	1																					
37	39		301									Another two-thirds of the files vanish. The rest reorganize themselves into a gargantuan matrix that would still take at least an entire day to go through.																						
38	40		301								Murray	...Should I bring all this back? Just transferring the files will take ages.	1																					
39	41		301								Murray	In that case, let's add more filters.	1																					
40	42		301								Murray	Digital signatures of Hassen and Nikola.	1																					
41	43		301									The matrix dissolves into ten or so files, all with the "top secret" tag on them.																						
42	44		301								Murray	There we are.	1																					
43	45		301									Murray waves and transfers them into his terminal.																						
44	46		301									—At which point, he discovers a shadowy figure moving toward him.																						
45	47		301								Murray	...Tch, I knew it wouldn't go so well!	1																					
46	48		301									Murray extracts a program from his terminal and sends it toward the pursuer.																						
47	49		301									—Bzzz!																						
48	50		301									The program expands into an electric net, blocking the pursuer's path.																						
49	51		301								Murray	Thanks for catching up! But sorry, gotta go!	1																					
50	52		202							1					1																			
51	53		301									Murray bolts and escapes.																						
52	54		301									Physical conditions in the real world do not translate to a consciousness diving in virtual space, so Murray manages to run at full speed in a rare occurrence.																						
53	55		301									This, coupled with the electric net program, should allow him to completely lose the pursuer. Or so he thought.																						
54	56		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					He does not recall if he has erased the access logs—not that he had the time to check.
