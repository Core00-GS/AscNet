10	10		301									Flora sits on the floor, holding out a hand toward Selena.																						
11	11		301									An invitation to dance, this the same gesture the protagonist does before the curtain call.																						
12	12		301									Flora holds on to her pose for a very long time, her expression not shifting a bit.																						
13	13		301									Does she not want the show to end? Selena wonders, thinking that there must be a stubbornness inside this girl that carries her across a barren desert to these ruins, performing over and over despite the pain from the infection.																						
14	14		301									Selena must protect a heart so frail and resilient.																						
15	15		301									Thinking that, Selena performs the same gesture, and the two of them stand still.																						
16	16		301									Standing... still...																						
17	17		201							1	500433	8																						
18	18		301							1	Flora	Aargh... My arm is getting sore! Why aren't we bowing?	1																					
19	19		301									Flora's quiet complaint makes Selena realizes that Flora is not demonstrating her stubbornness. She simply thinks that all actors cannot move before the final bow.																						
20	20		201							1	500430	2																						
21	21		301							1	Selena	...Right. This is the end of "The Acadia Evacuation". Thank you for watching.	1																					
22	22		202							1					1																			
23	23		301									Selena mimics the motion of pulling the curtain down. Flora's tense body relaxes as the imaginary curtains fall, and her somber expression turns into joy.																						
24	24		201							1	500433	2																						
25	25		301							1	Flora	Whoa... that was great! So great! I know I missed a lot of lines, but it felt so wonderful to perform a full act!	1																					
26	26		301								Flora	Thank you, Miss! You're my first audience!	1																					
27	27		301								Flora	I have to... offer you... my gratitude. This way, Mom would...	1																					
28	28		202							1					1																			
29	29		301									Her voice suddenly dwindles, and her young body falls. Selena manages to catch her before she faints and falls to the ground.																						
30	30		301									Disordered breaths, signs of infection, hunger, and cold—all of them take their toll the moment the performance is completed.																						
31	31		301									Selena manages to inject Flora with a serum in time, giving the girl water with her waterskin.																						
32	32		201							1	500433	8	-350																					
33	33		201							2	500430	4	350																					
34	34		301							1	Flora	Hah... Ugh...	1																					
35	35		301								Selena	Flora... you need to rest.	2																					
36	36		301								Flora	Y-yes... I can rest now...	1																					
37	37		301									Her voice is weak but still joyous.																						
38	38		301								Flora	T-then, Miss... c-can you tell me... how you feel... about our performance together?	1																					
39	39		204							2	2																							
40	40		301								Selena	Of course... Your performance was perfect. Thank you for doing it.	2																					
41	41		301								Flora	Really... That's great. Do you think Mom will... feel better... after she sees it...	1																					
42	42		301									A child can be more stubborn than an adult sometimes.																						
43	43		301									Selena was ready for this small, unyielding spirit.																						
44	44		301								Selena	...Actually, there is more to this story... Do you want to know how it truly ends?	2																					
45	45		202							1	2				1																			
46	46		301									Hearing about an ending to the story, Flora's dull eyes glisten again. Her trembling lips have not even opened, and Selena knows what her answer will be.																						
47	47		301									Selena supports Flora's body with one hand and opens her terminal with another.																						
48	48		301									Quietly she tells Flora a story the way she did with the children in the conservation area.																						
49	49		301									The real ending of "The Acadia Evacuation".																						
50	50		301									This ending does not change any prior plot, but it completely alters the theme of the opera.																						
51	51		301									The dying soldier who stayed on the surface gave the ones departing for Babylonia his blessings.																						
52	52		301									With unregretful death and sacrifice, as well as hope for the future, he died as the opera ended.																						
53	53		301									—But that was just the fantasy of those who lived.																						
54	54		301									The people from Babylonia were praising how noble the soldiers' sacrifices were—until they received the dying soldiers' messages, revealing how painful and regretful the soldiers felt.																						
55	55		301									And these feelings spread to those who saw the messages.																						
56	56		301									Regrets and shame flooded their hearts, followed by indifference—a way to protect themselves.																						
57	57		201							1	500433		-350																					
58	58		201							2	500430	4	350																					
59	59		301							1	Selena	...That is it.	2																					
60	60		301								Flora	That's... the real ending?	1																					
61	61		301									Flora mumbles, voicing her first thought. She has recovered much with the serum and water, but she is still leaning in Selena's arm.																						
62	62		301								Flora	But... but why?	1																					
63	63		301								Flora	I don't get it... I don't understand why the writer would think that way...	1																					
64	64		301								Flora	Miss... Do you know? Can you tell me?	1																					
65	65		301								Selena	...Of course.	2																					
66	66		301								Selena	Perhaps she didn't think clearly when she published the first version of the opera... Perhaps she has been through something else that changed her mind, and she gave the story a new ending.	2																					
67	67		301									Regardless of the plot, an author's intent will always reveal itself in the ending.																						
68	68		301									A line from the ending can elevate the story, or it can make the story lingers.																						
69	69		301									Of course an ending can also overturn it.																						
70	70		301								Selena	Legends and spirits are such wonderful things, but not everyone can place them above their lives.	2																					
71	71		301								Selena	The heroic sacrifice might not be the end. The hero might have cried, cursed, or regretted his choice.	2																					
72	72		301								Selena	After all... the story is not the whole truth.	2																					
73	73		301								Flora	Okay...	1																					
74	74		204							1	8																							
75	75		301									Flora closes her eyes. She seems to be thinking, or perhaps she is simply too tired, about to fall asleep.																						
76	76		301									Regardless, Selena has to take her away now. Right as Selena is about to lift her up, however, she jumps from Selena's arms and stands.																						
77	77		301								Flora	Hmm... That's wrong. It's... it's not right!	1																					
78	78		202							1	2				1																			
79	79		301									Flora crouches, still trembling, picking up the paper booklet on the floor. Those are the creased pages of "The Acadia Evacuation", most likely left behind by her father.																						
80	80		201							1	500433																							
81	81		301							1	Flora	The people who stayed behind would feel regretful and hateful... Hmm, that's possible. That makes sense... but still...	1																					
82	82		202							1					1																			
83	83		301									She writes down a few lines on the crumpled paper, turning what Selena said into dialogues.																						
84	84		301									And then she adds a few more lines.																						
85	85		301									Flora works fast. She started with words, but now she is filling the pages with child-like drawings and weird symbols—probably a secret language the girl invented.																						
86	86		301									Writing and drawing, she eventually holds up her script and narrates another new ending after the new ending she just heard.																						
87	87		301									—The grandeur of the sacrificed is just the fantasy of those who lived.																						
88	88		301									The people from Babylonia were praising how noble the soldiers' sacrifices were—until they received the dying soldiers' messages, revealing how painful and regretful the soldiers felt.																						
89	89		301									But the people up there do not ignore this pain.																						
90	90		301									They remember their laments and turn that into the fuel that drives them forward.																						
91	91		301									One after another, squads are sent to the surface from above.																						
92	92		301									When the day of peace and liberation arrives, the returned stand before the soldier's grave, giving him the funeral he deserves. And they say—																						
93	93		201							1	500433																							
94	94		301							1	Flora	—"Farewell, my friends, my family..."	1																					
95	95		301								Flora	—"Elysium-bound you will be, in the future days when you are free."	1																					
96	96		401							1	204																							
97	97		301								Flora	Right. Right! That's how it should be.	1																					
98	98		301								Flora	The people who got sent away will one day understand why the soldier sacrificed himself. They were fighting for the same cause, so that's now the ending should be.	1																					
99	99		301									The child, just recovered, opens up the script with her shaking hands, unveiling the new ending to Selena. Selena, meanwhile, is taken aback.																						
100	100		201							1	500430																							
101	101		301							1	Selena	Is that... the ending you think will come true?	1																					
102	102		201							1	500433																							
103	103		301							1	Flora	Come true? No... I don't think it is.	1																					
104	104		301								Flora	I think... it's the ending that would move me... that would move Dad.	1																					
105	105		301								Flora	I know how the writer felt, but I get to decide how I interpret it. I just think that... even with part of the ending dismissed, there must be more to it when the sacrifice was written so majestically.	1																					
106	106		301								Flora	The stories before the ending made me feel that despite feeling powerless and hurt, the moment they stepped onto the battlefield, the people who sacrificed themselves had received courage... and hope.	1																					
107	107		301								Flora	Passing on this courage and hope was why the writer wrote this opera in the first place. Isn't that enough to understand this? The truth... might be too complicated. The writer might not understand everything when she wrote it.	1																					
108	108		301								Flora	Prospero, Iris, magic... None of them are real, and I don't know why their writer wrote them this way. But they were... nice. They were nice...	1																					
109	109		301								Flora	Isn't... that enough?	1																					
110	110		202							1					1																			
111	111		301									Instead of an answer, Flora receives a hug.																						
112	112		301									Selena embraces her tightly.																						
113	113		201							1	500430	2																						
114	114		301							1	Selena	You're right... That was very well said...	1																					
115	115		301									They are so close that Selena can hear Flora's heart beating in her chest.																						
116	116		301									The same heartbeats as Selena's.																						
117	117		301								Selena	Thank you...	1																					
118	118		201							1	500433																							
119	119		301							1	Flora	Hmph? Why are you thanking me...?	1																					
120	120		202							1					1																			
121	121		301									Once again, Selena does not answer, only holding Flora even tighter.																						
122	122		301									—Thank you for rebutting me and reflecting sincerely. I knew you could do it.																						
123	123		301									—Thank you for saying what I couldn't say. Those words would be too powerless if they came from me.																						
124	124		201							1	500430	2																						
125	125		301							1	Selena	Your ideas will be carried into your work... One day, they will also move someone else.	1																					
126	126		301								Selena	And that's enough. Lost or hurt, this pureness of yours will guide you and guard you. Even when facing adversity... you will outlast the storm.	1																					
127	127		301								Selena	If this war ends one day... you will become an artist with admirable pursuit...	1																					
128	128		301								Selena	I believe... you can do it...	1																					
129	129		201							1	500433																							
130	130		301							1	Flora	Oh... then, thank you, Miss.	1																					
131	131		301								Flora	What you said makes me believe that I... will bring Mom comfort.	1																					
132	132		202							1					1																			
133	133		301									Hazy as she may be, Flora sits up and answers Selena.																						
134	134		201							1	500428																							
135	135		301							1	Pieter	(Chuckles)	1																					
136	136		301									Pieter watches from afar. He is supposed to take Flora back by now. Even with the serum, it is not a good idea for a child to stay somewhere with a low concentration of the Punishing Virus.																						
137	137		301									Instead, he just stays away from the stay, watching the two girls holding each other.																						
138	138		301									Selena does not notice this one audience. She keeps hugging Flora, hoping to send the girl her thoughts through her embrace.																						
139	139		301									Suddenly, Flora looks up and sulks, speaking in a purposefully accusatory tone.																						
140	140		201							1	500433																							
141	141		301							1	Flora	Hold on—hold on! I have to correct you on something, Miss. My dad wouldn't have cried before he died!	1																					
142	142		301								Flora	"Imagination and the freedom it offers, I hope it takes you beyond the ferryman's river."	1																					
143	143		301								Flora	"Elysium-bound you will be, in the future days when you are free."	1																					
144	144		301								Flora	That's Dad's favorite line... I'm sure he would have left behind this blessing as his last words... I'm sure of it!	1																					
145	145		202							1					1																			
146	146		201							1	500428																							
147	147		301							1	Pieter	...	1																					
148	148		301								Pieter	This line...	1																					
149	149		301									Pieter takes out his terminal.																						
150	150		301									In the message he received, there is a string of jumbled code after the coordinates. Jumbled, however, does not mean unsolvable. Recovering data is a skill every soldier knows.																						
151	151		301									But Pieter did not do it.																						
152	152		301									When he saw those words, that gaze of death seemed to haunt him once again.																						
153	153		301									He refused to look it in the eye.																						
154	154		301									But now, he operates on his terminal, untangling and revealing those jumbled words once more.																						
155	155		301									—"Imagination and the freedom it offers, I hope it takes you beyond the ferryman's river."																						
156	156		301									—"Elysium-bound you will be, in the future days when you are free."																						
157	157		204							1	14																							
158	158		301								Pieter	How could this be...	1																					
159	159		301								Pieter	So... a backbone before you died, huh...?	1																					
160	160		301								Pieter	Did my words really... move you that much...	1																					
161	161		202							1					1																			
162	162		301									The rookie who joined the army because of a momentary urge never forgot about the sentiments that drove him even in the face of death. In pain, he chose to pass this aspiration to his comrade.																						
163	163		301									But the rookie did not know that his comrade was the one who seeded this aspiration in his opera in the first place.																						
164	164		301									And now, years later—across time—it has returned to the hands of its author.																						
165	165		301									Putting down his terminal, Pieter lets out a few gravelly chuckles.																						
166	166		301									He looks up at the hugging girls on the stage.																						
167	167		301									He sees two flowers blossoming.																						
168	168		301									Art is their name, the soul their soil. Two flowers have sprouted after being moved.																						
169	169		301									That feeling was passed down from that great composer. Through his hands, it has spread throughout time.																						
170	170		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Not everything is perfect, nor is the journey smooth sailing, but that flower is growing from his legacy. Now, it blooms on the battlefield, the sky city, and the crumbling stage before him, speaking the same line he said in haste in the past.																						
171	171		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Pieter	Ha... how nice.

176	176		301								Pieter	That's the end of "A Hero's Farewell". Thank you for watching.																						
177	177		301									—What a great story, papa! Can I be someone like you when I grow up?																						
178	178		301									—Opera composer? I... don't really get it, but if a composer will tell good stories like you do, then I'll go do that!																						
179	179		301									—I also have a lot of songs I want to sing and a lot of stories I want to tell! I hope my stories will also make people jump up and down like I would!																						
180	180		301									—Are you leaving already, papa?																						
181	181		301									—Then tell me the rest of the story after you come back! Promise me!

186	186		301									When Pieter snaps awake, he finds his hands are clapping.																						
187	187		301									He has forgotten this feeling for a very long time. All he can do now is cheer.																						
188	188		301									Hearing him clapping, the two girls on the stage finally notice their audience, and they stand up, slightly embarrassed.																						
189	189		201							1	500430																							
190	190		301							1	Selena	By the way, I still don't know your name.	1
