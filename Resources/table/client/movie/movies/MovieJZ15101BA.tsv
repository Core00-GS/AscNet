10	10		301									They are both wielding greatswords and using similar maneuvers, but it is obvious that the older one is way more experienced.

19	19		301									The youth is named Camu, a civilian who is a little bit more capable than the average person. The mentor is named Mao Zhen, a Special Security personnel in Kurono.																						
20	20		301								Camu	Tch, what a headache!	1																					
21	21		401							2	10006001																							
22	22		301			RImgBg1Shake						Camu tosses his greatsword towards Mao Zhen and gets into his usual stance, hoping to grab his mentor and give him a good thrashing.																						
23	23		301								Mao Zhen	Also, haven't I told you not to talk in battle? You could get distracted.	2																					
24	24		301									Mao Zhen simply responds to Camu's rage by knocking the latter's weapon to the side with his own greatsword and bending down slightly.

32	32		301									The hilt of the sword is pressed against Camu's stomach. He curls up in anguish and take a few steps back.

40	40		301								Camu	Hey, at least help me up, yeah?	2																					
41	41		301								Mao Zhen	My apprentices do not rely on others' help.	1																					
42	42		301								Camu	Eh... fine.	2																					
43	43		301									Camu bounces up from the ground and dusts himself off.																						
44	44		301								Camu	I'm not sure how long exactly I've been training here... Why bring it up now, though? You want me to work for Kurono's Special Security Department too?	2																					
45	45		301								Mao Zhen	The Special Security Department is not for everyone, but I do believe Kurono is your best choice right now.	1																					
46	46		301								Camu	For real? I can really work for Kurono?	2																					
47	47		301								Mao Zhen	There's an increasing number of Corrupted, and fewer and fewer livable areas. The people at Kurono believe it's time to strengthen their security.	1																					
48	48		301								Camu	Security? You mean a private military.	2																					
49	49		301								Mao Zhen	Call it whatever you like. So? Will you starve to death on this block or become a Kurono soldier?	1																					
50	50		301								Camu	Did you really have to ask? I'll become a Kurono soldier, of course. And someday I'll climb higher than you.	2																					
51	51		301								Mao Zhen	You sure have no shame. But if—Nah, no way that's happening.	1																					
52	52		301								Camu	Are you calling me weak now, Master?	2																					
53	53		301								Mao Zhen	Who knows? Anyway, I'll be leaving the city for a mission soon. You should report in at Kurono tomorrow. If we're both unlucky, we might meet again.	1

58	58		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						—																						
59	59		301									Camu reports in at the Kurono headquarters the next morning. Several other youths from a similar background are also there.																						
60	60		201							1	500137																							
61	61		301							1	Instructor	Thank you all for coming today. Some of you we've recruited, some of you recommended by our own.	1																					
62	62		301								Instructor	You may come from different backgrounds, but we do not discriminate. Here, everyone's treated the same.	1																					
63	63		301									A tremor runs down Camu's spine. He notices several others in white lab coats stepping into the room behind the instructor.																						
64	64		301									Some are wheeling in basic monitoring devices, some carrying surgery tools, and some holding metal suitcases embossed with the Kurono logo.																						
65	65		301									Though the sight is unfamiliar, the youths present can all tell that the suitcase must hold what they call "serums."																						
66	66		301									It's the elixir that allows one to walk outside of a filtered city without being infected by the Punishing Virus.																						
67	67		301								Instructor	Want to become a Kurono soldier? Simple. We'll inject the serum into you, and you'll be under observation in our building for one night.	1																					
68	68		301								Civilian A	That's all? No need to go through tests or anything?																						
69	69		301								Instructor	Our devices have already determined your physical capabilities when you passed through our gate. Those who didn't make the cut were already sent away.	1																					
70	70		301									The instructor's indifferent comment seems to have given all the youths present a confidence boost, as if they were all "chosen ones".																						
71	71		301									Something, however, hangs on Camu's mind.																						
72	72		202							1																								
73	73		201							1	500189																							
74	74		301							1	Camu	Why do we have to be observed for a whole night? Doesn't the serum just make us immune to the Punishing Virus?	1																					
75	75		301									If they are testing the effects of the serum, should they not be let outside instead?																						
76	76		203							1	0.25	400																						
77	77		201							2	500137		-400																					
78	78		301							1	Instructor	Because it's a specially-modified serum. We don't know how many of you it will work on. This is a safety precaution.	2																					
79	79		202							1	2																							
80	80		301									While beset with questions, Camu decides to keep them to himself. Like the others, he figures that this will not be such a big deal.																						
81	81		301									As long as he becomes a Kurono soldier, he will be set for his whole life—unless he dies in battle, of course.																						
82	82		301									That is why so many others have gathered here.																						
83	83		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					After the brief Q&A session, the instructor moves discreetly out of the room. The prospective soldiers get their serums injected and are sent into the pre-arranged containment rooms to be observed.																						
84	84		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
85	85		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The enclosed spaces are completely bare and unlit. In the darkness, Camu notices a security camera above his head.																						
86	86		201			RImgBg1Shake				1	500189																							
87	87		301								Camu	So they'll be watching us all night, huh... What time is it anyway?	1																					
88	88		301									Camu had expected a long, boring period of waiting, but a strange sensation soon comes over the serum-injected spot.

92	92		301									It is as if his muscles and veins are expanding from the inside. The pressure against his nerves gives him so much pain that he topples to the ground the very next second.																						
93	93		301									As if on cue, shouts and wall-banging travel over from the other rooms.																						
94	94		401							2	1512																							
95	95		301								Civilian A	Let me out!																						
96	96		301								Civilian B	Agh! Arrgh!																						
97	97		301								Civilian C	What's going on? Am I allergic? Doctor! Is there a doctor?																						
98	98		301									Only a few were shouting at first, but after a while, it feels like everyone else out there is screaming for help.																						
99	99		301									But there is no response. Writhing in pain, all Camu can hear is the clicking of the security camera as it zooms in and out. He tries his best to calm himself down by focusing on the regular, mechanical whines.																						
100	100		301								Camu	Ugh... darn it, Master... What's going on?																						
101	101		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The effects finally overtake his senses. After wheezing for a short while, he faints.																						
102	102		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png																								
103	103		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						—																						
104	104		301									An indefinite number of hours later, Camu is awakened by a blinding light and forceful shaking.																						
105	105		301								Monitoring Personnel A	Camu, status: alive and healthy.																						
106	106		301								Monitoring Personnel B	So this is the last one of the survivors, huh? There sure aren't a lot of them.																						
107	107		301									Camu has no idea who the people talking in front of him are, nor what is going on.																						
108	108		301									But before he falls unconscious once more, he hears a certain word.																						
109	109		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Monitoring Personnel A	Pass.
