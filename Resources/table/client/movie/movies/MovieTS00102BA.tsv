9	9		301								Lee	You've been sending a message every 20 seconds. If something's wrong, you'll be the first to know.	2																					
10	10		301								Lucia	I... I'm just worried.	1																					
11	11		301								Lee	Asimov's research suggests that occasional distractions can increase your mission efficiency by 15%.	2																					
12	12		301								Lucia	Distraction? I want to be more focused!	1																					
13	13		301								Lee	The building at our 3 o'clock... Its design belongs to a different era of industrial design than the other buildings. I've analyzed the plans of the Golden Vortex, and they have quite a few similarities.	2																					
14	14		301								Lucia	Understood. And the ejector of its light beam consists of a blinds structure that I'd seen when I was stationed at the Jakarta base.	1																					
15	15		301								Lee	That light beam is actually a stream of endless golden sand. I've calculated the wattage the Golden Vortex is using to eject that amount of sand with my visual capture system.	2																					
16	16		301								Lucia	(Looks at the calculation) ...That high?!	1																					
17	17		301								Lee	I believe the data. Plus, the sand at the center of that stream can't even be captured by the visual system... I believe the actual value will be even higher.	2																					
18	18		301								Lucia	Who built it? What is it for?	1																					
19	19		301								Lucia	Commandant, I'm afraid that this mission is not that straightforward...	1
