3	3		301			DialogEnable						Soon, all the remains of the Hetero-Creatures are completely devoured by the monster in the container without leaving a trace of the Punishing Virus behind.

5	5		301							1	Roland	That was thorough...	1																					
6	6		301									Roland juggles the container in his hand. The flesh inside does not look any different, even after devouring all the Hetero-Creatures.

8	8		301								Roland	Haha... Were they not enough for you?	1																					
9	9		301									The remaining Hetero-Creatures have stopped pursuing, their flight capabilities seemingly reaching their limits... but their behavior suggests that they are actually afraid of the more capable "monster" in Roland's hand.																						
10	10		301								Roland	Not only do they look like living organisms, but they're also even prioritizing survival, aren't they?	1																					
11	11		301									It is a creature's instinct to fear death and aim to survive. But the more humanity's rationality develops, the more humans can control their primal instincts.

13	13		301								Roland	That is why everyone's looking for a reason to live...	1																					
14	14		301									He once believed that life and death are just that. If there can be no definite answers, simply dying is enough to be a beautiful curtain call for him.																						
15	15		301									The ship begins to accelerate after disposing of the Hetero-Creatures. Roland looks up at the Moon in the distance.																						
16	16		301									—Will my answer be there?																						
17	17		301									Staying with the girl with white hair is his reason to live, or so he has presumptuously decided... As long as she chooses to keep going, he will do anything to help her without a second thought.																						
18	18		301								Roland	But if even she, as an agent, has lost her reasons to live...	1																					
19	19		301									"Is Luna worth saving?" That is the question Vonnegut has left him.																						
20	20		301									Roland takes out what Alpha gave him—a storage device as thin and light as a chip. It will crumple into dust with the gentlest force.																						
21	21		301									He had a brother too, but that yearning was man-made; not even his wits could tell if his feelings were genuine... Up until the last moment, he could not forget this "character" that only existed in the script.																						
22	22		301									Roland retracts his self-deprecating smile, sitting right there on the bow. In his left hand is the storage device from Alpha; in his right hand is the container with the stem cell from Vonnegut...																						
23	23		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	But no matter what we do, we are just side characters... Luna, only you can save yourself. Will it be death... or will it be life?	1
