8	8		301									Nanami's goal is unrealistic, but if... on the off chance that Nanami succeeds... That would be pretty nice for everyone.																						
9	9		301									Which is why Martin, struck with the terrible freedom of nothing-to-do-ness, decided to guide Nanami's path in this snowy land toward possible bionic congregations.

11	11		301							1	Bionic Machine	ROAR!	1

13	13		301							1	Nanami	Oh, look! It's a mecha-ted just like you, Marton!	1																					
14	14		201							1	500211																							
15	15		301							1	Martin	Well, yeah. We're all just bear models.	1																					
16	16		202							1																								
17	17		301									Under Martin's guidance, Nanami reaches the outer rim of a settlement.																						
18	18		301									Once a human settlement, the place is now a bionic nest. Piles upon piles of differently sized energy tanks clog up the loading dock. The bionic mechanoids seem to be trying to transport the tanks somewhere.																						
19	19		201							1	500091	1																						
20	20		301							1	Nanami	Woah, talk about bionic diversity! Is this place supposed to be a zoo or something?	1																					
21	21		201							1	500211																							
22	22		301							1	Martin	Nah. Bionics are useful for war, or so they say. We're all military-grade bionics.	1																					
23	23		201							1	500091																							
24	24		301							1	Nanami	So that's why you got all those spooky weaponry on you, Martini.	1																					
25	25		201							1	500211																							
26	26		301							1	Martin	...Well. I think your chainsaw is way spookier than what I've got.	1																					
27	27		201							1	500091	1																						
28	28		301							1	Nanami	Ehehe, I'll blush if you keep praising Nanami like that!	1																					
29	29		201							1	500211																							
30	30		301							1	Martin	Wasn't trying to!	1																					
31	32		301									The two survey the settlement for a while. Martin directs his gaze toward several bionics that were acting as overseers.																						
32	33		301								Martin	So, what next, Nanami? If you wanna have a talk with them, I can bring you over and...	1

37	37		301							1	Martin	Wha...?!	1																					
38	38		202							1																								
39	39		301			RImgBg1Shake						Before Martin could even turn and phrase his question at Nanami, she has already leaped out of their cover. Springing into action with both wheels beneath her feet, she hurtles toward the settlement.

41	41		301							1	Nanami	Take this! A jump to the sky turns into a Nanami kick!	1

46	46		301									Before anyone could react, the Nanami kick has already landed squarely on a pitch black machine hiding in the shadows.																						
47	47		301									The bionics all pause, gazing dumbfoundedly at the sight of the girl and the charred remains beneath her.																						
48	48		201							1	500208																							
49	49		301							1	Bionic Machine	Wha... What's that black thing...?	1
