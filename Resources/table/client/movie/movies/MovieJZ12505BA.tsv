3	3		304							Dear Selena, I've got good news!	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
4	4		304							The play I've been writing has an important breakthrough.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
5	5		304							It happened... because I've obtained more information about you.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
6	6		304							Records from the abandoned space station.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
7	7		304							Chairman Allen had a long struggle with the Parliament in order to conduct an investigation and data collection on the space station.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
8	8		304							I've never seen him looking this serious...	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
9	9		304							The squad that eventually landed there retrieved the remains of the lost Archaeological Team.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
10	10		304							One of their memory banks miraculously preserved an audio file.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
11	11		304							It was your voice in that file.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
12	12		304							I heard... the chat you two had, and your song.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
13	13		304							...	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
14	14		304							Truth is, it took me a while to collect myself before writing this letter.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
15	15		304							I'm sorry, but I can't recall how I felt when I first heard it as I'm writing this.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
16	16		304							I felt... hurt, and helpless, and... angry. I can see them on Chairman Allen's face as well, who allowed me to listen to the clip.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1		1																	
17	17		304							For a moment, I almost felt like you were there with me.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
18	18		304							Sure... That was pleasant and naive. But perhaps that sweetness was what allowed me to write this story down.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
19	19		304							Later in the audio clip, there was only one voice.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
20	20		304							Your voice... you were talking to yourself.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
21	21		304							You told me that talking to oneself is an inevitable step in creation. Truth be told, that, too, was how I felt since I started writing.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
22	22		304							It is a peculiar experience. I thought I knew myself quite well, but as I started penning my characters' actions, I began to realize—	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
23	23		304							There are so many parts of me that I have yet to explore. The ways I wanted the world to develop as I wrote them down.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
24	24		304							Do you... also talk to yourself when you write?	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
25	25		304							Have you ever been convinced, accused, or saved by your inner self?	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
26	26		304							In the three years you slumbered in the space station... how many times... have you talked to yourself...	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
27	27		304							Tell me, Selena.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1

32	32		301								Flora	～An impressive battle it was, my brave comrades! But the fight is yet over, for our land is corrupted still, I'm afraid.～	1																					
33	33		301								Flora	～So stand! Stand! Behind you your homeland you shall guard and defend!～	1

36	36		301							1	Selena	...																						
37	37		202							1					1																			
38	38		301									The girl before them sings relentlessly, showered in the orange-tinted light.																						
39	39		301									She looks so lively with the dusk focused on her like a spotlight, highlighting the only protagonist on this stage.																						
40	40		301									Only when Selena approaches closer that she realizes the girl's frail body is slightly shaking. Flora's arms show small signs of infection, which must be excruciating for a child. She is relying on her willpower to perform for an empty audience.																						
41	41		301									This is an underground theater. The subterranean design has slowed down its deterioration, and the hidden entrance has shielded it from Corrupted attacks. Even the stage is intact.																						
42	42		301									It also makes it difficult for those who search for it. Pieter followed the track to this place, only to be circling it outside, unable to pin down Flora's trail.																						
43	43		301									By the time Selena discovered the underground structure and found the entrance by analyzing the architecture in the surroundings, it was already dusk.																						
44	44		301									Then she argued with Pieter for a while at the entrance.																						
45	45		301									—"If we take her back by force, she's just going to run away again in the future... Just give me a little time. A little is all I ask. Let me talk to her."																						
46	46		301									She convinced Pieter to stay at the entrance, entering the theater by herself.																						
47	47		301									And she has been watching the first half of the girl's solo performance as the sole audience.																						
48	48		301									As the girl finishes a segment, Selena steps forward.																						
49	49		201							1	500430	4																						
50	50		301							1	Selena	～Oh, blood and blades. One by one you've sent my friends away.～	1																					
51	51		301									Selena steps onto the stage, speaking the familiar lines. The very words that her younger self wrote.																						
52	52		301								Selena	～My dearest brother, a brave solder, scars-covered. Before my eyes he fell, the battlefield his blood colored.～	1																					
53	53		301									Noticing an unexpected audience and co-performer, Flora looks ecstatic.																						
54	54		201							1	500433	1																						
55	55		301							1	Flora	～Beside him, a noble officer, wounded and similar-fated, crawling to the one first erased. Above the blood-soaked man he lies, arms held, his lips pressing the scorched face.～	1																					
56	56		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Flora tries her best to control her excitement and stay in character, taking a step toward Selena.
