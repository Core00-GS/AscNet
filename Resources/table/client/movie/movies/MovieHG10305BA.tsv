5	5		302								That's right.	6	We can just terminate it as well.	10

8	8		301							1	Lee	But it surely is difficult to track something without its waveform signatures.	2

12	12		301							1	Lucia	In that case... we might want to call in reinforcement during battle, depending on how powerful it is.	1																					
13	13		301								Lucia	Liv, can you try to send out a reinforcement request in the area?	1

23	23		201							1	1011001																							
24	24		301							1	Lee	Of course we were. You've been acting like this since we left the base. Is something wrong with your frame?	1																					
25	25		201							1	500021																							
26	26		301							1	Liv	No, nothing's wrong. My frame is functioning properly.	1																					
27	27		302								How about you go back to the base first?	28	Are you sure?	29																				
28	28	30	301								Liv	I can still carry out the mission, so...	1

33	33		301							1	Lee	I knew it.	1																					
34	34		301								Lee	Liv's M.I.N.D. is in disarray. Data caching is exceeding the threshold!	1																					
35	35		302								Data caching?	36	We'll prioritize Liv first.	37																				
36	36	40	301								Lee	Although we don't have to rest, our M.I.N.D.s still need to process excessive data regularly.	1																					
37	37		201							1	1021001																							
38	38		301							1	Lucia	Understood.	1																					
39	39		201							1	1011001																							
40	40		301							1	Lee	A small amount of cache is fine, but in excess, it could throw the M.I.N.D. into disarray... Like fevers to humans.	1																					
41	41		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lee	Anyway, let's bring her back to the base for now.	1
