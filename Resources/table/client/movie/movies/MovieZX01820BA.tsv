248	244		301			RImgBg1Shake						Kamui raises his greatsword and slashes downward from high above as "Gear" retreats. The devastating slash strikes the ground, sending debris flying into the air.																						
249	245		301									"Gear" shoulders the blow of debris, then reaches out to grab Kamui through the cloud of dust,																						
250	246		301									But as "Gear" traverses the dust, it is met with a scythe imbued with lightning.

267	263		301									After pushing off the stone slab that pinned it down, "Gear" slowly exits the building. A faint current envelopes it. The slash from the greatsword should have smashed its frame. Instead, it only leaves a faint scratch on its helmet.
