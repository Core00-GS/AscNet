127	127		301								Palma	What? Lee? He asked you to meet the Forsaken?	1

166	166		301								Palma	...	2																					
167	167		301								Grace	Besides, we have his promise. If this battle is a success, we can have our new future.	1

250	250		301			DialogEnable						After the most fierce wave of Hetero-Creature attack, the coastline defense is once again in a stalemate. The only difference is that each move of Hetero-Creature is slowly but surely eroding the human's battle line.																						
251	251		301									Thanks to the support of the Purifying Force, the Omega Weapon defense on the west side can be barely maintained. But the east side, with relatively weaker strength, is on the brink of total collapse.																						
252	252		301									The battle was meant to be a small defensive operation, but before anyone realized, it has turned into a large-scale trench warfare. The beach is totally exposed and lacks cover. Soldiers can only rely on the Omega Weapons in front to shield themselves.																						
253	253		301									But when the supplies cannot keep up with the consumption, all the effort will end up in vain...
