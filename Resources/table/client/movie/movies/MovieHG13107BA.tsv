3	3		301			DialogEnable						The time to return has arrived.																						
4	4		301									The transport craft from Babylonia has brought the Expedition Team their scheduled supplies. Meanwhile, Bianca, you, and a few members whose frames require urgent repairs will return to Babylonia with the aircraft.																						
5	5		301									The Expedition Team even planned to host a small farewell party for the two of you. Bianca shut down the idea as soon as she heard it, obviously.																						
6	6		301									While the members of the Expedition Team bid you farewell tearfully, Bianca quietly leaves to help move the supplies, perhaps motivated by the same feeling.

10	10		301								Expedition Member B	We'll miss you... I still want to listen to more adventures of yours in the Task Force...	2																					
11	11		301									Several members who have interacted with you come up and give you a big hug. Their warmth and kindness have not cooled down despite the years they have stayed in Antarctica.

14	14		301							1	Expedition Captain	Stop crying, you lot.	1																					
15	15		301								Expedition Captain	Although it was brief, we've had a good time with you, 【kuroname】. You and Bianca have helped us tremendously.	1																					
16	16		301								Expedition Captain	I hope we'll see you again after you defeat the Punishing Virus!	1																					
17	17		302								You guys take care too.	18	We'll not let you down.	18																				
18	18		301									You have heard that the Expedition Captain was once a renowned human scientist too. He only became a Construct to be able to stay in Antarctica for an extended period of time.																						
19	19		301									Your respect for the Expedition Team has only grown after your days with them.																						
20	20		301									They may not be the active soldiers on the frontline or the researchers from the Science Council designing weapons against the Punishing Virus day and night...																						
21	21		301									But they are also working tirelessly for the future you are all fighting for.																						
22	22		301								Expedition Captain	By the way, the photos you've taken need to be uploaded to the database of this research station.	1																					
23	23		301								Expedition Captain	But you're free to make a copy if you want.	1																					
24	24		301								Expedition Captain	Take care, Gray Raven Commandant!	1																					
25	25		301									With that, the quiet and collected captain also pulls you in for a hug.

27	27		301									After saying goodbye to the Constructs of the Expedition Team, you take your camera to a small terminal inside the station, ready to upload the photos.																						
28	28		301									Looking at the photos scrolling past the monitor one by one, you begin to connect the different memories into a complete narrative.																						
29	29		301									...Until you scroll to the photo you showed Bianca.																						
30	30		302								...	31																						
31	31		301									You took the photo after applying for an additional expedition and tracked down the migrating penguins alone.																						
32	32		301									You did not understand what your obsession with them was even when you pressed the shutter and immortalized the scene.																						
33	33		301									That reason was something you could not figure out on your own.																						
34	34		301									Not to mention that you would never know if the lone penguin Bianca and you saw that day did end up back with her flock—even your photo could not guarantee it.																						
35	35		301									Your interpretation might not actually be what happened.																						
36	36		301									Perhaps that was a scouting penguin returning to inform her companions of a safe route.																						
37	37		301									Perhaps that was a penguin who walked too fast, and now she was trying to slow down and rejoin her flock.																						
38	38		301									Perhaps that lone penguin was a stranger, barging into a group she did not belong.																						
39	39		301									Bianca probably also noticed it, except she did not expose your shaky argument.																						
40	40		301									But so what?																						
41	41		301									Interpreting animal behaviors through a human lens is just wishful thinking.																						
42	42		301									What you wish it represented reveals your own perspectives and concerns.																						
43	43		301									What really matters is if you will act according to your answer, whatever it takes.																						
44	44		201							1	500533																							
45	45		301							1	Bianca	Still not done, Commandant?	1																					
46	46		301									Bianca pushes open the door and enters right then.																						
47	47		204							1	1																							
48	48		301								Bianca	Doublechecking the photos, are you? Let me help. The transport craft is waiting for us.	1																					
49	49		302								It's alright. I'm done.	50																						
50	50		302								Let's go.	51																						
51	51		302								We're going home.	52																						
52	52		204							1	4																							
53	53		301								Bianca	Of course.	1																					
54	54		204							1	1																							
55	55		301									Smiling, she salutes you before spinning around smoothly, leading the way out.

57	57		301									Unplugging the cable, you place the small memory drive inside the pocket on your chest.																						
58	58		301									Then you place the camera on the desk, leaving it behind for the Expedition Team.																						
59	59		301									Standing tall, you hurry and chase after Bianca.																						
60	60		301									It is as if the figure ahead of you can sense what you are thinking...																						
61	61		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					And she slows down.
