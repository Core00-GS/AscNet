3	3		301				RImgBg1Disable					Dusk on the Nighter begins with the extended sound of a trumpet, signaling the commencement of the night bazaar.

5	6		301			RImgBg1Enable	RImgBg1Disable					Noises converge on the deck where the neon signs wake, while lanterns shaped as dragon heads take flight, encircling the central tower. The dazzling view of the Nighter by night rises on the dark horizon.																						
6	8		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory158.png																								
7	9		301			RImgBg1Enable						The stage before the tower becomes the center of the Nighter during the bazaar, where merchants come to bid in the famed Trade Fair. Folks gather for the displays, as do the rich and powerful in their loges.																						
8	10		301									Kemuri's troupe of mechanoid puppets takes the stage in a showcase of graceful sword dances. Their braids glide as phoenixes, their bodies sway as willows—mechanical yet spirited, gentle yet cold.																						
9	200		301									Their performance has also lined the crowd with dread, however. The audience is well aware that the elegant dancers onstage are always an order away from drawing blood with their swords.																						
10	11		301									And then fireworks soar above the deck, exploding into spectacular colors between the towers and the lanterns.																						
11	12		301				RImgBg1Disable					Earth or heaven, this is as opulent as it gets.																						
12	14		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory155.png																								
13	15		301			RImgBg1Enable						Beyond the Trade Fair, the night bazaar is equally bustling.																						
14	16		301									A man who just exited the loge is currently arguing with a merchant.																						
15	17		201							1	500228																							
16	18		301							1	Tycoon	Is this trash what you're selling me?	1																					
17	19		301									A bona fide mogul, the man dressed in riches holds a smoking pipe in gold in his hand, his shirt pinned with an equally golden pocket watch. He scolds the merchant in front of him with utter disdain.																						
18	20		301								Merchant	S-sorry, sir... This is all that's left. But maybe if you visit again tomorrow—																						
19	21		301									Wiping off the sweat from his brows, the merchant bends over backward to apologize to the tycoon, his head dipping as low as the rich man's boots.																						
20	22		301									Meanwhile, the surrounding hawkers flock to the wealthy man, hungry and craving.																						
21	23		301								Gathered Hawkers	Check out my offers, sir! Brand new livers, freshly picked—																						
22	24		301								Gathered Hawkers	Screw you! I'm here first, sir! Look—healthy organs in mint condition!																						
23	25		301								Gathered Hawkers	How about some prosthetics, sir? I've just restocked—																						
24	26		301									The hawkers are relentless, wrestling for a shot to sell their wares in exchange for miles, even if it means stepping over a fellow merchant.																						
25	27		201							1	500235																							
26	28		301							1		Distracted by the commotion, nobody notices a boy sneakily approaching the tycoon from behind.																						
27	29		301									The boy keeps looking over his shoulder indecisively, his face filled with hesitation.																						
28	30		301									Changyu will later recall this moment when he first notices the boy while hanging in a food stall to the side.																						
29	31		301									The boy's expression is all too familiar to him.																						
30	32		201							1	500227	4																						
31	33		301							1	Boy	...	1																					
32	34		301									Having made up his mind, the boy takes advantage of the confusion to reach for the tycoon's pocket, where a purse is poking out.																						
33	35		202							1					1																			
34	36		301									Seeing this, Changyu leaps from his seat, shoving his half-empty sour plum drink to the stall's owner.																						
35	37		201							1	500216	1																						
36	38		301							1	Changyu	Hold this for me, Uncle Fu!	1																					
37	39		301								Uncle Fu	Hey, punk, pay up—																						
38	40		301								Changyu	Back in a sec! Put it on my tab!	1																					
39	41		301									Changyu dexterously dashes between the customers, hopping over the bench outside the stall.																						
40	42		301								Changyu	Move! Move!	1

45	46		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Changyu	Hey, boss! Forgetting anything?																						
46	47		301									The boy is stepping away when Changyu walks by and blows the whistle on him. While whistling.																						
47	48		301									Slightly confused at first, the wealthy tycoon pats his pockets at once—																						
48	49		301									—And finds nothing inside. The tycoon's plump face stiffens and tenses, and he immediately grabs the now panicking boy.																						
49	50		301								Tycoon	My purse! You rascal!																						
50	51		301								Boy	I-I don't—																						
51	52		301									Facing away from them, Changyu masterfully swoops up the purse from the boy's jacket.																						
52	53		301								Tycoon	Give it back now!																						
53	54		301								Boy	I don't have it!																						
54	55		301								Tycoon	You're dead meat if I find it!																						
55	56		301								Changyu	Is this what you're looking for?																						
56	57		301								Boy	W-what? When did you—																						
57	58		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Despite feeling confident that he has stowed it securely inside his jacket, the boy looks in shock as Changyu flaps the gemstone-clad purse in front of the two of them, giving the tycoon an upward nod.

62	64		301							1	Boy	I...	1																					
63	65		301									The boy attempts to bolt, not realizing Changyu has him firmly in his grasp.																						
64	66		301									The tycoon raises his arm above his head, ready to smack the boy—only to have his purse shoved into his lifted hand by Changyu, and any momentum of a strike is lost.

68	69		301								Changyu	The night bazaar is brimming with colorful folks, my good sir. Remember to keep your hands in your pockets next time, 'cause I can't guarantee others will keep their hands in theirs, okay?	2																					
69	62626		502							PanelActor1Shake																								
70	70		301									Changyu says so with a smile. Despite Changyu's frail appearance, the boy is surprised by his strength when he fails to flee from his hold.

75	74		301							1	Changyu	Just a concerned Kowloong citizen—and, please, you don't have to thank me! I'll leave you be. Enjoy your time here in the bazaar!	1

81	81		301									The boy is so mad his eyes seem to be popping out.																						
82	82		301								Changyu	Amateur.	1																					
83	83		204							2	4																							
84	84		301								Boy	...What?	2																					
85	85		301								Changyu	I said, what an amateur!	1																					
86	86		301								Changyu	Did you see the look on the tycoon's face? If this is all you've got for this line of work, you're gonna get caught. And people like them don't take kindly to it.	1																					
87	87		301								Changyu	Why were you stealing the purse in the first place?	1																					
88	88		204							2	5																							
89	89		301								Boy	N-none of your damn business! If you're just thief-splaining...	2

91	91		204							2	4																							
92	92		301								Boy	...Huh?	2																					
93	400		401							1	205																							
94	93		301									Changyu takes out an intricately crafted coin, tossing it into the air before catching it.																						
95	999		204							1	1																							
96	94		301								Changyu	How much do you think you can take from a purse? What is this, the Golden Age? No one brings cash anymore! But that man dressed like big money, which means he would be carrying a token like this.	1																					
97	95		301								Changyu	This token is where the money's at—identification of a member of the Chamber of Commerce. And the doors you can open with this...	1																					
98	96		204							1	1																							
99	97		301								Changyu	See, here's your first lesson. See better.	1																					
100	98		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Changyu grins like he is on top of the world, and with his arm around the boy's shoulder, he leads the stupefied young man away.

108	106		301								Changyu	C'mon, Uncle Fu, I told you to put it on my tab—and here I am with a new customer!	1

110	108		301								Changyu	See, I know you are the best!	1

115	113		301								Changyu	Didn't I mess up your job earlier? So take this as my apology, and now we're even!	1																					
116	114		301								Changyu	And I have to thank you as well—the way he hid his token, you really did me a solid back there, running distractions.	1																					
117	115		204							2	4																							
118	116		301								Boy	...	2																					
119	117		301								Boy	You're—	2

125	122		301									Changyu prepares the noodles with a well-practiced routine, pouring the Shacha sauce into the bowl and stirring it before placing it in front of the boy.																						
126	123		301								Boy	...	2																					
127	124		301									The boy is determined to turn down Changyu's offering, but in the face of a hot bowl of noodle soup, he cannot help but take a large bite.																						
128	125		301								Changyu	How is it?	1																					
129	126		301								Boy	It's... delicious!	2																					
130	127		301								Changyu	Told ya!	1

132	129		301								Changyu	I'm Changyu. You?	1																					
133	130		301								Boy	...Do you just tell everyone your name?	2																					
134	131		301								Changyu	Exchanging names is common courtesy in Kowloong. You do it after the apology and the noodles.	1																					
135	132		301								Boy	Huainan.	2																					
136	133		301								Changyu	Hmm. You aren't exactly dressing in rags... Ran into trouble, didn't you? Want to talk about it?	1

139	136		301								Changyu	True. Who isn't in trouble on the Nighter, am I right?	1																					
140	137		301								Changyu	I'll leave you to your noodles, then. Just remember to be more careful next time—and stay away from the stingy type with a temper.	1																					
141	138		301								Changyu	It was a good call making a move when you did. An amateur like you won't stand a chance when Pulao's mechanoids arrive at the bazaar later tonight.	1																					
142	139		301								Huainan	I-I know that!	2																					
143	140		204							1	1

149	146		301								Huainan	...Changyu, is it?	2																					
150	147		301									The boy named Huainan watches as Changyu departs, buried in thought. It takes him a moment before he returns to his bowl of Shacha noodles.																						
151	148		301									When he finishes, Huainan shoves the empty bowl aside and gets up, ready to leave.																						
152	149		301								Uncle Fu	You—stop it right there!																						
153	150		301								Huainan	...Who? Me?	2																					
154	151		301								Uncle Fu	Obviously! You stay right there!																						
155	152		301								Huainan	What's wrong?	2																					
156	153		301								Uncle Fu	That punk said you're paying his tab. That's one Shacha noodles and one sour plum drink. You paying with grubs or what?																						
157	154		301								Huainan	...	2																					
158	155		301									Huainan turns to where Changyu was headed, and finds him turning around at the same time. Changyu waves and cups his hand around his mouth, and from a distance he yells—																						
159	156		301								Changyu	Your second lesson—don't be so trusting!
