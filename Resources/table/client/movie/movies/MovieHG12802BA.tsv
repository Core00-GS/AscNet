4	4		301									A hole punctures the clouds at the edge of the dull, gray sky, allowing the soft glow of the sun to go through and cast a light on a towering building.

7	7		301							1		The wind blows past the buildings, gently bashing against the lady's clothes.																						
8	8		301									She stands in the gap of a broken railing at the edge of a balcony, where the birds of the city claim their domains.																						
9	9		301									Underneath an eye-catching, old-fashioned floppy hat is a pair of golden pupils staring into the distance.																						
10	10		301									In theory, she can stand there until the reinforcing bars decay and break as long as the parts that maintain her balance remain functional.																						
11	11		301									The slender figure built with an amalgamation of metal alloys is more powerful than the strongest body made with flesh and blood.																						
12	12		401							1	50																							
13	13		301									But why is she standing there?																						
14	14		301									However you view it, she still looks like a pigeon that is alone and helpless, lost in an intense debate of whether to fall.																						
15	15		301									Leaving her be does not seem like a good idea, but recalling your last encounter, you figure you should be more cautious in case she thinks you are hostile again.																						
16	16		301									You open your arms and position them visibly before you, approaching the lady carefully.																						
17	17		301									Then she sees you, her eyes clear as a peaceful pond like before.																						
18	18		401							1	36																							
19	19		301								Haicma	"Get some fresh air on the balcony and take in the scenery." I was simply following the instruction.	1																					
20	20		302								...	21	(I worried too much...) 	21																				
21	21		301								Haicma	Since some of the buildings are blocking the view, I've calculated that this is the best location to do so.	1																					
22	22		401							1	205																							
23	23		301								Haicma	Do you have any suggestions?	1																					
24	24		301									...																						
25	25		301									You think back. You are here on this balcony because you noticed the strayed Construct after you dodged a falling object.																						
26	26		301									And you almost became the first recorded commandant to be heavily wounded by a fallen railing.																						
27	27		302								(Express all your queries)	28																						
28	28		301								Haicma	...I was sent here to scout the area. Currently, I'm on my maintenance break.	1																					
29	29		301								Haicma	About the metal railing—	1																					
30	30		301								Haicma	It was occupying the best location to "get some fresh air on the balcony" according to my calculations, so I proceeded to remove it.	1																					
31	31		301									She says it casually as if all she has done was putting a book away as she holds down her hair gently to keep the wind from blowing it back.																						
32	32		302								There's something I want to know personally...	33																						
33	33		302								Why not a hilltop if you just want some fresh air?	34																						
34	34		301								Haicma	According to the diaries, getting fresh air on the balcony can relieve stress.	1																					
35	35		302								So the balcony is also a factor... And you're stressed?	36																						
36	36		301								Haicma	Stressed about the diaries.	1																					
37	37		301									She holds up a bundle of neatly strapped notebooks.																						
38	38		301								Haicma	This is the most I can collect in a day, and, presumably, they are still not enough.	1																					
39	39		302								What do you mean?	40																						
40	40		301								Haicma	Instead of these incomplete journals, I require more comprehensive records.	1																					
41	41		301									More comprehensive?																						
42	42		301								Haicma	A diary should contain everything its author does in one solar day.	1																					
43	43		301									Your spider-sense is tingling.																						
44	44		301								Haicma	For example... records on activities, records on thoughts, records on visuals, records on audio, records on smell...	1																					
45	45		302								Wait a sec...	46																						
46	46		301								Haicma	Records on touch, records on simulated emotions, records on frame status...	1																					
47	47		302								Hold on.	48																						
48	48		301								Haicma	Records on combat, records on weapon maintenance, records on injuries...	1																					
49	49		301									The girl before you is speaking non-stop at incredible speed. It is even wilder than that guy from Babylonia who fudges his report summary.																						
50	50		301									"Isn't it great that we don't have to breathe? How sick it is to say everything in one go?—A certain Construct"																						
51	51		301									But if you do not stop her right here, her M.I.N.D. will deviate.																						
52	52		302								Hold on!	53																						
53	53		301								Haicma	...	1																					
54	54		301								Haicma	Was there something wrong with the sequence? Or did I forget something?	1																					
55	55		302								You only need to journal the important things.	56																						
56	56		301								Haicma	Important things?	1																					
57	57		301								Haicma	I believe the data sets I mentioned are highly prioritized.	1																					
58	58		302								And above them?	59																						
59	59		301								Haicma	...Please clarify. What is more important than data about yourself?	1																					
60	60		302								Let's say there's something before you.	61																						
61	61		302								Something that can make you forget your data for a while.	62																						
62	62		302								That's what you put down in a diary.	63																						
63	63		204							1																								
64	64		301								Haicma	...	1																					
65	65		302								Look. You don't see health data in that diary, right?	66																						
66	66		301								Haicma	"October 21st. Took some meds today for my upset stomach..."	1																					
67	67		301								Haicma	Error report and maintenance report.	1																					
68	68		302								...	69																						
69	69		302								But were you drawn to that or the other content?	70																						
70	70		401							1	208																							
71	71		301									She falls silent.	1																					
72	72		301									It seems that she can still understand, albeit in a less straightforward way. If words are the problem...																						
73	73		302								What about painting?	74																						
74	74		204							1	7																							
75	75		301								Haicma	Painting?	1																					
76	76		302								Pictures are more direct than words.	77																						
77	77		302								Paint one picture every day about the most important thing you've seen that day.	78																						
78	78		301								Haicma	Just one?	1																					
79	79		204							1																								
80	80		301								Haicma	I see. To eliminate the chance that I record everything onto my paintings...	1																					
81	81		301								Haicma	The viability of this experiment is estimated to be high. Despite having recorded all visual data in my internal memory drive, I believe this external recording is the closest approximation to being human.	1																					
82	82		301									A 24-hour footage record? You cannot believe they have installed this function for the Constructs in conservation areas...																						
83	83		301									Still, she is not very guarded for a Construct that acts alone.																						
84	84		302								Aren't you worried that I might be tricking you?	85																						
85	85		301								Haicma	Given that your heart rate has not fluctuated, the possibility of you lying to me is low.	1																					
86	86		301								Haicma	And your suggestion is indeed viable. It doesn't matter if it was a lie.	1																					
87	87		302								You should still be more careful.	88																						
88	88		204							1	1																							
89	89		401							1	205																							
90	90		301								Haicma	That's not necessary. From the data I've collected, you pose no threat.	1																					
91	91		301									Looking her in the eyes, you immediately remember the day you met and how quickly she subdued you.																						
92	92		301									Maybe it is the light, but you seem to notice a slight change in her tranquil expression.																						
93	93		302								...	96	You're smiling, aren't you?	94																				
94	94		204							1																								
95	95		301								Haicma	Smiling... Are you recommending I smile right now?	1																					
96	96		204							1																								
97	97		401							1	208																							
98	98		301									...Never mind. Now is not the time to dwell on it.																						
99	99		301									You should return to your mission, now that you have confirmed her safety.																						
100	100		301									After all, the airdrops have begun. The conservation area nearby needs you to bring back enough supplies.																						
101	101		301								Haicma	Are you leaving?	1																					
102	102		302								Yeah. Let's save it for next time if there's something else.	103																						
103	103		301								Haicma	Next time? The chances of us meeting again have decreased from 1.4% to 0.12%. This possibility is negligible.	1																					
104	104		301								Haicma	If there's something else you want to say, I recommend you say it now.	1																					
105	105		301									Why does her description unnerve you...?																						
106	106		302								Can you tell me your name?	107																						
107	107		301								Haicma	Haicma.	1																					
108	108		301									Haicma... You repeat the name, and you are pretty sure it is not on any deployment list you have seen.																						
109	109		301									You figure the higher-ups must have been pushing for more Constructs so that they can save the starving conservation areas from despair.																						
110	110		302								You don't believe in miracles, do you, Haicma?	111																						
111	111		301								Haicma	Miracles? The occurrences of impossible odds?	1																					
112	112		301									Perhaps it is just a spur of the moment, or perhaps you have been affected by the dropping estimated success rate in the rescue report, but you do not want her to draw that conclusion.																						
113	113		302								If we keep trying, maybe our efforts will turn into a miracle.	114																						
114	114		301								Haicma	That is just your one-sided perspective. Miracles are merely after-the-fact conclusions.	1																					
115	115		302								But miracles exist. The conservation area is one of them, and so is this encounter.	116																						
116	116		301								Haicma	A correction: we had a 1.4% chance of encountering each other this time. That is a higher possibility than what humans have traditionally considered a miracle.	1																					
117	117		302								So, if we meet again after this...	118																						
118	118		302								Will you believe in miracles, then?	119																						
119	119		301								Haicma	Why do you keep pushing me to believe in miracles?	1																					
120	120		302								Because sending you to this conservation area...	121																						
121	121		302								...Is to create miracles in the first place.	122																						
122	122		401							1	36																							
123	123		301								Haicma	...	1																					
124	124		301									Haicma gazes at the human's departing figure.																						
125	125		301									"If you knew that my purpose was not what you expected, you would have understood why your statement was false from the very start."																						
126	126		301									Her processor has long arrived at this conclusion, but Haicma cannot communicate this message no matter what.																						
127	127		301									She might have agreed with the human if she were a Construct. They may be machines physically, but they still share the same souls as humans.																						
128	128		301									Which is why Constructs are not accepted into the Church of Machina.																						
129	129		204							1																								
130	130		301								Haicma	Machines do not make mistakes. It has always been like that.	1																					
131	131		301									She does not worry about being heard. The human has long vanished at the end of the corridor after waving goodbye.																						
132	132		301									She watches that corner until a passing breeze rattles the paper.																						
133	133		301									She should also go now...

138	138		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		When the night has come, and the land is quiet, Haicma, having returned to her base, takes out a piece of paper and places it on a drawing board.																						
139	139		401							2	910																							
140	140		301									Slowly, the empty world is filled with colors and lines.																						
141	141		301									In the center of it is the departing figure of a human, walking farther and father away.																						
142	142		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					This is Haicma's first painting in many years.
