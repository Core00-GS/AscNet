57	58		301									This preposterous absurdity ought to feel distasteful, but it feels serene instead with her presence.																						
58	59		301									And yet, she does not react to your approach in the open. It seems that she has entered eternal sleep.

70	72		301									And her other hand presses against your neck.																						
71	73		302								!!!	74																						
72	74		301									Her function still works perfectly. She avoided the anomaly scanner only because she was sleeping.																						
73	75		301									But you have never seen Constructs who would let their guard down this much while resting. She had no awareness of her surroundings as if she had shut her system down.																						
74	76		302								(Try to reach for your pistol)	77																						
75	77		301									Her grip tightens. You cannot be certain that you can take her down in one shot even if you are Bob Munden incarnated.

77	79		301									Her delicate face remains unblemished like an exhibit carefully prepared.																						
78	80		301									At this distance, even the smallest flinch cannot fool the visual module of a Construct who is engaged in battle.																						
79	81		301									But she has not killed you outright, which means...																						
80	82		301									With great difficulty, you gesture toward the patch on your arm, indicating that you come from Babylonia and not a Scavenger looting for parts.																						
81	83		302								Sorry for interrupting your sleep.	84

86	88		401							1	5																							
87	89		301									Your brief quarrel and her hostility seem to have melted from the sunlight. What remains now is only a lady conversing with a stranger.																						
88	90		301									Judging from her clothing, you believe she is a Construct from the conservation area nearby.																						
89	91		301								Haicma	Did I look like I was "sleeping" like a human to you?	1																					
90	92		302								The kind that you don't wake up from, perhaps.	93	Not really...	93																				
91	93		301									The lady stops asking and picks up a piece of paper.																						
92	94		301								Haicma	Improvement required...	1																					
93	95		301								Haicma	Lacking detailed explanation on the different stages...	1																					
94	96		301									She murmurs as if reflecting on the results of an experiment.																						
95	97		302								Excuse me... What are you doing?	98																						
96	98		204							1																								
97	99		301								Haicma	Studying how to "sleep" like a human.	1																					
98	100		301									She gathers all the paper, stacking them nicely on the table.																						
99	101		301									You have learned of something like this from the staff in Star of Life. After becoming Constructs for a while, some people may feel some kind of unease.																						
100	102		301									It is not caused physically—not a hardware issue, per se. It comes from the cognitive dissonance one feels after losing their flesh and blood, their way of life completely upended.																						
101	103		301									Unable to adjust mentally, some of them find it difficult to accept their new identities. Mimicking past behaviors is a sign of that.																						
102	104		301									Apparently, the lady before you is planning exactly that.																						
103	105		302								Can I ask you what these are?	106																						
104	106		301								Haicma	Activity logs that are called "diaries."	1																					
105	107		301								Haicma	But their information seems to have been filtered. The records are not complete, and their details are lacking. More of a summary, I think.	1																					
106	108		301								Haicma	Therefore, it's been difficult to recreate them. There are too many unpredictable variables.	1																					
107	109		301									Diaries are not bookkeeping. It is hard to demand too many details from them...																						
108	110		301									But if she wants to experience the life before becoming a Construct, is there not a more direct way laid out before her than imitating these records?																						
109	111		302								What about writing a diary?	112																						
110	112		204							1	3																							
111	113		301								Haicma	Writing... a diary?	1																					
112	114		301									Unlike the data stored in her electronic components, human memories always fade away.																						
113	115		301									Which is why humans need to select and record the important parts. It is an act to counter their innate flaw.																						
114	116		302								You want to experience what it feels like to be human again, right?	117																						
115	117		204							1	7																							
116	118		301								Haicma	Again? Right.	1																					
117	119		204							1																								
118	120		301								Haicma	My calculation suggests that this proposal has a higher chance of success.	1																					
119	121		301									Instead of forcing herself to repeat what cannot be recreated from those diaries, she should perhaps try to choose the memories worth preserving and record them herself.																						
120	122		301									She can reflect on and analyze them during this process. After all, recording facts is not the only purpose to write a diary.																						
121	123		301									Opening her notebook again, she seems to be about to put the idea into action.																						
122	124		301									But before that, you should probably do something about a Construct acting alone outside the conservation area...

141	143		301									With her gone, time moves again in the room as if your encounter was just a fantasy, a memory displayed by the abandoned house.																						
142	144		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					But she is a Construct from the nearby conservation area. Chances are you will meet again.
