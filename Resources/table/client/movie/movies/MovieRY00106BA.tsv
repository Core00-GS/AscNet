17	17		301									Bianca seems to have been slightly shocked by the sudden voice, but soon gives a nod as if she already understands the situation.																						
18	18		301								Bianca	You have the voiceprint of the Gray Raven Commandant. Did something happen?	1																					
19	19		301								Bianca	The Purifying Force is not with us. The voiceprint suggests you are the Gray Raven Commandant. Is that so?	1																					
20	20		301								Bianca	First, I need to correct one thing. I'm ■■■■■, not Bianca...	1																					
21	21		301								Bianca	...What's going on? Why can't I say my name properly?	1																					
22	22		302								(Explain the situation)	23																						
23	23		301								Bianca	So you were forced into this connection chamber and this April Fool's game... What a terrible prank this is.	1																					
24	24		301								Bianca	Wait a sec. You mentioned you heard a male voice among the kidnappers, is that right?	1																					
25	25		301								Bianca	...Does he have an outgoing, passionate voice?	1																					
26	26		302								I don't know who you're talking about.	27	The culprit probably isn't who you're thinking.	28

30	30		301								Bianca	It concerns me a lot... I'll join this mission to search for you, Commandant.	1																					
31	31		301								Bianca	You mentioned I look like Bianca to you. Is it because both of us are captains...?	1																					
32	32		204							1	4																							
33	33		301								Bianca	Does this mean I look like a female in a short skirt... to you?	1
