9	9		301									Walking down the stairs is the familiar feminine figure of Qu, yet vastly different from her imposter on the ship. Her footsteps ring in majesty as she approaches.																						
10	10		301								Qu	And—this place has a name. The Observatory. Not just any "tower."	1																					
11	11		302								This place is called the Observatory?	12	Why is it called that?	15																				
12	12		301								Qu	Indeed. Its height is to observe the stars.	1

16	14	102	301								Qu	There is no better description of the folly of human conceits, than what you describe.	1																					
17	15	102	301								Qu	From here, you can see the stars filling the universe. Learn that Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.	1

22	17		301								Ayla	Things are not looking good. Some Ascendants found their way in here. We have to protect Huaxu and keep it from falling into their hands.	2																					
23	18		302								You still have Huaxu with you, right?	105	Has Gabriel come?	107

35	22		301								Liv	...	2																					
36	23		301								Ayla	Liv, you've been like this since we got here. Are you not feeling well?	1																					
37	24		301									Ayla is relieved to hear Qu's reply. Meanwhile, Liv's face turns grim as she fiddles with the device in her hand, as if beset by self-doubt.																						
38	25		301								Lee	What's wrong, Liv?	3																					
39	26		301								Liv	That Qu, the leader of Kowloong, is an Ascendant...	2																					
40	27		302								What?	28	You sure?	30																				
41	28	29	301								Ayla	This city's being ruled by an Ascendant? How's that even possible?	1																					
42	29	31	301								Liv	It might be hard to believe, but it's true. I've ran several scans to reconfirm.	2																					
43	30	31	301								Liv	Yes. I've ran several scans to test. She displays similar viral reactions to Alpha and Roland.	2																					
44	31		301								Lee	What the hell...? If she's an Ascendant, why would she start this war? To lure us here?	3

50	33		301							1	Liv	You make it sound like... you aren't one of them.	2																					
51	34		301								Qu	There's no rule that says all Ascendants have to band together, or that an Ascendant can't govern a human city.	1																					
52	35		301								Qu	I'm an outlier, that's all. In order to contain the virus spreading from me, I cloistered myself in the Observatory, running every aspect of this city in these confines.	1																					
53	36		301									Ayla tenses up as Qu approaches. Qu wears a smirk on her face, but her hands are still tightly held to her weapon. A dreadful silence reigns the tower.																						
54	37		302								What is it that Kowloong wants?	38	What's your endgame here?	39																				
55	38	40	301								Qu	Kowloong Corp has but one goal—To preserve all that is of value on Earth.	1																					
56	39	40	301								Qu	I am but the vessel of our common wish—To preserve all that is of value on Earth.	1																					
57	40		301								Liv	Preserve Earth...?	2																					
58	41		301								Qu	Babylonia has been doing something similar, I know. With historical artifacts, pre-pandemic data, and whatnot, yes?	1

61	42		301							1	Ayla	Are you talking about WGAA?	2																					
62	43		301								Qu	But that is nothing compared to our grand design.	1																					
63	44		301								Ayla	How could you? Me, the president, everyone! We're all working in earnest to study and rejuvenate human cultures, to prepare for the day we reclaim Earth...	2																					
64	45		301								Qu	That day will never come.	1

68	47		301								Qu	All your talk about reclaiming Earth, reconnecting the world is nothing but a joke. History ended the moment the virus broke out.	1																					
69	48		302								We haven't ended.	49	The virus will be another episode in our history.	50																				
70	49	51	301								Qu	We're all on borrowed time. How much longer do you think you can last?	1																					
71	50	51	301								Qu	Another episode in human history... So you honestly think there's still a future for Earth?	1																					
72	51		301								Qu	Foolish though your ideals may be, your words speak to something special. Tell me your name, commandant of Babylonia.	1																					
73	52		302								(Tell her your name)																							
74	53		301								Qu	【kuroname】, your name will be inscribed in a special place. Consider it a parting gift.	1

77	54		301							1	Liv	Parting gift?	2																					
78	55		301								Qu	Life will fade, machines will break down, the world will perish. This is why things that have value must be preserved. Kowloong will be the final epithet of Earth.	1																					
79	56		301								Qu	When all lights go out, when all goes dark, this place will still burn. Like fire, we will stay a beacon for visitors in the eons to come.	1																					
80	57		301								Qu	They will know that we, "humanity," lived. Like fossils, we will leave behind a legacy. This is Kowloong. This, is Tabula Akasha.	1

83	58		301							1	Lee	Tabula Akasha...	2																					
84	59		301								Qu	Resistance is futile. Accept death with grace. That's the way we, the once ruler of Earth, should bow out.	1																					
85	60		301								Qu	And through this war, I finally realized that to complete the Tabula Akasha, the world must first be ended.	1																					
86	61		301								Lee	You are going to...	2																					
87	62		301								Qu	I came here expecting a certain Ascendant first, but no matter.	1																					
88	63		301								Qu	Earth's demise is set in stone. The question of who goes first and who goes later is inconsequential.	1																					
89	64		301								Qu	Fall, and become history, Babylonia.	1

101	69		302								Are you asking me to abandon you?	70	I can fight too.	70																				
102	70		301								Lee	This is the best strategy... Go a few more floors up so that the reinforcements can pick up your signal.	2
