4	5		301								Huaxu	Lady Qu, why did you decline Luna's request?

6	7		301							1	Qu	Huaxu, I know I must hand you over to Luna—	1																					
7	8		301								Qu	—But for a person like her, there is a difference in trust between me giving her something, and her taking something away.	1																					
8	10		301								Huaxu	Why must you destroy them? Isn't the end result the same for the both of you?																						
9	12		301								Qu	Not at all. We are destined to be at odds with each other. I wish to continue the human race, while she wishes to completely erase humanity's existence.	1																					
10	13		301								Qu	So when she uncovers the truth, she will try to stop the Tabula Akasha.	1																					
11	14		301								Qu	Even with the city enshrouded, there's no guarantee that the ruins beneath the city will go unnoticed by Luna.	1																					
12	15		301								Qu	Therefore, it is paramount that we nip this in the bud and eliminate all that threatens the Tabula Akasha.	1																					
13	17		301								Huaxu	What about the people of Babylonia?																						
14	19		301								Qu	They shall serve as my pawns in the fight against the Ascendants until their very last breath.	1

16	22		301								Huaxu	Understood. What do you require of me?																						
17	24		301								Qu	Backup the M.I.N.D. data for all of the Primes and Phecda in Kowloong, record all battlefield intel and maximize their memory data, then save everything onto the Tabula Akasha.	1																					
18	26		301								Huaxu	Understood. Shall we inform the citizens?																						
19	28		301								Qu	No. The fewer who know, the better.	1																					
20	30		301								Huaxu	Roger.																						
21	32		301								Qu	When people look up to the Sovereign, they see what they want to see.	1																					
22	33		301								Qu	But in fact, they only get what the Sovereign chooses to give.	1																					
23	34		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	Let me give them one last show before the curtain falls.	1
