14	10		301								Atiel	We're just messing around... It's fine!	1																					
15	11		301									Far away from battle, you see Simon and Atiel frolicking with children.																						
16	12		301									A few armed fishermen are off to the side. Looks like they are the ones living in the residential regions that Simon mentioned.

20	13		301							1	Evan	Oh! Rosetta! Rosetta, you're back?!	1																					
21	14		301									Before you introduce yourselves, a child in a thick downy jacket, wearing a shiny gadget around his neck, notices you and the others.

29	17		301							1	Diana	Anyway, what brings you here?	3																					
30	18		301								Evan	I came with everyone to live here not long ago. Then those monsters attacked... But since you're here, Rosetta, that means we can go home!	1																					
31	19		301								Rosetta	Mh-hm. I'll have you home in no time.	2																					
32	20		301								Evan	Anyway, who's the egghead?	1																					
33	2000		302								Egghead...	21	We've met before.	22																				
34	21		301								Diana	That's just how the kids call Polar Soldiers. Since it's all round and tubby.	3																					
35	22		301								Rosetta	This is the commandant of Gray Raven. Remember?	2																					
36	23		301								Evan	Oh... Yeah, I remember!	1																					
37	24		301									Rosetta's reminder seems to have jogged Evan's memory. He immediately tries to shield Rosetta behind him, like a mother hen protecting her chicks.

42	26	1011	301								Rosetta	I'm sorry. Evan is...	2																					
43	27	1011	301								Evan	Hmph, we'll see!	1

45	28		301							1	Fisher	Alright, 'right. Business time for the big boys, fellas. Kids, you go back to yer kiddie pile.	2																					
46	29		301								Evan	Hey! Wait!	1																					
47	1012		202							1																								
48	30		301									Ignoring Evan's protest, a fisherman promptly lifts Evan and chucks him right onto a giant snow ball made by the children.																						
49	31		301								Fisher	Sorry fellas, these kids are just trouble.	2																					
50	32		301									A close inspection reveals the fisherman as one you have seen in Murmansk. His expression is much softer now, looking squarely at Rosetta and the other Forest Guards.

54	33		301							1	Diana	Rosetta, this is what I was talking about earlier.	1																					
55	34		301								Rosetta	Yeah... Those who accept us may be few, but everything will become better. We're all pointed in the right direction.	2

59	35		301							1	Simon	But no matter what, the Forest Guards will still be branded as "sinners"...	2																					
60	36		301								Atiel	Don't salt the wound, Simon! You just never know how to talk!	1																					
61	37		301								Simon	I'm just stating the fact. And stop bumping me with your elbow!	2																					
62	38		301									Atiel and Simon walk over, but Atiel is somehow limping, as if parts of her frame are malfunctioning.																						
63	2002		302								Where are you hurt?	39	So we're going on the offense?	40																				
64	39	41	301								Atiel	A joint on my foot is probably just on the fritz... But it should be okay. I can continue to fight.	1																					
65	40	41	301								Simon	Yes, I've scouted the area as well.	2																					
66	41		301								Simon	Anyhow, we'll set out in ten minutes with the remaining Forest Guards and lure the bionics into battle.	2

68	1019		201							1	500088	4																						
69	42		301							1	Diana	Gotcha... That should prevent the base from sustaining any collateral damage.	1																					
70	1020		201							1	500206		400																					
71	1021		201							2	500201		-400																					
72	43		301							1	Simon	Exactly. The fishermen also wish to join the fray. So we plan on having them protect the rear.	2																					
73	44		301								Simon	Atiel, you and I will protect the rear along with the fishermen.	2																					
74	520		204							1	5																							
75	45		301								Atiel	Wait, why won't you let me join the frontline, Simon? I'm just a little banged up is all...	1																					
76	46		301								Simon	It's not because of that. You're just needed in the rear... Well... Partly also because of your injuries. After the battle you can return to the base to get fixed up. Then, you can rejoin the front line.	2																					
77	47		301								Atiel	...	1																					
78	1022		202							1	2																							
79	1023		201							1	500088																							
80	48		301							1	Diana	So, we'll be responsible for luring the enemy. Simon and the others will support from the rear, correct? „Äêkuroname„Äë, you'll have to lead the Forest Guard.	1																					
81	2003		302								Me?	49	Leave it to me.	50																				
82	49	1024	301								Diana	Yeah. We don't have the modules to connect with you, but we'll be sure to carry out your orders.	1																					
83	50	1024	301								Diana	Glad I can trust you.	1

85	1025		201							2	500214	1	-400																					
86	51		301							1	Rosetta	So we launch a joint attack like last time, Diana?	2																					
87	52		301								Diana	Yes. Let us blaze across the battlefield like before.	1																					
88	1026		204							2	14																							
89	53		301								Rosetta	No, I'm afraid I can't anymore, not with my current...	2																					
90	54		301								Diana	No worries, we've got spare modules.	1																					
91	1027		204							2	4																							
92	55		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Rosetta	Spare modules?!	2
