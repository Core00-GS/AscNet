7	7		301									A long, long nightmare. A nightmare where Commandant is nowhere to be found.																						
8	8		301									An attempt to sit up—only to find the operating system for the limbs disconnected.

13	13		301							1	Hassen	You're awake, Lucia?	2																					
14	14		301									"President Hassen, are we in Babylonia, or somewhere else?" Words. Lips. Mouth moving, or not? Sound does not come out.																						
15	15		301								Hassen	I know you have a lot of questions, but right now, you need to rest.	2

17	16		301									The president's words jog my memories. It was a loss against Alpha, again.																						
18	17		301									—Losing to myself.																						
19	18		301									It wasn't enough. It ended in failure. I wanted to show Commandant. I wanted Commandant to be proud. But, I lost again.																						
20	19		301									In the end, when I was lying in Commandant's arms, I tried to smile, so that Commandant wouldn't be as worried about me.																						
21	20		301								Lucia	Where's... C-Commandant?																						
22	501		201							2	500011																							
23	21		301								Hassen	I sent Gray Raven to join the resistance against Gabriel. I had Ayla bring a comms device with them, but then at some point we lost connection.	2																					
24	22		301									That doesn't sound good. I need to get to Commandant as soon as possible.																						
25	23		301								Lucia	Agh... Argh!																						
26	24		301				RImgBg1Shake					I need to be there for everyone... be there for Commandant. Something tells me that I'll regret it if I don't. I mobilize every working part of my body and crawl out of the bed.																						
27	25		301								Hassen	Hold on, what are you doing?	2																					
28	26		301								Lucia	Send me to battle...																						
29	27		301								Hassen	You're too damaged. Let the others do the fighting.	2

33	31		301							1	Asimov	If she wants to fight, let her. We brought a spare frame, remember?	1																					
34	32		301								Hassen	That frame is still being configured. And you know full well what letting Lucia use that frame would mean.	2																					
35	33		301								Asimov	A frame containing Alpha's data can never be fully configured. Initialization is required before it can be used, no matter the case.	1																					
36	34		301									I don't understand what they're talking about, but the word "frame" stands out for me.																						
37	35		301								Lucia	Whatever works. Let me use it.

41	37		301								Asimov	Lucia, we developed a new frame for you. Built on all the data Gray Raven has gained so far.	1																					
42	38		301								Lucia	As in what we've been through...?																						
43	39		301								Asimov	You can say that, but your experiences alone aren't enough. If you've realized that you are a replica, then you know how powerful the original Lucia is.	1																					
44	40		301									I know. That's why I don't want to lose.																						
45	41		301								Asimov	That's why I tuned up this frame with data from Alpha. Unedited. The entire set.	1																					
46	42		301								Lucia	That's... what the initialization is for?																						
47	43		301								Asimov	Yes. The frame is data-overloaded. So if you want to use it, your thought model will have to be reconfigured through initialization.	1																					
48	44		301								Asimov	We don't know what will become of you after the initialization. More Lucia, more Alpha, or someone completely different? No one can tell.	1																					
49	45		301								Asimov	Even if it all works out and you're back in operation, you will longer be yourself.	1																					
50	46		301								Asimov	Constructs can acquire memories by loading themselves with data. But you will only be reading these memories, not living them. They will always be someone else's.	1

53	47		301							1	Hassen	Asimov, this is too much... And even if we activate that frame, there's still no way of getting her back in battle, right?	2																					
54	48		301								Asimov	We do have a decommissioned single-person aircraft left. Still functional enough to take her to Kowloong.	1																					
55	300		301								Asimov	I just caught a signal from Gray Raven... They might be in danger.	1																					
56	49		301								Asimov	Your frame, Lucia. Your call.	1

59	51		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Using this frame is tantamount to suicide—it will kill Lucia, this current Lucia. That's what Asimov is implying.																						
60	52		301									That's a small price to pay, much smaller than I expected. Everyone has a grim look on their face, and yet I can't help smiling.																						
61	53		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Wait for me, Commandant.
