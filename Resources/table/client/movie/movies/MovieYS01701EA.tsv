6	6		301							1	Lucia	Hi, lady.	1																					
7	7		201							1	500075																							
8	8		301							1	Heisen	Hi, who are you?	1																					
9	9		201							1	1021001																							
10	10		301							1	Lucia	We're the Gray Raven.	1																					
11	11		201							1	500075																							
12	12		301							1	Heisen	Gray Raven? The name seems to have appeared in the information I just uploaded... forget it.	1																					
13	13		301								Heisen	It doesn't matter what it is if I can do my research.	1																					
14	14		201							1	1031001																							
15	15		301							1	Liv	Research?	1																					
16	16		201							1	500075																							
17	17		301							1	Heisen	I study biochemistry, so I could tell it the moment you showed up. You are not living organisms, except for that one, right?	1																					
18	18		201							1	1031001																							
19	19		301							1	Liv	The thing is...	1																					
20	20		201							1	500075																							
21	21		301							1	Heisen	Mechanoid... not the most interesting research field for me, but the thought of carrying out research that I haven't been able to do for a long time made me excited!	1																					
22	22		301								Heisen	The white-haired lady over there, could you open your head for me?	1																					
23	23		201							1	1031001	7																						
24	24		301							1	Liv	What? Me?	1																					
25	25		301								Liv	How-how would I open it...?	1																					
26	26		302								Wait, Liv.	27	No, Liv!	27																				
27	27		201							1	1011001																							
28	28		301							1	Lee	...Are you seriously thinking about opening your head?	1																					
29	29		201							1	500075																							
30	30		301							1	Heisen	Ah, is it a non-removable part? Biological self-healing, proliferation, division, none of them can be done? What a bummer...	1																					
31	31		201							1	1011001																							
32	32		301							1	Lee	...Giving up, huh?	1																					
33	33		201							1	500075																							
34	34		301							1	Heisen	Where's my scalpel? Oh wait, what are the tools for surgical operations now, the chainsaw, drill, or the harvester?	1																					
35	35		302								Lee, close the terminal.	36	Stop her!	36																				
36	36		201							1	1011001																							
37	37		301							1	Lee	Damn, the test isn't over yet!	1																					
38	38		302								Force it to close!	39	Wait...	39																				
39	39		204							1	10																							
40	40		301								Lee	...Calm down and think about it, she couldn't possibly touch anything right now.	1																					
41	41		201							1	500075																							
42	42		301							1	Heisen	Ahâ€”	1																					
43	43		301								Heisen	Turns out that's how it is...	1																					
44	44		301								Heisen	As the data says, this is how I'm like...	1																					
45	45		301								Heisen	There's nothing left once dead.	1																					
46	46		301								Heisen	I can't do experiments or pick up scalpels and dispensers anymore...	1																					
47	47		301								Heisen	Wah...	1																					
48	48		201							1	1031001	14																						
49	49		301							1	Liv	Are you okay?	1																					
50	50		201							1	1011001	10																						
51	51		301							1	Lee	Liv, she just tried to cut your head open.	1																					
52	52		201							1	500075																							
53	53		301							1	Heisen	Ah, I figured it out.	1																					
54	54		201							1	1031001	7																						
55	55		301							1	Liv	No more crying?	1																					
56	56		201							1	500075																							
57	57		301							1	Heisen	Can I have one of those mechanical bodies like yours?	1																					
58	58		301								Heisen	The shape doesn't matter, as long as I can pick up a harvester, chainsaw, or drill. If not, a scalpel or dispenser will do.	1																					
59	59		302								I don't think so.	60	Of course.	62																				
60	60		201							1	1011001	10																						
61	61	64	301							1	Lee	I'm also against it.	1																					
62	62		201							1	1021001	4																						
63	63		301							1	Lucia	Commandant, I've got a different opinion.	1																					
64	64		201							1	1021001	3																						
65	65		301							1	Lucia	We're facing severe problems in terms of technical aspects, application approval or follow-ups.	1																					
66	66		201							1	1031001	6																						
67	67		301							1	Liv	But... could you please assist us as tactical memory?	1																					
68	68		204							1	14																							
69	69		301								Liv	Your experience data is quite valuable for us...	1																					
70	70		201							1	500075																							
71	71		301							1	Heisen	Since my lovely subject asked, I'll agree to it. But...	1																					
72	72		201							1	1011001																							
73	73		301							1	Lee	Forget it, she won't open her head for you.	1																					
74	74		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lee	...Memory: Heisen. Test passed and recycle completed.	1
