5	6		301			RImgBg1Shake						Camu roars angrily, launching heavy blows at Roland with the greatsword in his hand.																						
6	7		301								Roland	Hah... Thought you could only bark like some rabid dog, turns out you can bite.																						
7	38		401							2	10006001																							
8	8		301			RImgBg1Shake						Roland grits his teeth to fend off another blow from Camu, but his stance is getting unsteady, even beginning to tilt back uncontrollably.																						
9	10		301								Camu	Turn this frame! Back to! What it was! Now!

11	12		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Roland draws his shotgun to fire six shots at Camu's face, then uses the opening to leap backwards.

23	23		301								Roland	—Anzus	1																					
24	24		301									Just like earlier, Roland's whisper seems to be doing a number on Camu's hearing modules, causing great difficulty for Camu to even raise his greatsword.
