4	4		301			DialogEnable						The twins have stopped their attack since Asslam severed its carriages. They simply follow the detached train from behind with their unique movement.																						
5	5		301									They watch, curiously, the inside of the train through where the carriages broke off, as if it is a headless rooster still moving about.																						
6	6		301									Countless Hetero-Creatures and Hetero-Sapiens converge at the sides of the twins, replacing the two observers as the assailants who attempt to breach the carriages.																						
7	7		301									In the beginning, people try to block the opening, stopping the amassing Hetero-Creatures.																						
8	8		301									Yet, every time they succeed, the Hetero-Creatures will launch a new wave of attack and tear their defenses apart.																						
9	9		301									The passengers have lasted one day and one night in this relentless struggle.																						
10	10		301									Both Constructs and humans have grown weary in this intense battle of attrition, but the Hetero-Creatures have only been picking up speed as if they are guided by masterful instructors.																						
11	11		301									Only when the time the sun sets once more does the company fighting on the frontline of the train have a chance to rest before night falls.

14	14		301							1	Lee	How are we looking?	1																					
15	15		301								Sophia	Twelve carriages remaining after the split.	2																					
16	16		301									Sophia and Lee are repairing the damaged equipment in haste while keeping an eye out for more attacks.																						
17	17		202							1	2				1																			
18	18		301									Seeing the fight has temporarily ceased, the scared refugees hiding deeper inside poke their heads out.

20	20		301							1	Middle-aged Refugee	How are you all doing? Where are the folks who were in this carriage?	1

22	22		201							2	500125	1	400																					
23	23		301							1	Jamilah	I've placed most of them in other cities' conservation areas before meeting up with the Forsaken.	2																					
24	24		301									Jamilah sits on her chair elegantly, her expression unfazed, as though she has long been used to confronting danger.																						
25	25		301								Jamilah	Still, some of them refused to leave despite the situation, and you have witnessed their fate.	2																					
26	26		301								Middle-aged Refugee	...	1																					
27	27		202							1	2				1																			
28	28		301									The refugee immediately returns to his seat after that.

30	30		301							1	Watanabe	Akdilek has suffered a great loss in this rescue. After this is over, the Forsaken will not forget what you have done.	1																					
31	31		301									Also a leader himself, Watanabe, however, just looks exhausted.																						
32	32		301									Everyone the Forsaken has taken in has witnessed the torments that Watanabe and the Forsaken went through.																						
33	33		301									The pain has long past what one could reasonably bear. Yet the Forsaken are still standing here, like a lighthouse in the storm, unyielding in their oath to not leave anyone behind.

36	36		301							1	Jamilah	Don't worry about that. We're here because I have my own considerations and plans.	2																					
37	37		301								Jamilah	With what has transpired, no one gets to remain uninvolved. We should have stood together in the first place.	2																					
38	38		301								Jamilah	Not to mention that Babylonia has agreed to compensate for all damages.	2																					
39	39		201							1	500026		400																					
40	40		301							1	Lee	Is that part of the deal?	1																					
41	41		301								Jamilah	Call it a provisional supplement term. Both Babylonia and Akdilek want the same thing.	2																					
42	42		301								Jamilah	—To save lives and seek new possibilities.	2

44	44		201							1	1101001																							
45	45		301							1	Watanabe	So does the Forsaken, when you put it like that.	1																					
46	46		202							1					1																			
47	47		301									Watanabe frowns, turning back to the interior of the carriage. The 35 Constructs who gathered in the base are fighting to protect the 587 survivors hiding here.																						
48	48		301									Most of them are members of the Forsaken, but there are also many patients that they have temporarily taken in.																						
49	49		301									After the event at the Pulia Forest Park Ruins, Watanabe has been leading the different Forsaken bases to take in those who were affected, giving them shelter.																						
50	50		301									The Forsaken have always been held in high regard in these areas, but that has also led to them taking in way more people than the conservation areas.																						
51	51		301									Not long after the twins attacked, a large gathering of Hetero-Creatures charged their base as if being summoned.																						
52	52		301									Suffering huge casualties, Watanabe was forced to take those remaining to escape from their base.

55	55		301							1	Changyu	You're welcome. But you'll have to help us fix the train in the future.	1																					
56	56		301								Watanabe	Of course.	2

59	59		301							1	Shrek	Is there a future?	1																					
60	60		301									Shrek, having boarded the train alongside the Forsaken, is leaning by the shaking seats, his brows furrowed as he watches the working Constructs before him.																						
61	61		301									Ever since he came on board, the normally talkative young man has been looking around with worry and disgust, almost as if he fears not just the monsters chasing them but the train itself as well.																						
62	62		301								Shrek	I know it's not my place to say it, but those two and their siblings are still after us. It's clear that we can't outrun them, and we can't win by attrition.	1																					
63	63		301								Shrek	I might just be a civilian, and I'm grateful to be saved, but both the folks behind us and I can't bear to lose any more of you.	1																					
64	64		301									Hearing that, a corner of Jamilah's mouth ever so subtly rises.																						
65	65		301								Shrek	Especially you, Watanabe. You don't have to say it—I know you're almost at your limit, having been operating nonstop for the past month.	1																					
66	66		201							1	1101001		-400																					
67	67		201							2	500125	1	400																					
68	68		301							1	Watanabe	But we don't have a choice right now.	1																					
69	69		301								Jamilah	Isn't there a new possibility?	2																					
70	70		301								Jamilah	When we were putting together the supplement terms, I received an extra request.	2																					
71	71		301								Jamilah	To help test your new weapon system.	2																					
72	72		201							1	500166		-400																					
73	73		301							1	Lucia	Are you talking about the Omega Prototype?	1																					
74	74		201							2	1101001		400																					
75	75		301							1	Watanabe	We can fight the twins with it?	2																					
76	76		301								Lucia	The effects during our first trial were minor, but they must have improved by now...	1																					
77	77		201							1	500309		-400																					
78	78		301							1	Chrome	That's right. I just received a message—the Operational Command is preparing Phase Two of the prototype, and they're planning to drop it tomorrow.	1																					
79	79		301								Chrome	With the improvements they've made, this Omega Weapon can create a small disinfected area, drawing in the Punishing Virus within.	1																					
80	80		301									Hearing that, everyone's solemn face relaxes a little.																						
81	81		301								Chrome	But its effectiveness is still inconclusive. We should prepare a backup plan.	1																					
82	82		301								Watanabe	Have you confirmed the exact timing and location?	2																					
83	83		301								Chrome	I have. We need to arrive at the station in City 210 by 4 o'clock tomorrow. There, we will receive the new prototype.	1																					
84	84		201							2	500225	5	400																					
85	85		301							1	Changyu	Must it be City 210 and 4 o'clock? That's cutting it real close.	2																					
86	86		301								Chrome	We need to take into account the time needed to depart and meet up with the Support Force. We must hurry and put some distance between the enemy and us.	1																					
87	87		301								Chrome	Not to mention that... it's too dangerous for the civilians to remain on the train. There is another functional base in City 210. People can get off there.	1																					
88	88		301								Chrome	It's more than enough if we just keep a small force of combatants here to draw the twins' attention.	1																					
89	89		301								Chrome	This is why reaching City 210 by 4 o'clock tomorrow seems reasonable.	1

92	92		301							1	Jamilah	I suppose we have to speed up.	1																					
93	93		301									Jamilah smiles, her gaze passing each of those discussing the plan until it stops at Shrek in the back.																						
94	94		301									Through the sound of their discussion, she sends Shrek a message, speaking silently.																						
95	95		301								Jamilah	W-e-l-c-o-m-e-b-a-c-k...	1																					
96	96		201							1	500262

100	100		301							1	Sophia	I'll go help.	2																					
101	101		301									Given how dire the situation is, the Constructs have not noticed the expressions of the two humans, not to mention what Jamilah was saying.																						
102	102		301								Changyu	Then we'll stay here to take care of the minions.	1																					
103	103		301									The boy's fist connects with a Corrupted that is clinging to the broken edge, snapping its neck.																						
104	104		301									—But it only falls into the crowd of Corrupted behind, still in pursuit.																						
105	105		301								Changyu	Back together again? What is this, a march for unity and friendship?	1																					
106	106		201							2	500166	5	-400
