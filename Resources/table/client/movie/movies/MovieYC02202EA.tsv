16	16		304							The ability of Hetero-Creatures to imitate fighting skills is incredible. Their regeneration speed has also reached the expected standard.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory449.jpg		1																			
17	17		304							The Punishing Red Tide is spreading on the surface and capturing food as planned. Everything is developing steadily.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory449.jpg		1

23	23		304							However, he doesn't seem to have understood anything regarding the experiments. Instead, he seems more concerned with the "nature of Ascnet".	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory449.jpg		1																			
24	24		304							Fool, that isn't of our concern. Our mission is to pass on the will of Ascnet.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory449.jpg		1
