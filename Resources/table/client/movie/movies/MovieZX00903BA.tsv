4	3		301			DialogEnable				1	Allen	So, President Hassen, would you like to consider my request?	1																					
5	4		201							1	500011																							
6	5		301							1	Hassen	We are at war. WGAA is a civilian organization, and as their leader you shouldn't even be here in the command room.	1																					
7	6		301								Hassen	Let alone making requests.	1																					
8	7		201							1	500111																							
9	8		301							1	Allen	It has nothing to do with my business. Or should I say, nothing to do with me, don't you think?	1																					
10	9		301								Allen	I understand it is quite sudden. But it's worth your consideration.	1																					
11	10		201							1	500011																							
12	11		301							1	Hassen	...Mr. Allen, I can hardly accept your request without sufficient evidence.	1																					
13	12		301								Hassen	You're asking to search for a Construct lost years ago in an investigation, in the space station...	1																					
14	13		301								Hassen	I'm afraid we don't have enough manpower to do so.	1																					
15	14		201							1	500111																							
16	15		301							1	Allen	We have a girl with great senses in the 2nd Archaeological Team. She was the one who found the hidden data and decrypted it.	1																					
17	16		201							1	500011																							
18	17		301							1	Hassen	Great senses...	1

23	22		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						As the cabin door opens, a fashionable and somewhat special Construct appears.																						
24	23		301								Ayla	Greetings, President Hassen. I am Ayla from the 2nd Archaeological Team. I am responsible for the appraisal of artworks.																						
25	24		301								Allen	And a great young artist in Babylonia, too.																						
26	25		301								Hassen	Oh, I know you... I mean, it's impossible to not know you...																						
27	26		301								Hassen	I had the privilege to appreciate a few works of Miss Ayla's. They are very great indeed.																						
28	27		301								Ayla	I am honored, President Hassen.																						
29	28		301								Hassen	We don't have much time. Talk about your plan.																						
30	4646		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Ayla	Of course, though I hope you can trust my "senses"...																						
31	30		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory45.jpg																								
32	31		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After a brief explanation—																						
33	32		201							1	500011																							
34	33		301							1	Hassen	In short, you've been managing to decipher meaningful signals amidst the white noise interferences from the space station.	1																					
35	34		301								Hassen	And you recently discovered this signal was sent by your friend, a Construct named Selena within the space station.	1																					
36	35		301								Hassen	And the content of the signal is... dialogues from a play called...	1																					
37	36		201							1	500110																							
38	37		301							1	Ayla	The Tempest, by Shakespeare.	1																					
39	38		201							1	500011																							
40	39		301							1	Hassen	...	1																					
41	40		301								Hassen	Operator. Pull a segment of the white noise from the space station and compare it to the parts Ayla mentioned.	1																					
42	41		201							1	500019																							
43	42		301							1	Operator	Roger.	1																					
44	43		301								Operator	...	1																					
45	44		301								Operator	There are... a few similarities, true. But the data we can collect is way too little because of the interference...	1																					
46	45		301								Operator	The chance of it being a coincidence is still very likely.	1																					
47	46		201							1	500110																							
48	47		301							1	Ayla	The parts I can "hear" is much more than what's being recorded here.	1																					
49	48		301								Ayla	I am very certain that this is Selena's voice. And she's still alive.	1																					
50	49		201							1	500011																							
51	50		301							1	Hassen	...	1																					
52	51		202							1					1																			
53	52		301									Looking into Ayla's eyes, Hassen finds an unwavering resolve in her, a sense of maturity that is seemingly at odds with her appearance.																						
54	53		201							1	500011																							
55	54		301							1	Hassen	Alright. I believe you.	1																					
56	55		301								Hassen	If that presumably-missing Construct from that mission is still alive, then it is our duty to bring her back.	1																					
57	56		201							1	500111																							
58	57		301							1	Allen	To protect Ayla, I think that—	1																					
59	58		201							1	500110																							
60	59		301							1	Ayla	Chairman, only I can sense Selena's "voice" for now. Plus, the others in the Archaeological Team all have their ongoing works.	1																					
61	60		301								Ayla	I think it's sufficient to just send me on this mission.	1																					
62	61		201							1	500111																							
63	62		301							1	Allen	It's not that I don't trust your capabilities to protect yourself...	1																					
64	63		301								Allen	It's just... if you find her only to discover that...	1																					
65	64		201							1	500110																							
66	65		301							1	Ayla	I understand. I think I'll know what to do.	1																					
67	66		201							1	500111																							
68	67		301							1	Allen	Fine. Then the last question is... who's sending you there?	1																					
69	68		201							1	500110																							
70	69		301							1	Ayla	...	1																					
71	70		201							1	500011																							
72	71		301							1	Hassen	About that... Celica.	1																					
73	72		201							1	500001																							
74	73		301							1	Celica	Understood. Mr. Watanabe, this way, please.	1																					
75	74		201							1	500080																							
76	75		301							1	Watanabe	Your meetings are truly as boring and pointless as they seem.	1																					
77	76		201							1	500011																							
78	77		301							1	Hassen	Babylonia has received your terms.	1																					
79	78		201							1	500001																							
80	79		301							1	Celica	Releasing Babylonia's information on the surface to the Forsaken, sharing some of the technologies on the upgraded Inver-Devices... and so on.	1																					
81	80		201							1	500080																							
82	81		301							1	Watanabe	That's right. Not one less.	1																					
83	82		201							1	500011																							
84	83		301							1	Hassen	I forgot to ask—how are you doing, Watanabe?	1																					
85	84		201							1	500080																							
86	85		301							1	Watanabe	I don't think now's the time to catch up.	1																					
87	86		201							1	500011																							
88	87		301							1	Hassen	Probably... You're right.	1																					
89	88		301								Hassen	So, Ayla. The responsibility of escorting you will lie on this ace pilot from the Forsaken.	1																					
90	89		202							1					1																			
91	90		301									Ayla approaches Watanabe, observing him curiously.																						
92	91		201							1	500110																							
93	92		301							1	Ayla	Alright.	1																					
94	93		301								Ayla	But I seem to remember that... you're wanted by Babylonia...	1																					
95	94		201							1	500080																							
96	95		301							1	Watanabe	...	1																					
97	96		201							1	500110																							
98	97		301							1	Ayla	And you still come here to negotiate yourself...	1																					
99	98		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Ayla	Intriguing.	1
