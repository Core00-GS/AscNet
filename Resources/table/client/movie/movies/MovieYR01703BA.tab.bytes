7	7		301								???	Ahhhhhhh... Help!																						
8	8		301									The hiss of the Corrupted entwines with the young girl's scream. Encountering Corrupted in a dark and narrow underground passage was akin to falling prey to a hunter's trap. In other words‚Äîthere is no escape.																						
9	9		301									But the strange thing is that the girl's scream seems stiff... and almost indifferent.																						
10	10		201							1	500281																							
11	11		301							1	???	Is that what the protagonist sounds like when she encounters a monster in a story? Words on a page do little justice‚Ä¶	1																					
12	12		301									The girl closes the digital file on the miniature holo-screen in her hand, then a comically large chainsaw for her slender figure appears in its place.

14	14		201							1	500013																							
15	15		301							1	Corrupted	Rargh!!!!!	1																					
16	16		301									The mindless Corrupted continues to roar, oblivious to the change in persona of the girl standing before it.

21	21		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The girl shouts as she sends the Corrupted flying into the air with her giant chainsaw. The poor Corrupted smashes through the ceiling and blasts off at the speed of light.

23	23		401							1	201																							
24	24		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Long awaited sunlight shines through the hole in the ceiling‚Äîfinally shedding light on the slender girl, Nanami.																						
25	25		201							1	500091																							
26	26		301							1	Nanami	What's this? Looks like the Corrupted dropped something...	1																					
27	27		301									Nanami picks up a red envelope from the pile of scraps left by the Corrupted.																						
28	28		301									She looks it over for some time, but she is unable to surmise anything noteworthy. So, she stuffs it into her jacket.																						
29	29		204							1	8																							
30	30		301								Nanami	What a drag... I've looked everywhere, but I can't find anyone to talk to.	1																					
31	31		204							1	1																							
32	32		301								Nanami	I guess I'll make up a reason to go to Babylonia and hang out with the commandant...	1																					
33	33		301									Right at that moment, Nanami, leaning on her chainsaw in a strange posture, glances around the underground passage as glittering lights approach her.																						
34	34		204							1																								
35	35		301								Nanami	Huh? What are they! Corrupted...? No, they can't be...	1																					
36	36		202							1																								
37	37		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She tiptoes into the darkness, overcome with curiosity.																						
38	38		201							1	500091	1																						
39	39		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Nanami	Meow‚Äî! Meow‚Äî!	1																					
40	40		301									She knows they aren't cats, but she still continues to meow in an attempt to sooth the peculiar creatures.																						
41	41		301									As she gets closer, the glittering lights rustle in the darkness and slowly approach her.																						
42	42		204							1																								
43	43		301								Nanami	Huh...? You're...	1																					
44	44		202							1					1																			
45	45		301									Through the sunlight, Nanami sees that the lights are all coming from excavation mechanoids.																						
46	46		301									The mechanoids all have the same bright red coating, which was a rare sight to see.																						
47	47		201							1	500091	1																						
48	48		301							1	Nanami	Aw, look at you cuties!	1																					
49	49		301									More lights appear throughout the underground passage, surrounding Nanami in a far greater number than anticipated.																						
50	50		204							1	5																							
51	51		301								Nanami	Huh? Are you trying... to attack me? Bring it on! I'm not afraid of you!	1																					
52	52		204							1																								
53	53		301									However, the mechanoids show no intention of attacking. Instead, they only rub up against her.																						
54	54		301								Nanami	Are you... thanking me for defeating that Corrupted? Doesn't seem like purely logical behavior...	1																					
55	55		301									A few mechanoids crawl onto Nanami in excitement.																						
56	56		301									Nanami looks down to see that the mechanoids seem to be showing a liking to the red envelope that was dropped by the Corrupted.																						
57	57		204							1																								
58	58		301								Nanami	That's strange... Why do you guys like this so much?	1																					
59	59		202							1					1																			
60	60		301									Nanami can vaguely feel that although these machines are not sentient, they have begun to develop a hive mentality.																						
61	61		301									She pats the mechanoids, trying to sense their will.																						
62	62		201							1	500091																							
63	63		301							1	Nanami	You guys are too weak and primitive... Whether that be mentally or physically.	1																					
64	64		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Nanami	If no one protects you, you won't stand a snowball's chance in hell against even just one of those Corrupted...	1

68	68		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						‚ÄîWho should lead them?																						
69	69		301									‚ÄîIs there only one right way forward?																						
70	70		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					‚ÄîThe only way to create something from nothing, is...																						
71	71		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory6.jpg																								
72	72		401							1	201																							
73	73		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Nanami gradually comes to a halt, leaving only the consciousness of mechanoids dispersing outward.																						
74	74		301									The mechanoids sense a fluctuation in Nanami's consciousness, then instinctively flee like an avalanche from unknown danger.																						
75	75		201							1	500091	5																						
76	76		301							1	Nanami	Hey! Ahhhhh!!!	1																					
77	77		204							1																								
78	78		301									After coming back to her senses, she cries out in regret as she sees the mechanoids disperse.																						
79	79		301								Nanami	Where are you going! HEY!!!	1																					
80	80		301									Nanami searches every nook and cranny of the underground passage, but the mechanoids have already left without a trace. Seems like they're a lot more skilled at hiding than anticipated.																						
81	81		204							1	5																							
82	82		301								Nanami	You're starting to piss me off! I'm not gonna give up that easily!	1																					
83	83		301								Nanami	I'll think of a way to find you... You little...	1																					
84	84		301									Nanami suddenly realizes that the mechanoids have not had a name, but quickly comes up with a nickname.																						
85	85		204							1	1																							
86	86		301								Nanami	I got it! I'll call you "Xi"! Alright, it's decided! I'm gonna catch you Xis, then we'll have fun‚Ä¶	1																					
87	87		301								Nanami	But I don't even know where they are hiding... I'll have to come up with a way to smoke 'em out...	1																					
88	88		202							1					1																			
89	89		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Looking at the red envelope on the ground, a lightbulb appears to go off in her head.
