5	5		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						In an arctic land, a fisher, burdened by a bulging bag of tools, is trudging forward in the snow.																						
6	6		301									Ahead of him is the port shared by members of the Arctic Route Union, with a couple ships lazing nearby. A group of sailors are huddled around a furnace-like heating device, chatting away.																						
7	7		301									The fisher strides up to them and shouts in his signature booming voice.																						
8	8		201							1	500086																							
9	9		301							1	Fisher	Oi, we sailin' today?	1																					
10	10		301									His deafening voice dusts snow off the trees and draws the sailors' attention.																						
11	11		301									The words evidently reach them, but the fisher is met with a "No" gesture by an annoyed-looking sailor.																						
12	12		301								Fisher	Aye aye, c'mon, let's sail today!	1																					
13	13		301									The fisher is aware of the gesture, but he continues on and joins in with the sailors.

17	17		301								Sailor	Naw, won't do.	2																					
18	18		301								Fisher	Yer keep sayin' that over and over. How long ya havin' your vacation?	1																					
19	19		301								Sailor	We ain't slackin', mate. Why else d'ya thunk we're here?	2																					
20	20		301								Fisher	'S roight! Why EVEN are y'all here if ya ain't getting packed for sea?	1																					
21	21		301									The fisher flares up at the sailors. The winds are stable, stable to the point that staying on land is blasphemy. The sea, the fishes call.																						
22	22		301								Fisher	We have them Babyloony-bolognese now, just jab one of 'em serums if it gets all viral-like. C'mon, let's board!	1																					
23	23		301								Sailor	Ugh... Fer the last time, NO SAILING TODAY!	2																					
24	24		301									The fisher was shaking and rattling the sailor. Unable to take it anymore, the sailor stands and tries to reason with the fisher.																						
25	25		301								Sailor	I dunno why yer fishers ain't sharin' pipes with one 'nother, but we've been repeatin' it—the Corrupted in the sea...	2																					
26	26		301								Fisher	Thar's always Corrupted there! And we have them big fat cannons on the ship!	1																					
27	27		301								Sailor	Just listen!	2																					
28	28		301								Sailor	...The Corrupted in the sea's been hivin' it up gettin' all feisty-like. And since whatever, them stray red-eyes been bandin' all together in one place.	2																					
29	29		301								Fisher	Stray reddies...? Even those from the no-man's zones?	1																					
30	30		301								Sailor	Yarr, for sum reason they all dived somewhere. Dunno where they be headed, but they're relayin' it through the sea 'ere.	2																					
31	31		301									Hearing the sailor, the fisher begins to realize the gravity of the situation. He pulls at the tools tilting from his back and slings them astern.																						
32	32		301								Fisher	Uh... We gon' be safe here?	1																					
33	33		301								Sailor	Least for now they're not tryna' land. Simply shoalin' it up here 'fore going somewhere else.	2																					
34	34		301								Fisher	So them Corrupted's getting fewer around here, aye? When they're done swarmin' it all up in the seas, then we should be safe to go?	1																					
35	35		301								Sailor	I guess...	2

38	38		301							1	???	It won't be possible.	1																					
39	39		301									Interrupting the conversation is a spear-wielding centauress, followed by a group of her kind. Just like the fisher, they are bearing bags.

41	41		201							2	500086		-400																					
42	42		301							1	Fisher	Oh, Forest Guards... There ain't any of them Corruptoes here, eh?	2																					
43	43		301									Astonished by the presence of the humanoid hybrid Constructs, the fisher asks inquisitively, curious as to why they are here.																						
44	44		301								Diana	The Corrupted are all in the sea. We're here for something else.	1

46	46		201							2	500087		-400																					
47	47		301							1	Sailor	You mean...	2																					
48	48		301							1	Diana	We don't know when the Corrupted will be back. But this much we know—nothing good will come out of it if they gather up.	1																					
49	49		301								Diana	So can we borrow your ships, sailors?	1																					
50	50		301								Sailor	You tailin' em red-eyes?	2																					
51	51		301								Diana	Yes, to find out what they're up to. I... have a bad feeling about this.	1																					
52	52		301								Sailor	...Whadda we do, Capt?	2																					
53	53		301									The sailor turns to ask the man who has stayed silent all this time. The man ponders, his eyes darting between his ships and the Forest Guards.

55	55		201							1	500139																							
56	56		301								Captain	I can lend you the ships, but on one condition.	1																					
57	57		301									Diana furrows her eyebrows at the captain's response. She falters a little, but she quickly hides her expression.

60	60		301							1	Diana	We don't have much to offer in exchange. If it can go cheaper...	1

62	62		201							1	500139																							
63	63		301							1	Captain	Not for this, no.	2																					
64	64		301									The captain loudly interrupts Diana in a sullen voice. An embarrassed look crosses Diana's face.																						
65	65		202							1																								
66	66		201							1	500088																							
67	67		301							1	Diana	...Because we're sinners?	1

69	69		201							1	500139																							
70	70		301							1	Captain	Pah, you think I still care about that? You can have the ship, sink it, whatever. But all of you must come back 'ere in one piece—that's my condition.	1

72	72		201							1	500088																							
73	73		301							1	Diana	...	1																					
74	74		301									Diana's consternation quickly gives way to joy. She holds the captain's big stretched-out hand.																						
75	75		301							1	Diana	Thank you. We promise to hold up our end of the bargain.	1

80	80		301							1	Sailor	Wait, Captain, are we not going with them?	2																					
81	81		301								Captain	We can't fight. We'll only hold them back if we go, that I'm sure of. Alright then, move it!	1																					
82	82		301									Following the captain's command, the sailors swing to action. Even the fisher, still in a daze, joins the effort. The Forest Guards murmur between themselves.																						
83	83		202							1	2																							
84	84		301								Forest Guard	Didn't know their attitude toward us had changed so much...																						
85	85		201							1	500088																							
86	86		301							1	Diana	Which is all the more reason for us to find out what the Corrupted are up to.	1																					
87	87		301								Diana	Not only to protect ourselves, but also to protect this place.	1																					
88	88		301								Diana	We'll board the ships as soon as they're ready. Forest Guards, prepare to set sail!	1																					
89	89		301								Forest Guard	Understood!
