3	3		301			DialogEnable						Soon after the beginning of the war, the outer ring of the city has already descended into chaos. The cacophonous shrieks of the Corrupted and the clang of weapons are the only things that fill the air.																						
4	4		301									At first, the Babylonia squads were having little trouble fending off the Corrupted, but then they began swarming in. The Corrupted grew in numbers, and things got out of control.

10	10		301									These two Constructs have been separated from their squad. Overwhelmed by the onslaught of the Corrupted, they broke loose from their formation and were chased to a street corner.

17	18		301			RImgBg1Shake						A Corrupted is about to attack the two Constructs, when a slab of rebar-reinforced concrete sends it flying into the air. The two find themselves stunned, before realizing that they were saved.

30	30		301									The words "Support Force" induces innumerable questions in the two Constructs. As far as Constructs know, the Support Force is made up of rank-and-file soldiers or new recruits.																						
31	31		301									That a Construct as powerful as Bridget can be a member of the Support Force is beyond their wildest dreams.

36	37		301								Construct A	Uh, yeah... fair point.	3																					
37	38		301									The two Constructs half-nods, hazily. Right after fixing them up, Bridget hurries off.
