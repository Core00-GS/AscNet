5	5		301									No. 21 carries out routine combat simulations with your help as a commandant, establishing a remote link to keep her M.I.N.D. stable in battle.																						
6	6		301									After a continuous series of adjustments, you and No. 21 begin to synergize more closely, causing the frequency of No. 21's outbursts from M.I.N.D. deviation to gradually lessen.

10	10		301									The combat simulation goes according to plan, with No. 21 executing the mission flawlessly.																						
11	11		301									As you exit the remote link cabin used for combat simulations, you see No. 21 waiting in front of the cabin door.

55	55		301								No. 21	I shouldn't have smiled. That wasn't the appropriate response.	1																					
56	56		301									It seems the Construct was not expecting No. 21 to apologize first. He is stunned for a moment, then shakes his head.																						
57	57		301								Construct	No... I should be the one to apologize. You brought back the nameplate. That really means a lot to me.	2																					
58	58		301								Construct	But I was devastated... I'm sorry I was so rude to you.	2

66	66		302								(...Why'd he have to say that!)	67																						
67	67		301								Construct	It must be hard not being able to control your expressions. Even though it might not affect you in battle, don't forget to stop by the Construct maintenance room to get it looked at...	2

128	128		301								No. 21	Is this feeling, "happiness"?	1
