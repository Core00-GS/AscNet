4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Kamui	Hmm...?	1																					
5	5		301								Kamui	Commandant?	1																					
6	6		302								How do you know it's me?	7																						
7	7		301								Kamui	I've long remembered the sound of your footsteps! Of course I know it's you.	1																					
8	8		302								Always with your jokes. How are you doing?	9																						
9	9		301								Kamui	Much better, thanks to all of you. Check this out—	1																					
10	10		204							1																								
11	11		301								Kamui	HEE—HA—HO—	1																					
12	12		204							1	2																							
13	13		301								Kamui	Good as new!	1																					
14	14		302								You do look like your usual lively self.	15																						
15	15		204							1	1																							
16	16		301								Kamui	Hehe, didn't I tell you the almighty Kamui will be back in no time? See, I wasn't lying!	1																					
17	17		302								Are you sure you're fine?	18																						
18	18		301								Kamui	Absolutely! You can check the data on the Maintenance Chamber if you want.	1																					
19	19		301								Kamui	I'll never lie to you.	1																					
20	20		301								Kamui	—You're Commandant, after all.	1																					
21	21		301								Kamui	By the way, are you here by yourself, Commandant?	1																					
22	22		302								That's right.	23	Why?	24																				
23	23	25	301								Kamui	That's great!	1																					
24	24		301								Kamui	Nothing. It's just that...	1																					
25	25		301								Kamui	There's something important I want to tell you.	1																					
26	26		302								About your... body?	27	It's not... what I think it is, is it?	41																				
27	27		301								Kamui	You knew, Commandant!	1																					
28	28		302								I've known you for a while, after all.	29																						
29	29		204							1																								
30	30		301								Kamui	So, what would you do if it was you, Commandant?	1																					
31	31		301				DialogDisable				Kamui	...If there was another you in the world.	1																					
32	32		302								It... must be confusing, isn't it?	33																						
33	33		302								Because each life is unique.	34																						
34	34		301			DialogEnable					Kamui	Even for Construct?	1																					
35	35		302								Even for Construct.	36	To me, you're all unique individuals. You're all alive.	36																				
36	36		301				DialogDisable				Kamui	Is that why it'd confuse you, Commandant? Because you wouldn't be unique anymore?	1																					
37	37		302								That's right.	38																						
38	38		302								But I'm sure I would want to talk to the other me eventually.	39																						
39	39		204							1	1																							
40	40	85	301			DialogEnable					Kamui	Is that so... Thank you, Commandant.	1																					
41	41		301								Kamui	Huh? Do you know what I want to say already?	1																					
42	42		302								Not really.	43																						
43	43		301								Kamui	Ah! You lied!	1																					
44	44		301								Kamui	And here I thought you already got me all figured out.	1																					
45	45		302								Someday, perhaps.	46																						
46	46		301								Kamui	Oh? Does that mean you want to know more about me, Commandant?	1																					
47	47		302								It'd help us work together better, for sure.	48																						
48	48		301								Kamui	Hahaha! I was just kidding. You really don't stop thinking about tactics and plans.	1																					
49	49		302								So, what was it that you were trying to say?	50																						
50	50		301								Kamui	You know... Just something impractical. The future.	1																					
51	51		301								Kamui	See, we're fighting because we want to reclaim Earth, right?	1																					
52	52		302								Right.	53																						
53	53		204							1	1																							
54	54		301								Kamui	Then, say, if that day does arrive...	1																					
55	55		301								Kamui	How will our lives change?	1																					
56	56		302								Um... You've got me stumped.	57																						
57	57		301								Kamui	Have you not thought about it, Commandant? Once the war is over, we won't have these packed schedules and daily routines anymore.	1																					
58	58		204							1	1																							
59	59		301								Kamui	We'll have so much free time to do what we want to do, to go where we want to go.	1																					
60	60		301								Kamui	What will you want to do, Commandant?	1																					
61	61		301								Kamui	I really care about this. I want to know.	1																					
62	62		302								Are you feeling lost?	63																						
63	63		204							1																								
64	64		301								Kamui	...I am. I knew I couldn't fool you.	1																					
65	65		301								Kamui	We were made only to take back the home of humans.	1																					
66	66		301								Kamui	And when we do, we will no longer have any purpose...	1																					
67	67		302								(Scratch your head)	68																						
68	68		204							1	1																							
69	69		301								Kamui	What?	1																					
70	70		302								I didn't think you would ask something so... sentimental.	71																						
71	71		301								Kamui	That doesn't sound like me, does it? Maybe I've spent too much time with you, Commandant, and I care about more things now.	1																					
72	72		302								That's good. That means your M.I.N.D. is getting more stable.	73																						
73	73		301								Kamui	Hehe, I feel like I've just been babbling nonstop. I hope you don't mind, Commandant.	1																					
74	74		302								I don't mind.	75																						
75	75		301								Kamui	See? I knew it. You're the best!	1																					
76	76		302								About your question.	77																						
77	77		301				DialogDisable				Kamui	Huh?	1																					
78	78		302								I don't know the answer now, that's true.	79																						
79	79		302								But I'll be searching for it. With you.	80																						
80	80		301			DialogEnable					Kamui	Then that's a promise!	1																					
81	81		302								That's a promise.	82																						
82	82		204							1	2																							
83	83		301								Kamui	(Chuckles)	1																					
84	84		204							1	1																							
85	85		301								Kamui	Commandant...	1																					
86	86		301								Kamui	I might be part of the Strike Hawks...	1																					
87	87		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Kamui	But I won't stop fighting for that future of yours.	1
