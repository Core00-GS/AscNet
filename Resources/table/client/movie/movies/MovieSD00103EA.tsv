20	20		301								Liv	Is it mechanical debris from the nearby factory? It might be corrupted by the Punishing Virus! Commandant, get behind me!	1																					
21	21		301								Liv	It might look like snow, but my scanner indicates that it's mechanical debris. There doesn't appear to be anything wrong with the ID system either.	1

25	25		302								Calm down, Liv.	26	Run a scan on the Punishing concentration.	26																				
26	26		301								Liv	Huh? Let me see... My analysis indicates that there's... no Punishing Virus... What is this...?	1

32	32		301									Liv still looks confused. Maybe she doesn't know what is happening.																						
33	33		301									However, by the look of her raised eyebrows, you can tell how elated she really is.																						
34	34		301									After a brief moment, she realizes that this was not caused by the horrific Punishing Virus, and lowers her guard temporarily—																						
35	35		301									She sets down her bags and becomes completely immersed in the scenery before you, showing a rare smile.																						
36	36		301									At that moment, she's no longer the Liv you know. She's no longer the girl with a past full of regrets.																						
37	37		301									Even though this moment is trivial... Even though they will soon continue to fight for the wishes of mankind...																						
38	38		301									This is enough. This is what they needed—

46	46		301								Lucia	I still don't know where Nanami is. Things aren't looking good.	1
