3	3		301			DialogEnable						In the morning, over a dozen Kurono troops dressed in new uniforms line up outside of their tents—troops recently reborn as Constructs. A new spark for humanity's future.																						
4	4		301									A few weeks after Luna's corruption and Collins' arrival, the Kurono Research Lab has had a series of successful experiments, even transforming a number of Collin's troops into Constructs.																						
5	5		301									Their hearts are filled with trepidation. After all, they are merely children at this point, having no idea what the ramifications of being a Construct are.																						
6	6		301									Unlike the stiff recruits, Collins is sitting casually on a rock, filled with indifference.																						
7	7		201							1	500258																							
8	8		301							1	Collins	Good morning, children. Starting today, I shall be in charge of your field training.	1																					
9	9		301								Collins	Where is the applause? Nikola, dear boy, how did you raise them?	1																					
10	10		201							1	500012																							
11	11		301							1	Nikola	...	1																					
12	12		202							1					1																			
13	13		301									Nikola closes his eyes, reluctant to answer him.																						
14	14		201							1	500258	14																						
15	15		301							1	Collins	Come on, don't leave me hanging.	1																					
16	16		301									The soldiers exchange glances, then gradually join in applause. A few soldiers laughed, thinking Collins is joking, while another girl with an annoyed look refrains from clapping.																						
17	17		201							1	500256	3																						
18	18		301							1	Girl Construct	Hmph... What's so great about an ol' geezer like you?	1																					
19	19		202							1					1																			
20	20		301									Rather than getting angry, Collins laughs.																						
21	21		201							1	500258																							
22	22		301							1	Collins	Hahaha! You're right, Letty girl. There's nothing great about this ol' geezer.	1																					
23	23		202							1					1																			
24	24		301									Letty is taken aback hearing him say her name so casually.																						
25	25		201							1	500256	5																						
26	26		301							1	Letty	How... how do you know my name?	1																					
27	27		301									Collins ignores her and stands up from the rock, addressing all of the new recruits.																						
28	28		201							1	500258																							
29	29		301							1	Collins	I don't know what Nikola has told you, but no matter who you were yesterday, whether you were suckling a pacifier or wearing diapers, from today onward you are no longer the protected. You aren't even human anymore...	1																					
30	30		301									Collins grins as he paces among the recruit, looking at the expression on each of their faces.																						
31	31		301								Collins	You will be fighting against monsters... as monsters!	1																					
32	32		301									Collins continues to smile facetiously, but none of the recruits dare to smile.																						
33	33		301								Collins	Of course, whether it be humans or monsters, there is trash and then there are the elites.	1																					
34	34		301									Collins stops in front of Letty, intentionally or not, and stares at her firmly.																						
35	35		301								Collins	Elite monsters are capable of entering Babylonia. Whereas trash will be thrown in the dump.	1																					
36	36		201							1	500256	19																						
37	37		301							1	Letty	Hey... Geezer... What are you gettin' at!	1																					
38	38		201							1	500258																							
39	39		301							1	Collins	Starting today, I will re-evaluate your combat ability and Inver-Device affinity. If you don't make the cut, you'll be discarded. No one's going to be wiping your asses anymore.	1																					
40	40		301								Collins	No hand-holding, no comfort from Mommy, but discarded! You'll be thrown into the toilet and flushed—VOILA! Got it?	1																					
41	41		201							1	500058																							
42	42		301							1	Researcher	But even if they lack combat ability, they are still invaluable in battle. We should...	1																					
43	43		201							1	500258																							
44	44		301							1	Collins	Soldiers that are useless in training are also useless on the battlefield. The weak will only fill the battlefield with more Corrupted.	1																					
45	45		301									Collins cocks his head at the researcher in surprise, as if he's a freak of nature.																						
46	46		204							1	5																							
47	47		301								Collins	Who will be responsible for sending them to their goddamn graves then? Me or you?	1																					
48	48		202							1					1																			
49	49		301									The researcher musters up a retort but is stopped by Nikola.																						
50	50		301									A soldier charges through the crowd toward Collins—Letty, the girl from before.																						
51	51		201							1	500256	5																						
52	52		301							1	Letty	You've got to be joking! I only risked my life to do this godforsaken surgery so I could go to Babylonia!	1																					
53	53		301								Letty	I don't wanna stay in this hellhole to be trained and tested... Send me to Babylonia, NOW!	1																					
54	54		202							1					1																			
55	55		301									Collins smiles as he waits for her to finish and nods.																						
56	56		201							1	500258																							
57	57		301							1	Collins	You're right. This is indeed a hellhole. And this ol' geezer doesn't want to waste his time playing games with you.	1																					
58	58		301								Collins	You know, I don't have a problem with loudmouths such as you, but you'd better not be all bark and no bite. Otherwise...	1																					
59	59		204							1	5																							
60	60		301								Collins	...You're nothing but a silly little lapdog.	1																					
61	61		202							1					1																			
62	62		301									Letty's face flushes with anger as she throws a punch at Collins.																						
63	63		301									Collins dodges the punch with surprising agility and grabs her by the wrist with ease.																						
64	64		201							1	500256	5																						
65	65		301			PanelActor1Shake				1	Letty	Let me go!	1																					
66	66		301									Letty tries to shake her wrist free. Theoretically speaking, her strength as a Construct should have made it easy for her to overpower Collins.																						
67	67		202							1					1																			
68	68		401							2	1512																							
69	69		301									But right as she exerts herself, Collins lets go, causing her to lose balance as she is still unaccustomed to her newfound strength. Collins then swipes across her leg with a kick, and she falls to the ground.																						
70	70		201							1	500256	5																						
71	71		301							1	Letty	I'm gonna kill you!	1																					
72	72		301									She tries to rally another attack, only to be met with Collin's gun pointing at her chest.																						
73	73		201							1	500258																							
74	74		301							1	Collins	Like I said, I don't have anything against loudmouths like you. But if you want to talk big, win approval, or even kill me—you should at least put your money where your mouth is...	1																					
75	75		301									Collins reaches a hand into his sleeve, pulls out a pocket knife and throws it toward Letty.																						
76	76		301								Collins	Not only are you weak and stupid, but more importantly, you don't want even a shred of discipline.	1																					
77	77		301									Collins takes out a comically small notebook and reads from his notes.																						
78	78		301								Collins	According to reports, you often abstain from training. Well, where on earth do you go?	1																					
79	79		201							1	500256	5																						
80	80		301							1	Letty	H-how would I rremember?!	1																					
81	81		201							1	500258																							
82	82		301							1	Collins	Great, looks like your memory isn't much of anything either... No worries, I'll help you refresh it.	1																					
83	83		301									Collins turns a page and acts surprised.																						
84	84		301								Collins	During the many times you've skipped out on training, you've either gone rummaging through the remains of casualties or breaking into civilian settlements to steal their property. Is that right?	1																					
85	85		202							1					1																			
86	86		301									Rather than denying it, Letty appears to even be a little proud.																						
87	87		201							1	500256																							
88	88		301							1	Letty	So what? I'm protecting them with my life. What's wrong with taking a little off the top!	1																					
89	89		203							1	0.25	400																						
90	90		201							2	500258		-400																					
91	91		301							1	Collins	Constructs have no use for remuneration... You did it entirely out of greed and stupidity. You've always been quite the rotten apple.	2																					
92	92		301									Collins disengages the gun's safety and points it back at Letty.																						
93	93		204							1	19																							
94	94		301								Letty	Hey, hey... Geezer, you aren't really going to shoot me... Are you?	1																					
95	95		301								Collins	As a monster, you're nothing but trash. As a human, you're nothing but vermin. What other value does your life have?	2																					
96	96		301									Collin smiles and waves at Letty.																						
97	97		301								Collins	Bye!	2																					
98	98		202							1	2				1																			
99	99		401							1	1510																							
100	100		301									After several gunshots, silence falls upon the training ground.																						
101	101		201							1	500258	2																						
102	102		301							1	Collins	Ugh... Another waste of my bullets, damn it. So, Nikola, my dear boy, turns out these scavengers and thugs lack character and conscience. You people are just wasting your time with these kids.	1																					
103	103		202							1					1																			
104	104		301									Nikola looks at Letty with a blank face.																						
105	105		201							1	500012																							
106	106		301							1	Nikola	It's normal to do anything to survive. Plenty of these people have the potential to become elite soldiers.	1																					
107	107		301									Nikola once again thinks about the two sisters who have become Constructs... He always has a hunch that if they can "survive" together, they have the potential to become the so-called... spark that guards humanity's last hope.																						
108	108		202							1					1																			
109	109		301									Collins rubs his chin noncommittally but seems to lose interest in an instant.																						
110	110		201							1	500258																							
111	111		301							1	Collins	Perhaps, dear boy. Looking at it that way, there might just be a diamond in the rough. Report to me if you find one, and I shall recommend them for a promotion. As for the trash...	1																					
112	112		301									As Collins glances at Letty on the ground, the operation leader off to the side immediately stands at attention.																						
113	113		201							1	500028																							
114	114		301							1	Operation Leader	Sir, I'll take the "trash" to the disposal plant.	1																					
115	115		201							1	500258	7																						
116	116		301							1	Collins	This guy... when did he become so smart? Honestly, it's repulsive.	1																					
117	117		201							1	500012																							
118	118		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Nikola	...	1
