9	7		301								Camu	【kuroname】, you take this one.	1																					
10	8		301									I thought Camu would put this artifact in his bag, but he only carefully examined it and tossed it to me.																						
11	2002		302								Aren't you going to take it?	9	I don't think it's safe in my hands. Are you sure?	10																				
12	9	11	301								Camu	I already have a piece. I need you to hold this one.	1

19	13		301							1	Vera	No need to ask, Karenina. It was an earthquake indeed.	2																					
20	14		301								Karenina	Hey, Gray Raven. Lucia said they were going to search for Liv down there, didn't she? Could this have anything to do with them...	1																					
21	2006		302								Lucia's team is in danger.	15	It could just be a normal earthquake.	16																				
22	15	17	301								Karenina	Let's go check them out!	1																					
23	16	17	301								Karenina	Are you dumb? No way that was normal! Let's go down and check what happened!	1																					
24	17		301								Vera	【kuroname】 can go alone. Your strength is needed elsewhere, Karenina.	2																					
25	18		301								Karenina	Vera?	1																					
26	19		301								Vera	...Don't you understand? It's the King. He was hiding his power so we could collect the artifact for him.	2																					
27	20		301								Vera	We agreed, so nothing happened to us. But Lucia must have rejected. I'm sure she even said things like "I'll stop your evil plan".	2

32	22		301							1	Camu	What can you possibly do? We can't kill an enemy without HP bar in this game.	3																					
33	23		301								Camu	...Plus, he's the King. It will be impossible to kill him unless some special mechanism is triggered.	3																					
34	24		301								Vera	Before we entered the game, Kamui also said players could not kill important NPCs...	2																					
35	25		301								Vera	The right option is to just let the King beat them, so victory will be ours.	2																					
36	26		301								Karenina	Do you still care so much?	1																					
37	27		301								Vera	Didn't you also play this game because you wanted to win?	2																					
38	28		301								Camu	Vera, we're running out of time.	3
