44	44		301								Teddy	If we build it according to your design and have the engine runs at maximum capacity at all time, the smallest error during assembly will result in a hole on Babylonia, one as big as your head.	2

58	58		301								Teddy	It's one thing that it costs a lot of money... What's worse is that it costs three times more power than the engines on our current transport crafts to run.	2																					
59	59		301								Teddy	Don't these transport crafts need to return after they land on the surface? Not to mention that Babylonia can't supply us with additional energy for the extra trips back and forth to Earth outside what they usually do.	2																					
60	61		301								Karenina	Tch... If only we have time to optimize the power consumption...	1

114	114		301							1	Hassen	I'll explain. The Science Council has successfully developed a prototype for the Omega Weapon, but that is the most they can do. To produce it, we need to employ a zero-point reactor.	1																					
115	115		301								Hassen	And the only functional zero-point reactor we possess...	1

124	124		301								Karenina	So now you're knocking on our door. What a plan.	2																					
125	125		301									Collins grins and sits on a random machine tool, unconcerned with the dust and oil stains.

129	129		301								Collins	How about this bull****... I mean, let me put it another way: do you think it's a good idea to ask some random team instead of the Engineering Force to restart a zero-point reactor?	1																					
130	130		301									Karenina is certain that there is no one in Babylonia, not even someone from the Science Council, who is more experienced than her in the field for this job. She is confident and proud of that fact.																						
131	131		301								Karenina	That's not persuasion, creep. That's a threat...	2																					
132	132		301									Karenina stays silent for once before turning toward Hassen.
