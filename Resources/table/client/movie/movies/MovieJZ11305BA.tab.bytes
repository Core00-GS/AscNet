19	18		301							1	Familiar Construct	Wait! Boss, just forget it... I was sent to the detention room last time because of this. We don't want the people up there to get upset at us again.	2																					
20	19		301							1	Construct Leader	Tch. Fine.	1																					
21	20		301									The leader gently moves Vera's knife out of the way and lets his members help him up.																						
22	21		301							1	Construct Leader	This unexpected situation in our squad aside...	1																					
23	22		201							2	500182	4	400																					
24	23		301							1	Construct Leader	Our mission objective is to retreat safely from this city. Do what you can, everyone.	1																					
25	24		301							1	Vera	We're not defending the city but retreating from it? What about the civilians living here?	2																					
26	25		301							1	Construct Leader	Due to all the sudden occurrences, we do not have sufficient time nor manpower for evacuations.	1																					
27	26		301							1	Vera	Take everything we need and abandon the people... Is that what the orders are?	2																					
28	27		201							1	500019		-400																					
29	28		301							1	Familiar Construct	...Yes.	1																					
30	29		301							1	Vera	What are they even thinking? There are at least thousands of civilians here not yet evacuated. Besides, we have defense facilities here at the ready. If we employ them well‚Äî	2

32	31		301							1	Construct Leader	Even if we do that, this place is gone for good!	1																					
33	32		301								Vera	This location is an important hub. If we abandon this place, we'll be abandoning all the connected battlefronts and losing ground.	2																					
34	33		301									Vera suddenly remembers the info she heard from the first squad she was in: the combat headquarters will be moving to outer space.																						
35	34		301								Vera	They probably want all the resources here because... they need them for certain preparations...	2																					
36	35		301								Construct Leader	I'm not sure where you got the info, but that's basically what the headquarters wants.	1																					
37	36		301								Vera	So those who are left behind... those who can't evacuate...	2																					
38	37		301								Construct Leader	...Will all be sacrificed.	1																					
39	38		201							1	500019		-400																					
40	39		301								Vera	...If we could guide most of the Corrupted to a certain spot... we'd be able to buy some more time so that more can be evacuated.	2																					
41	40		301							1	Familiar Construct	Hey, wait!	1																					
42	41		301									After a brief pause, Vera turns around and hastens to the door. The Construct whom she got into a fight with grabs her by the arm.																						
43	42		301								Familiar Construct	You're seeking death by doing this!	1																					
44	43		301								Vera	I'm doing this to end my pain.	2
