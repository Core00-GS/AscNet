4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Nikola	How's it going...?	1																					
5	5		301									The Kurono researcher briefly salutes Nikola as he enters the research lab before shifting his gaze intensely back at the modification bay separated by a pane of glass.																						
6	6		201							1	500058																							
7	7		301							1	Researcher	Looks like everything is going surprisingly smoothly. The orphans have already completed body modifications.	1																					
8	8		202							1					1																			
9	9		301									Nikola nods as the corners of his tightly pursed lips seem to relax ever so faintly.																						
10	10		201							1	500197																							
11	11		301							1	Human Soldier	Hmph... Even if the modification is successful, are these kids really suitable for combat?	1																					
12	12		201							1	500058																							
13	13		301							1	Researcher	We have no other choice. They will serve as test subjects for Tantalum-193 affinity. Most of our data has been collected from orphans like them...	1																					
14	14		201							1	500012																							
15	15		301							1	Nikola	How long until modification is complete?	1																					
16	16		201							1	500058																							
17	17		301							1	Researcher	Um... Well, all that's left now is to install the Inver-Device...	1																					
18	18		202							1					1																			
19	19		301									The Inver-Device serves as the Constructs' vital defense against the Punishing Virus. It helps stabilize their M.I.N.D. and resist corruption.																						
20	20		301									This is humanity's only glimmer of hope in the fight against the Corrupted.																						
21	21		201							1	500058																							
22	22		301							1	Researcher	Experiments 0215 to 0220... Inver-Device installation complete. Uploading memory...	1																					
23	23		301									A deafening silence falls upon the research lab as everyone nervously awaits the final results. This is the closest they have ever come to success.																						
24	24		301								Researcher	Upload complete! Upload complete! Memory stable... Preparing resuscitation!	1																					
25	25		301									The researcher eagerly issues the report, but the others stifle their cheers. If it had not been for Nikola's presence, they would have jumped for joy.																						
26	26		201							1	500012																							
27	27		301				DialogDisable			1	Nikola	Alright, carry on... This time we can finally...	1

31	31		301			DialogEnable						Without warning, an ear-piercing alarm erases the hard-earned smiles off their faces.																						
32	32		301									Even though all of the children should have still been under the effects of anesthesia, a feeble body on the operating table curls up in agony and lets out a blood-curdling scream.																						
33	33		201							1	500272																							
34	34		301							1	White-haired Girl	Aaaargh!!!	1																					
35	35		201							1	500012																							
36	36		301							1	Nikola	Hey! Get away from her!	1																					
37	37		202							1					1																			
38	38		301									Nikola is the first to react, but he is too late. The girl bursts out from the incubator and sends a nearby bewildered researcher flying into the wall.																						
39	39		201							1	500058																							
40	40		301							1	Researcher	Corruption... critical... and rising!	1																					
41	41		301									Everyone can tell that the little girl has already become a Corrupted.

44	44		301							1	Nikola	...Was she corrupted by the Punishing Virus?	2																					
45	45		301								Researcher	Impossible! The CPF is operational, not to mention the multiple Iso-Devices in the operating room. How can...	1																					
46	46		301								Nikola	Impossible? How dare you have the audacity to say such a thing in the face of that?	2																					
47	47		301									Humanity has the faintest idea about the Punishing Virus... and the intel available is no doubt partially hidden, intentionally or not.																						
48	48		301								Researcher	Sir... What should we...	1																					
49	49		301									Nikola looks at the little girl struggling from the effects of Punishing Virus—her name is Luna, the younger of two sisters who just so happen to come to the foundation.																						
50	50		202							1	2				1																			
51	51		201							1	500254	19																						
52	52		301							1	Luna	Argh... S-sis... Ahhh!	1																					
53	53		202							1					1																			
54	54		301									With such a high failure rate, Nikola never bothers to remember their names. But for some reason, the sisters have left an impression on him.																						
55	55		201							1	500012																							
56	56		301							1	Nikola	Take her out... before the virus spreads.	1																					
57	57		301									Bitterly, he issues the order through gritted teeth. The surrounding soldiers quietly grip their guns—perhaps out of habit, not compliance.																						
58	58		202							1					1																			
59	59		301								???	Look here, minions. Enough chit-chat and freaking out. Your business is done here. Get out of here!																						
60	60		301									The door of the research lab is kicked open as a squad of heavily-armed soldiers pour into the room. A tall middle-aged man stands in front of them, hunched over with a wretched demeanor.																						
61	61		202							1					1																			
62	62		201							1	500197																							
63	63		301							1	Human Soldier	Hey! Who do you guys think you are!	1																					
64	64		202							1					1																			
65	65		301									Nikola immediately stops the commotion, shakes his head and motions for them to comply with the order. Only once all of the soldiers have exited the premises does he speak to the man who burst into the room.																						
66	66		201							1	500012																							
67	67		301							1	Nikola	Collins... What brings you here?	1																					
68	68		203							1	0.25	-400																						
69	69		201							2	500258		400																					
70	70		301							1	Collins	These veterans have all passed the test for Tantalum-193 affinity. They are ready to undergo surgery and form a task force to fight the Corrupted.	2																					
71	71		301								Collins	I will be in charge of this squad for the time being. Consider me your superior, boy.	2																					
72	72		301									Although he hates being called "boy," he does not want to waste any more time with him.																						
73	73		301								Nikola	Sorry, I don't have time to reminisce with you, sir. We were just...	1																					
74	74		301								Collins	I know, I know. You just had an incident with the Punishing Virus. A Corrupted appeared here, did it not?	2																					
75	75		301									Collin pushes Nikola aside and saunters into the research lab, approaching the corrupted Luna.																						
76	76		202							1	2				1																			
77	77		201							1	500254	17																						
78	78		301							1	Luna	AAAAGGHHH!	1																					
79	79		301									Unable to control herself, Luna waves her slender arm and smashes it against the reinforced glass separating the operating room and the laboratory. The superhuman force of her arm cracks the multi-layered glass.																						
80	80		201							1	500012		-400																					
81	81		201							2	500258		400																					
82	82		301							1	Collins	Hmph... You see, dear boy. Isn't she a cutie? She wants to kill me with every ounce of her being. Such pure and unbridled malice.	2																					
83	83		301									Collins gently rubs the cracking reinforced glass and looks at Luna. Nikola can even see some semblance of "craving" in his eyes.																						
84	84		301								Collins	Compared with them, human beings are so much more twisted and complex... Even the act of killing requires them to find a good enough excuse.	2																					
85	85		301									Nikola pulls Collin a safe distance away from Luna and whispers—																						
86	86		301								Nikola	What the hell do you know... Collins? What is the Inver-Device? Why does it trigger the Punishing Virus?	1																					
87	87		204							2	14																							
88	88		301								Collins	Believe me, dear boy, I would love—absolutely love—to tell you everything I know. But, I'm sorry, you do not have the clearance... not yet.	2																					
89	89		204							2																								
90	90		301								Collins	Please inform your subordinates that what happened here today is strictly confidential and should not be leaked in any form. Otherwise, we will meet again... in another form.	2																					
91	91		301									Collins puts his hand on Nikola's shoulder and whispers so that only he can hear.																						
92	92		301								Collins	You and I have survived this long in Kurono because we understand what it means to "follow the rules."	2																					
93	93		301									Nikola shrugs off his hand and leaves without turning to look at him.																						
94	94		301								Nikola	I see.	1																					
95	95		301								Collins	Dear boy, don't show your teeth unless you know for a fact that your bite would kill...	2																					
96	96		301									Hearing this, Nikola relaxes his clenched fist—or rather, forces himself to.																						
97	97		202							1					1																			
98	98		203							2	0.25																							
99	99		301								Collins	Well then, goodbye for now. I'll be waiting for you to reach my level—waiting for you to open your eyes and make up your mind.	2																					
100	100		301									After confirming that Nikola and the other researchers have left the room, Collins turns and stands before the squad members once more.																						
101	101		301									Finally, Luna manages to smash through the fortified glass with her continued barrage of attacks. Shattered shards fly past Collins, who remains unflinching as he lets out a wicked grin.																						
102	102		301								Collins	Get to work. Kill the Corrupted and all the potential Corrupted.	2																					
103	103		202							2					1																			
104	104		201							1	500005																							
105	105		301							1	Operation Leader	But... Sir, the other modified children aren't showing any signs of corruption...	1																					
106	106		201							1	500258																							
107	107		301							1	Collins	Hehe, is there something faulty with your transmitters? Fine. Let me repeat myself one more time. Kill the Corrupted and all of the potential Corrupted.	1																					
108	108		301									Collins pats the leader on the shoulder, then grins.																						
109	109		301								Collins	If I have to repeat myself one more time, I'll lose my already very generous temper.	1																					
110	110		301									The leader grits his teeth, then aims his rifle at the group of teenagers dreaming about their new lives as Constructs.																						
111	111		201							1	500005																							
112	112		301							1	Operation Leader	Sorry...	1																					
113	113		202							1					1																			
114	114		301									The dense firepower smothers his words, making him inaudible. The others also join him in his apology, even though no one can bring themselves to say it out loud.																						
115	115		301									Collins gently hums among the flashing gunfire, as if reveling in an extraordinary performance. However, his smile quickly sours.																						
116	116		301									Although bathed in a storm of bullets, Luna remains standing and walks toward Collins, one step at a time.																						
117	117		201							1	500258	5																						
118	118		301							1	Collins	What are you doing... Can't you just stick to the script...	1																					
119	119		201							1	500254	17																						
120	120		301							1	Luna	Ugh... Aaargh!	1																					
121	121		301									Luna covers her head and unleashes a beastly roar, then rushes at Collins with unprecedented speed, but stops right before she can crush his throat.																						
122	122		301									Luna desperately grabs her hand in an attempt to suppress her desire to attack Collins, seemingly to Collins' dissatisfaction.																						
123	123		201							1	500258	5																						
124	124		301							1	Collins	Hey, hey, that's it?!	1																					
125	125		201							1	500005																							
126	126		301							1	???	Sir! Stay back!!!	1																					
127	127		202							1					1																			
128	128		301									A nearby soldier rushes forward, knocking Luna to the ground with his gunstock, steps on her, and unloads his magazine into her limbs.																						
129	129		301									He empties his magazine and pulls out his pistol to aim it between her eyes, only to discover that Luna begins to weep.																						
130	130		201							1	500254	16																						
131	131		301							1	Luna	Lucia... Sis, where are you?! I wanna go home...	1																					
132	132		201							1	500005																							
133	133		301							1	???	Corrupted... can cry?	1																					
134	134		202							1					1																			
135	135		301									Collins grabs the pistol from the dumbfounded soldier and shoots Luna until the magazine is empty.																						
136	136		201							1	500258	5																						
137	137		301							1	Collins	Hey, what's your name?	1																					
138	138		203							1	0.25	400																						
139	139		201							2	500005		-400																					
140	140		301							1	Hiro	Hiro... (Clears throat) Hiro, sir!	2																					
141	141		301								Collins	Hiro, my dear boy. Regardless if they look human or not, there's nothing human about a Corrupted. Any sign of emotion might just be a trick to catch you off guard.	1																					
142	142		301								Hiro	But she was still human a few minutes ago...	2																					
143	143		301									Collins gives Hiro a swift kick in the rear.																						
144	144		301								Collins	You won't have much longer to live if you don't quit acting so gullible. Or do you want to hurry back to Mommy?	1																					
145	145		301								Hiro	Yes... sir...	2																					
146	146		202							1	2				1																			
147	147		201							1	500005																							
148	148		301							1	Operation Leader	About the Corrupted and potential Corrupted... How should we dispose of them?	1																					
149	149		201							1	500258																							
150	150		301							1	Collins	Throw them in the trash disposal facility where they belong. I'll leave the trash to you...	1																					
151	151		202							1					1																			
152	152		301								Luna	...																						
153	153		301									Collins looks at the ravaged Luna and sighs before waving at his subordinates, then walks away.																						
154	154		201							1	500258	14																						
155	155		301							1	Collins	Hmph... I'm always left to take out the trash. Can't something happen to get the blood pumping for a change?	1																					
156	156		301								Collins	Like the arrival of mankind's true savior! Or... the birth of the last destroyer of mankind! What do you have to say about that?	1																					
157	157		301									The officer nods in confusion, not knowing what his superior is going on about.																						
158	158		204							1	7																							
159	159		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Collins	Hmph... What a bore...	1
