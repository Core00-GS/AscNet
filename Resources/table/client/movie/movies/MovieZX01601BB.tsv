3	3		301			DialogEnable						From the moment of its inception, Babylonia has always followed the instruction entrusted to her by the scientists and maintained in low Earth orbit.																						
4	4		301									She was supposed to usher in a new era. Instead, she has become humanity's "Eden", a sanctuary from disaster. Like a lonely guardian, she watches over the fractured planet from orbit.

9	9		301									The alarm rings throughout the entire ship, waking up every resident of Babylonia. Everyone walks from their respective modules to the square and looks at each other in slight panic and confusion.																						
10	10		301									Despite countless evacuation drills, no one has imagined that this last bastion of humanity would ever encounter a real crisis. Most want to believe that the alarm is only the beginning of an unannounced drill.																						
11	11		301			RImgBg1Shake						However, a violent shockwave sweeps through every corner of Babylonia, shattering the last remnants of their wishful thinking.																						
12	12		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Someone starts screaming, signaling the unimaginable, and fear spreads rapidly throughout Babylonia.

29	29		301							1	Asimov	As you can see, the ship is at 10% power, and reports show four groups of gravity engines being taken over and locked in to propel in the opposite direction at maximum capacity, causing our rapid descent.	1																					
30	30		301								Asimov	While we speak, Babylonia is plummeting towards the ground at an increasing speed.	1																					
31	31		301								Asimov	The cause of this crisis is unknown. I speculated that it was from an update made to Gestalt... but I have just discovered a vulnerability in the program. I'm sure you understand the seriousness of such ramifications.	1																					
32	32		301								Asimov	I know you have many questions, but there's no time for details. So consider the following an order—	1																					
33	33		301								アシモフ	To identify and solve this problem, I need you to carry out an emergency operation. We will use the tactical environment simulation interface, Spear of F.O.S., from the Military Academy as assistance.	1																					
34	34		301								Asimov	The way this works, Gray Raven, is that you will "infiltrate" Gestalt.	1																					
35	35		302								Care to explain?	36	Seems like an act of desperation!	36																				
36	36		301								Asimov	In short, I will export your M.I.N.D.s and your commandant's consciousness as virtual programs and upload them into the Gestalt, where you will uncover the issue and resolve it.	1																					
37	37		302								You want us to enter Gestalt?	38	You want us to fix its vulnerability?	38																				
38	38		301								Asimov	This is the only solution I can think of for our current debacle. We have no other choice.	1																					
39	39		302								...	40																						
40	40		301								Asimov	I will continue to monitor your status and help you locate the vulnerability in Gestalt in real-time. But, enough talking... You'll learn more once you are in the immersion process.	1																					
41	41		301								Asimov	I'll ask one more time. Do you remember everything I just said?	1																					
42	42		302								...Yes.	43																						
43	43		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					With that, Asimov pushes you into the immersion frame behind you.

67	67		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Asimov	The synchronization rate with the virtual space has reached 100%. Is anything wrong with the Babylonia environment that you're seeing?	1																					
68	68		301								Asimov	It's just a virtual space composed of codes, visually reproduced "cognitively."	1																					
69	69		301								Asimov	Now you also exist in the virtual space in the form of a program. The way you infiltrate Gestalt is what the Science Council refers to as "immersion."	1																					
70	70		301								Asimov	In terms of the logistics of the operation, there is no difference from performing a regular mission. The only difference is the "how."	1																					
71	71		301								Asimov	As I said in the beginning, I will continue to monitor you in real-time so that Gestalt will not identify you as "junk data that needs to be removed."	1
