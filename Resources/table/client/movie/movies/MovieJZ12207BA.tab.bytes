3	3		301			DialogEnable						The Corrupted with dark wings slowly descends upon the hill. Its grotesque appearance sends shivers down Lloyd's and Yanna's spines.

5	5		301							1	Gabriel	Do you seriously think you can run away with that wounded Construct?	1																					
6	6		301									Gabriel looks unrushed, not even looking away from the book in its hand.

8	8		301							1	Lloyd	Yanna... Move behind me...	1																					
9	9		301									The female Construct's leg is wounded. Lloyd shields her behind himself and taunts Gabriel with a relaxed voice.																						
10	10		204							1	1																							
11	11		301								Lloyd	It's nice to be flying. Speaking of injuries, you are not much different.	1																					
12	12		201							1	500101																							
13	13		301							1		Gabriel finally closes the book and looks down at its own chest. The oil leak marks on its cloak are clearly visible.																						
14	14		301								Gabriel	You are indeed a commendable warrior. Not many Constructs can hurt me like this even if they put their lives on the line. Very good, but your effort is meaningless...	1																					
15	15		301									Gabriel gently tears its cloak apart, revealing the wound that is already healed under the effect of the Punishing Virus.																						
16	16		201							1	500348	4																						
17	17		301							1	Lloyd	...What a monster.	1																					
18	18		301									Lloyd squeezes out a smile. He has never heard of a Corrupted with such great power, let alone its incredible intelligence.																						
19	19		201							1	500311																							
20	20		301							1	Yanna	Lloyd... I can still fight...	1																					
21	21		301									Yanna pulls her katana out, but she can barely stand.																						
22	22		201							1	500348	1																						
23	23		301								Lloyd	Don't worry. It's just bluffing... and it's alone. I can handle this.	1																					
24	24		301									Lloyd makes a hand gesture behind his back, hinting Yanna to run to the east once he gives her the signal.																						
25	25		204							1																								
26	26		301								Lloyd	Your mission is to go back to Babylonia and report this new enemy to the HQ... Understood?	1

29	29		301							1	Gabriel	What a pity... Instead of embracing the Punishing Virus, humans would rather run.	2																					
30	30		204							1	1																							
31	31		301								Lloyd	Do you want me to befriend the virus that destroyed the world? Sorry, but my dream is to become a hero. I have no plan to be a monster like you!	1

41	41		301									Lloyd suddenly dashes forward, travelling more than ten meters within an instant. The tip of his banner spear has almost reached Gabriel's chest.	1	2																				
42	42		301								Gabriel	Not bad. But your "surprise factor" is meaningless against machines.	2

49	49		301								Lloyd	Yanna!	1																					
50	50		301									Yanna grits her teeth and runs toward the east. She will be safe as long as she can catch up with the main force...																						
51	51		301								Gabriel	...But it's too late.	2																					
52	52		202							1	2				1																			
53	53		301									Gabriel suddenly pushes Lloyd away, then hurls its sharp staff-like blade with its left hand toward Yanna, who can only close her eyes.																						
54	54		201							1	500311																							
55	55		301							1		But when she opens her eyes again, she realizes she is still alive. Lloyd managed to throw his banner spear to deflect the staff.																						
56	56		201							1	500101																							
57	57		301							1	Gabriel	I am truly shocked... by your reflex, decision, accuracy... and stupidity.	1																					
58	58		301									Gabriel exaggeratedly extends his arms, pulling the claws from Lloyd's right shoulder. Red vital fluid pours out from his mouth.																						
59	59		301									Still, he quickly jumps back at a speed that does not match his injuries and stands in front of Yanna.																						
60	60		301								Gabriel	Is this what so-called "heroes" do? Giving up your weapon and getting badly wounded, just to save a Construct that can't be of any use?	1																					
61	61		201							1	500348	1																						
62	62		301							1		Gabriel's taunt makes Lloyd laugh out loud.																						
63	63		301								Lloyd	Hah... Don't say that so early. Sometimes "surprise factor" can still work on machines, don't you think?	1

66	66		301							1		Gabriel looks back at itself and finds out three of its left wings were destroyed from their root.																						
67	67		301								Gabriel	I see. You split the weapon in two. One was used to save that Construct, the other was aiming at my wings.	1

69	69		202							1					1																			
70	70		301									Yanna runs over to hold Lloyd as he can barely stand up. She realizes how bad his wound is.																						
71	71		201							1	500311																							
72	72		301							1	Yanna	Lloyd! Why...	1																					
73	73		203							1	0.25	400

75	75		301							1	Lloyd	Listen, Yanna!	2																					
76	76		301									Lloyd interrupts her abruptly. He knows there is no time to hesitate.																						
77	77		301								Lloyd	That Corrupted can't fly now. If I can pull it off the cliff, it won't be able to catch you even if your legs can't function properly.	2																					
78	78		301								Lloyd	Now stand up and run! I will stop it for you...	2																					
79	79		301								Yanna	But... you will die.	1																					
80	80		301									Lloyd smiles as he pretends to be relaxed.																						
81	81		204							2	1																							
82	82		301								Lloyd	Don't worry... I will leave through recalling after keeping him here for some time. Trust me.	2																					
83	83		301								Yanna	Lloyd... I'm not smart, but I can tell that you are lying. The risk of recalling when facing such a powerful Corrupted cannot be predicted.	1																					
84	84		301								Lloyd	But we don't have...	2																					
85	85		301								Yanna	No... There's another option.	1																					
86	86		301									Yanna lets go of Lloyd and steps aside. She smiles.																						
87	87		301								Yanna	I'll do the recall instead... Then you can safely get out of here without me. I have faith in you!	1																					
88	88		204							2	4																							
89	89		301								Lloyd	You can't! Recalling is a...	2																					
90	90		301									Recalling is a lie. There is no redemptionâ€”but Lloyd cannot say it out. This lie is heavier than his and Yanna's lives combined.																						
91	91		301								Yanna	Alright then, Lloyd. I will see you on the battlefield.	1																					
92	92		301								Lloyd	No! Don't!	2																					
93	93		202							1	2				1																			
94	94		301									Lloyd grabs Yanna's hands, but they have already gone stiff... Her mind is forever lost with the so-called "recall" mechanism.																						
95	95		201							1	500101																							
96	96		301							1	Gabriel	Hmm? Did she choose to end her life? But it's too late. You might be able to survive if you could give up on her earlier.	1																					
97	97		301									Lloyd collapses to the ground next to Yanna. Gabriel slowly walks to him and extends its left hand. Dark-red Punishing Virus begins to gather in his palm.																						
98	98		301								Gabriel	But with your aptitude, you may become our new comrade. Come, embrace the trial of the Ascension-Network...	1																					
99	99		301									The deadly red glow intensifiesâ€”which also causes Gabriel to ignore the fact that Lloyd has secretly clenched Yanna's blade.

105	105		301			PanelActor1Shake				1		A silver flash separates Gabriel's left arm from its shoulder.	1																					
106	106		301								Gabriel	I need to change my view on you. Your strength has indeed exceeded my expectation, to the point that...	1																					
107	107		301									Gabriel looks down at Lloyd and shakes its head. As Lloyd cuts off Gabriel's left arm, his chest is also impaled by its claw.																						
108	108		301								Gabriel	It even forces me to kill you.	1																					
109	109		301									Gabriel picks up the top hat with its right hand that is soaked in red vital fluid. It gives a slight bow to Lloyd out of respect.																						
110	110		301								Gabriel	Thanks to you, I learned the word "hero" today. You had great strength of body and mind... Too bad you chose to fight for humans, instead of contributing your power to the Ascension-Network.	1																					
111	111		301								Gabriel	...Humans don't deserve "heroes."	1

121	121		301								Lloyd	And sorry to you... Commander Nikola... I can't return to Babylonia as a hero once again...	1																					
122	122		301									Lloyd takes out a notebook from his pocket and holds it tight in his arms, as if it matters more than his life.																						
123	123		301								Lloyd	Maybe one day, "Lloyd" can live in a world that no longer needs heroes or lies...	1																					
124	124		301								Lloyd	What kind of different life will he live, I wonder?	1																					
125	125		301								Lloyd	By that time, our stories no longer need to be kept secret. Maybe he will pass them down like a writer in the Golden Age...	1																					
126	126		301									The rain and wind seem to fade away as Lloyd's hand loses its grip on the notebook.																						
127	127		201							1	500349	8																						
128	128		301							1	Lloyd	Then, our efforts, as well as all those sacrifices and lies... aren't in vain.	1																					
129	129		301								Lloyd	I'm leaving everything to you...	1
