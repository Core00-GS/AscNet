40	40		301								Liv	I'd count them one at a time when I couldn't fall asleep.	1														100000518

42	42		204							1	8																							
43	43		301								Liv	And sometimes I'd end up having even more trouble sleeping because I was so focused on counting them.	1														100000519							
44	44		204							1	2																							
45	45		301								Liv	Have you ever experienced it?	1														100000520							
46	46		302								Never.	47	Yes.	49																				
47	47		301									As a kid, you never had to do anything to have a good night's sleep because you always slept quite well.																						
48	48	51	301									But as an adult, you now spend more time trying to not fall asleep than coming up with ways to help yourself sleep.																						
49	49		301									You actually did have to count to help yourself fall asleep as a kid, what with all the pent-up energy in you.																						
50	50		301									But as an adult, you now spend more time trying to not fall asleep than coming up with ways to help yourself sleep.

59	59		302								(A real big fan... with a burning passion, too.)	60

61	61		202							1					1																			
62	62		301									You try to herd the sheep somewhere elseâ€”yet judging from the fact that none of them even bats an eye, you know your efforts are proving futile.																						
63	63		301									Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like you can move forward until you've figured out a different path.																						
64	64		302								And just look at this...	65																						
65	65		301									Looking up, you see that the skies have gone from their previous white and blue to their current tangerineâ€”a telltale sign that nightfall is fast approaching.																						
66	66		201							1	500524	2																						
67	67		301							1	Liv	Should we find a place to rest for the day, Commandant?	1														100000523

79	79		301									It's the most feared predator in the dark forest, ready to prey on all souls alive.																						
80	80		301									Listenâ€”as its drool burns through the ground, having fallen from a mouth so big that it takes up over half of the monster's body.																						
81	81		301									Lookâ€”it will never let you go once it has its murderous eyes upon you.																						
82	82		301									So run. Run as far as you can...

89	89		301									To your surprise, however, the "predator" isn't some terrifying monsterâ€”rather, it's an adorable plushie.

99	99		301									Seems like it's an all-time classic.																						
100	100		301									The only difference is that a scary monster is what you usually get in these stories rather than an adorable plushie.																						
101	101		301									You approached it because it seemed harmless enoughâ€”except it put on a hostile front the moment it sensed your presence.																						
102	102		302								It wasn't scary at all, though.	103																						
103	103		301								Liv	Are you talking about the plushie just now?	1														100000525							
104	104		301									Nodding your head, you start telling Liv about all the tricks the grown-ups used to fool you around with from when you were a kid.

117	117		301							1	Liv	I think we should split up, Commandant...	1														100000527

124	124		302								We can't just keep running, though...	125																						
125	125		301									Right then, something lands on your shoulder with a squeak.

145	145		201							1	500524																							
146	146		301							1		When you open the "door" of the shelter, Liv pokes her head out from the other side. You are now hiding with Liv inside two gigantic pea pods.																						
147	147		301								Liv	How did the chipmunks find us, though?	1														100000530							
148	148		302								I... think they probably found us with the fluorescence coming off your wings.	149																						
149	149		301									You point at the chipmunks, which are now chasing fireflies.																						
150	150		301									The fluorescence might be what's catching all the monsters' eyes in the dark, but it also stands as an inviting beacon to friends.																						
151	151		301								Liv	What would you have done, though, if they had never shown up?	1														100000531							
152	152		302								I would have come up with something before we tired ourselves out.	153	I've got plan B.	153	I would have fought back.	153

458	458		301								Cinderella	Don't worry about the pea pods, though. They're safe and sound in my backyard.	1														100000702							
459	459		301								Cinderella	Do you see the peas in the soup? They seem about the right size, right?	1														100000703							
460	460		301									Rubbing the tears away from the corner of her eyes, Cinderella regains her composure.																						
461	461		301								Cinderella	Apologies. It's been such a long time since I last met anyone.	1														100000704

465	465		302								I think I'm fine.	466

467	467		302								Yes, absolutely positive.	468																						
468	468		301									Feeling fuller than ever, you say to her in your most appreciative tone.

495	495		302								But she seems to know a lot of things.	496

511	511		302								Boy, was it a real sight...	512																						
512	512		301									Instead of splashes of water, the river spits up bubblesâ€”in an amount that shrouds you completely.

525	525		302								Sure. What do you want to talk about?	526																						
526	526		301								Liv	Well... I'm curious about why you decided to go to F.O.S.															100000562							
527	527		301								Liv	It's a common choice among people from Babylonia, but it's never the only choice.															100000563							
528	528		302								I did it to pursue a dream.	529	I did it for Earth.	533	I didn't give it too much thought.	536

535	535	538	301								Liv	It's a very brave choice, though.															100000567

859	859		301								Liv	People never get lost going after seemingly far-fetched dreams.	1														100000618							
860	860		301								Liv	Because these dreams are like beacons on the shore or the stars in the skiesâ€”they guide you along the way.	1														100000619

871	871		302								That's why I came in the first place.	872																						
872	872		301								Cinderella	Even if that means putting yourself in harm's way?	1														100000804

879	879		302								We never want to see each other put in harm's way.	880																						
880	880		301									And taking the risk ourselves is probably the only choice that will ever make us feel okay.																						
881	881		302								But it's never my job to protect her or the other way around.	882																						
882	882		301									We have each other's backâ€”and it's only when we have each other's back that we'll be able to travel far down the path together.																						
883	883		301									Alone, we might struggleâ€”but together, we are strong.																						
884	884		302								Which is why if one of us ever falls...	885
