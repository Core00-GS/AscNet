6	6		301								Lucia	Yeah, we're all out of food, and it's too dangerous to go out during the day... There are the Corrupted, and the bad people...	2																					
7	7		301								Luna	But... I'm too scared to sleep here all alone...	1																					
8	8		301								Lucia	Don't worry. You'll be fine as long as you stay out of the dark.	2																					
9	9		301								Luna	Are there really monsters hiding in the dark?!	1																					
10	10		301								Lucia	You bet. There are super-duper scary monsters that'll gobble up little kids in one bite.	2																					
11	11		301								Luna	L-Lucia!	1																					
12	12		301								Lucia	What is it?	2																					
13	13		301								Luna	Can you hold my hand until I sleep? Just for tonight!	1																					
14	14		301								Lucia	...Didn't you say that last night?	2																					
15	15		301								Luna	Lucia... Please?	1																					
16	16		301								Lucia	No...	2																					
17	17		301								Luna	R-really?	1																					
18	18		301								Lucia	...	2

20	20		301								Lucia	Sigh... Fine... But you gotta promise me you'll fall asleep quick.	2

23	23		301									Holding Lucia's hand, Luna closes her eyes... With her warm grip, the lonely, dark nights become way less scary.																						
24	24		301									But no matter how long she waits, Luna never finds Lucia's hand.																						
25	25		201							1	500031	14																						
26	26		301							1	Luna	Lucia?	1																					
27	27		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Luna feels around for her sister's hand. Finally grasping it, she discovers that it is now stiff and cold as ice.

31	31		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Luna	—Lucia!	1																					
32	32		301									Waking up from the hazy dream, Luna lifts up the hand she has been holding in the dim light, only to discover that it is in fact a hand—with nothing attached.																						
33	33		301									A Corrupted hand! She has seen them wandering by the road. Lucia told her never to go near those monsters.																						
34	34		301								Luna	Ahhhhhhh!	1																					
35	35		202							1					1																			
36	36		301									Luna throws the hand away and jumps back, accidentally tripping over something else on the ground.																						
37	37		301									She can feel the agonizing pain from the wounds all over her body, but the real pain comes from a strange feeling in her mind.																						
38	38		301									A peculiar noise clamors by her ears as if trying to tell her something. But upon listening more closely, she realizes it is just her own voice.																						
39	39		201							1	500254	19																						
40	40		301							1	Luna	Where... where am I?!	1																					
41	41		301									Luna remembers that she secretly replaced her sister and went with the group of imposing men to become a "Construct".																						
42	42		301									She does not know exactly what a so-called "Construct" is, only that if she becomes one, she and her sister can go to Babylonia. There they can eat their fill and take hot showers every day.																						
43	43		301								Luna	All I remember was taking a pill the doctor gave me, then I fell asleep... After... after that...	1																					
44	44		301									Luna tries to recall what happened after she fell asleep, but her memory is all in disarray.																						
45	45		301								Luna	It's... so dark here... I-is anybody there?	1																					
46	46		301									She tries to yell out, but is only answered by her echo.																						
47	47		301								Luna	Lucia... Sis... I'm scared... Where are you...?	1																					
48	48		202							1					1																			
49	49		301									There is no warmth from a bonfire. No warmth from her sister. Only the cold, uncaring darkness.																						
50	50		301									Her eyes brim with tears at the thought of her sister. She can barely stop herself from crying out loud.																						
51	51		301									But right at that moment, a dull low roar comes from deep within the darkness. Luna clasps her mouth shut, too afraid to cry any longer.																						
52	52		201							1	500254	19																						
53	53		301							1	Luna	Is that what my sister warned me about—the monster?!	1																					
54	54		301									The low roar and abrasive sound of dragging feet draw near... Closer and closer... Step by step...																						
55	55		301								Luna	It's... it's coming this way!	1																					
56	56		301								Luna	Lucia said that monsters only hide in the dark because they're afraid of the light. If only there was any...	1																					
57	57		301									Luna looks around to see a small hill emitting a blinding red light.																						
58	58		204							1																								
59	59		301								Luna	If I can just make it over there, the monster won't come any closer!	1																					
60	60		301									She makes up her mind, and runs with all her might toward the glowing red light.																						
61	61		301									But as she approaches the red light, she finally discovers its source—																						
62	62		204							1	19																							
63	63		301								Luna	C-Corrupted...	1																					
64	64		301									The upper half of a Corrupted lies on top of a waste pile. Although severely damaged, it still retains its functionality—noticing Luna, it turns its battered head toward her.

67	67		301							1	Corrupted	Agh... Argh!	1

70	70		301							1	Luna	Lucia... Where are you...?	1																					
71	71		202							1					1																			
72	72		301									Her eyes brim with tears once more. She has seen countless people ravaged by Corrupted. Those are the monsters that lurk in the dark, waiting to devour humanity.																						
73	73		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					But to her surprise, the Corrupted does not attack her. It gradually relaxes its grip and becomes dormant once more.

75	75		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Luna	Hm...																						
76	76		301									In the dim red glow of the Corrupted, Luna finally sees what has been causing her such pain—bullet holes on her body.																						
77	77		301								Luna	Is this... me...?																						
78	78		301									Those imposing men said that she would grow a bit after her body was turned into a Construct to improve her combat ability.																						
79	79		301									But what fills her with despair now is the glowing red light coming from her wounds—the same red light as the Corrupted.

84	84		301								(Noise)	—Throw them in the trash disposal facility where they belong.																						
85	85		301									Luna stares into the eyes of the Corrupted, her vision gradually dissolves. The red light is rendered like ink until everything turned red.																						
86	86		301								Luna	I'm a Corrupted? I'm a... monster?																						
87	87		301									The voice echoing in Luna's ear gradually becomes noisy but clear as it approaches, getting so close like it is whispering.

106	106		301								Luna	Don't do anything...? Is that it?	2
