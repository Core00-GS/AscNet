4	4		301									The sky darkens, and the warm, yellow glow of the moon melts into the night sky, peeking through the gentle clouds, sprinkling bits of its glow throughout the carriages.

14	14		301							1	Lee	Anyway, we just have to wait for Babylonia to pick us up.	1																					
15	15		301								Lee	From the progress report I just received, the other teams should be wrapping up the battlefield cleanup.	1																					
16	16		302								Right. I hope it's smooth sailing from here on out.	17	I really have to get some rest after we're done here...	17

32	32		301							1	Celica	Hello, Gray Raven Commandant! This is Celica speaking. Thanks for your remarkable work this time. The folks upstairs are quite pleased with your team's efforts.	1																					
33	33		301								Celica	This wasn't an easy mission. The Heterozygote spread faster than we expected, so you've done a great job containing the damage—	1																					
34	34		302								Thanks.	35	I've got a bad feeling about this...	35																				
35	35		301								Celica	Up until 3 minutes 28 seconds ago, the Eternal Engine has had 11 of its carriages damaged, 4 of which are in critical conditions. We are expecting it to stop running in 4 days, 14 hours, and 3 minutes.	1																					
36	36		302								Guess we didn't catch them all.	37	...	37																				
37	37		301								Celica	Gray Raven Commandant.	1																					
38	38		301								Celica	After our discussion, Akdilek has decided to carry out an emergency repair. As their forces have significantly diminished from the battle, the Gray Ravens will be providing them combat and technical assistance.	1																					
39	39		301								Celica	For more details, you can talk to the person in charge.	1

45	45		301								Sophia	I'm good.	1																					
46	46		301								Sophia	I'm rested and recalibrated. Doing great. Repairing is what I'm good at.	1

65	65		301							1	Sophia	The Eternal Engine runs on the fusion engine. If the fuel rod doesn't have sufficient contact with the stabilizing plates, the fusion reactor will fail.	1

68	68		301							1	Lee	Which was why you had so many restrictions on the inspection process.	2																					
69	69		301								Sophia	The main issue is that the train's parallel stabilizers are not working properly. All lifting operations cannot proceed when it's running.	1																					
70	70		301								Lee	So, we'll have to stop the train and fix the stabilizers first.	2

79	79		301									You find a vast desert outside the windows of the speeding train. With no moon and clouds, the stars glisten before the backdrop of the inky night sky, showering the golden dunes with diamond-like reflections.
