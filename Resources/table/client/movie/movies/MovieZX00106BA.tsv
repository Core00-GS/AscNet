5	5		301			DialogEnable				1	Lee	I've never heard of a Corrupted doing pranks before. Liv, can you check its original model?	3																					
6	6		301								Liv	...Based on its shape and size, it is likely the painting model "Spray Can", also named Nozzle, from Cosmos Industries back in the middle Golden Age.	1																					
7	7		301								Liv	It was mainly used to paint large areas, but some models were used in performances, education, and artistic creations...	1																					
8	8		301								Lee	Artistic creations?	3																					
9	9		301								Lee	So that's why it's been going around "creating" and insisting that its work is "art"...	3																					
10	10		301								Liv	But can mechs really undertake artistic endeavors?	1																					
11	11		301								Lee	Even I'm not sure. In Babylonia, art made by mechs are under the strict supervision and guidance of humans.	3																					
12	12		301								Lee	If you leave them alone, then you'll get these strange drawings indecipherable to humans. Like these graffiti.	3																					
13	13		301								Liv	Mechs have always gone on well with humans in other areas, but when it comes to art...	1																					
14	14		301								Liv	Commandant, can you understand these drawings?	1																					
15	15		302							300	I understand some bits, I think...	19	Nope, I'm lost like you guys.	22

25	25		301							1	Liv	Alright...	1																					
26	26		301								Lee	Liv, now's not the time for this. Whether this paint can's been making art out of its own will or notâ€”	3																					
27	27		301								Lee	It has destroyed a lot of Constructs, which means it's our enemy.	3																					
28	28		301								Lee	As for its artistic mystery, I think the answer can only be found after we catch up with it.	3
