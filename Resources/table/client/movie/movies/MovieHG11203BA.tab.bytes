3	3		301							1		Right after breakfast, I see Chrome waiting outside the door.																						
4	411		201							1	500155	0																						
5	4		301							1	Chrome	...	1																					
6	5		302								Chrome.	6	Have you been waiting long?	7																				
7	6	8	301							1	Chrome	Good morning, Commandant.	1																					
8	7	8	301							1	Chrome	No, I just got here too.	1																					
9	8		302								You need something?	9																						
10	9		301							1	Chrome	Commandant, I have a favor to ask.	1																					
11	10		301							1	Chrome	It's a bit of a hassle. If you don't like it, just say no and I'll leave you alone.	1																					
12	11		302								Anything for you.	12	Let's hear it.	15																				
13	12	13	301							1	Chrome	Uh, maybe you should think about it first?	1																					
14	13	14	301							1	Chrome	I didn't even say what the favor was. You could be walking into a trap.	1																					
15	14		302								But you won't set traps for me, will you?	16	Then tell me what the favor is.	15																				
16	15	17	301							1	Chrome	Here's the thing. Kamui hopes that you and Gray Raven will join Strike Hawk in planning a play for the anniversary.	1																					
17	16	15	301							1	Chrome	Yes, but...	1																					
18	17		302								A play...?	18	Why?	18																				
19	18		301							1	Chrome	I know how you feel about this. If you don't want to do this, I totally understand.	1																					
20	19		301							1	Chrome	If you'll excuse me...	1																					
21	20		302								I didn't say no, did I?	21	You don't sound excited about my joining at all!	22																				
22	21	23	301							1	Chrome	So are you saying you're willing to help?	1																					
23	22	23	301							1	Chrome	...It's just that you're busy as it is with work, so I hate to put more on your plate.	1																					
24	23		301							1	Chrome	Although for me personally, the whole anniversary thing is a welcome diversion from work. It's also a reward I promised my team members for doing well in recent missions.	1																					
25	24		301							1	Chrome	And whether you help or not, I intend to keep my promise.	1																					
26	25		301							1	Chrome	So don't feel any pressure to say yes. This is just me asking you for a personal favor.	1																					
27	26		301							1	Chrome	...Kamui is a social butterfly, but I'm not good at organizing social activities. That's probably why he enjoys being around Gray Raven.	1																					
28	27		301							1	Chrome	Gray Raven is an amazing team. As their leader, you have a lot to teach me.	1																					
29	28		301							1	Chrome	And... as your friend, I'd like to invite you to this event.	1																					
30	29		301							1	Chrome	I want to hear your genuine answer.	1																					
31	30		301							1	Chrome	If you and your team are interested, I'll be more than happy to sign you up for the event.	1																					
32	31		302								Count me in.	412	I'll ask them.	412																				
33	412		204							1	1																							
34	32		301								Chrome	Oh yeah? That's great.	1																					
35	33		204							1	0																							
36	34		301							1	Chrome	Thank you. I owe you one.	1																					
37	35		302								I'm just glad you came to me.	36	It's alright.	36																				
38	36		301							1	Chrome	You're the only one in Babylonia I can turn to for this kind of thing.	1																					
39	37		302								I'll take that as a compliment.	38	My... pleasure?	38																				
40	38		301							1	Chrome	Please be sure to run this by the other Gray Raven members.	1																					
41	39		302								Okay.	40																						
42	40		301							1	Chrome	Let's meet this time tomorrow, shall we?	1																					
43	41		302								Sure.	42																						
44	42		301							1	Chrome	I should get going.	1																					
45	43		302								Bye.	44																						
46	44		301							1	Chrome	...	1																					
47	45		301							1	Chrome	...	1																					
48	47		302								What?	48	Anything else?	48																				
49	48		301							1	Chrome	...Commandant, you've got a... there, the right side of your collar. It's folded in on itself.	1																					
50	49		302								Oh, thank you.	50																						
51	50		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Chrome	Sorry, I'm off then.	1
