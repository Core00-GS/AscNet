17	17	19	301							1	Lucia	It's from the Support Force responsible for the conservation area.	1																					
18	18		301							1	Lucia	Yes, we were discussing what to do with the puppy.	1																					
19	19		302								Conservation area?	20																						
20	20		301								Lucia	Conservation areas are areas that we execution forces have recovered and rebuilt afterward.	1																					
21	21		301								Lucia	To put it simply, the environmental sustainability device is rebooted and an ecosystem is built.	1																					
22	22		301								Lucia	The puppy we rescued was from the conservation area.	1																					
23	23		302								They're going to come pick up the puppy?	24	Did they ask us to take care of it for a while?	25																				
24	24	27	301								Lucia	Yes, but it'll need to stay in the base for a while before they can come to pick it up.	1																					
25	25		301								Lucia	Because they are currently short-staffed, and also, the puppy is injured.	1																					
26	26		301								Lucia	So, before the Support Force can come to pick it up, we'll have to take care of it here in the base.	1
