12	11		301									Some guards, yet to be corrupted, are still holding their ground. They line up to form the city's last line of defense, gating the light wall to fend off the invaders.

16	15		301								Phecda Leader	The Kowloong Corp never backs down. You shall not pass, Ascendant!	2																					
17	16		301								Lamia	Then I'll have to pump more of the virus in you, sorry...	1																					
18	17		202							1	2																							
19	18		301									"Sorry." The heedless words leave her mouth, all while she scans for more Corrupted to modify into viral explosives.

24	23		301			RImgBg1Shake						A giant hunk of metal plunges from the sky. Too big, too heavy to be called a sword. Following and landing after the slab of metal is its owner, Kamui.

30	29		301									Though Lamia is only blathering to herself, Kamui quickly catches on to her reason of puzzlement.																						
31	30		301									Every molecule around Lamia is teeming with the Punishing Virus. Her mere presence alone would cause any approaching Construct to collapse within seconds.																						
32	31		301									But not this one in front of her. With a boisterous smirk that irritates Lamia to the core, he retrieves the sword from out of the ground, as if the virus is nothing to him.

62	58		301									Chrome's diversion has kept Lamia busy, creating an opening for a melee attack. With unthinkable speed, Kamui leaps over the Corrupted and dashes right before Lamia.																						
63	59		401							2	10006001																							
64	60		301									The air whistles as Kamui swings his greatsword, up and across. Mid-swing, he shifts and adjusts, readying to lurch for a monumental follow-up to cleave her in two—

76	71		201							1	500165	1																						
77	72		301							1	Lamia	You have no qualms about killing your infected comrades, but what about those that can still be saved?	1																					
78	73		301								Lamia	He's kinda like you, isn't he? Kamui?	1
