12	12		301								Luna	...Looks like it's exactly how you said it would be, Huaxu.	1																					
13	13		301								Luna	The Project Winter is the reason the antenna cluster is in the laboratory.	1																					
14	14		301									She transfers the name list she has just received to Huaxu.																						
15	15		301								Luna	So, with this new clue from Lamia, can you give me some information?	1																					
16	16		301								Huaxu	Checking related records>>>>>>>>Complete.																						
17	17		301								Huaxu	The relevant personnel record has been found. A search has returned the target's activity records.																						
18	18		301								Luna	Cut to the chase.	1																					
19	19		301								Huaxu	The information is consistent with the individual named Lamia. Kaplan remains active and is organizing the transfer of items to the underground laboratory.																						
20	20		301								Huaxu	Based on the contents of the seized message from the target, it is presumed that they are seeking information on other deceased individuals from an encrypted address in Babylonia.																						
21	21		301								Huaxu	These include your previously searched queries of Rand and Ann, as well as Ravenge and Hiro.																						
22	22		301								Luna	...	1

25	25		301								Luna	Yes, let them think I went to pick something up.	1

33	33		301									She lowers her head, ruminating the consequences keeping it from Alpha will bring.																						
34	34		301								Luna	Given her way of doing things, she won't let me go to the Arctic alone either... will she?	1																					
35	35		301								Luna	In that case, let her intercept the Forest Guards.	1

54	54		301									That underground laboratory is used to imprison Amberia. It is an expression of their desire and arrogance, just like the military posts.																						
55	55		301									But unlike the military posts, this debt is owed by the Arctic Route Union. When Amberia fell into a deep slumber, the area should have gone to the Forest Guards. The Ascendants need not have intervened.																						
56	56		301									And that military post was destroyed through a combined effort when Alpha broke free...																						
57	57		301									With Lamia's intervention, the plan against the Ascendants was no longer feasible and the parties ceased their cooperation.

66	66		301							1	α	I wouldn't state the obvious.	1

74	74		301								Luna	I'm only interested in uprooting the disgusting things that I hate.	1

85	85		202							1					1																			
86	86		301									Alpha opens her eyes, deciding to do a sweep of the greenhouse just to be sure before leaving.																						
87	87		301									Since the emergence of the noise, she is often pulled into her memories.																						
88	88		301									The voices seem to be trying to evoke a certain emotion by blazing through her M.I.N.D.																						
89	89		301									Just as she is about to head to the greenhouse, she sees Cinderelik walking over, hugging the remnants of a familiar mechanoid.

104	104		301							1	α	It's that commandant. The Gray Ravens are here too?	1																					
105	105		202							1					1																			
106	106		301									The Gray Ravens aren't currently the main target, so Alpha sees no need to clash with them. Instead, she flattens herself against the wall and hides a distance away in the shadows.																						
107	107		201							1	500066																							
108	108		301							1	???	Well, now you have the chance to ask and find out if the commandant knows what happened to Luna.	1

110	110		301			RImgBg1Shake						While pondering the noise's suggestion, the surrounding area starts to shake violently and rocks are even falling from the ceiling.

112	112		301							1	α	An earthquake?	1																					
113	113		301								α	No, it looks like the shaking is coming from the greenhouse. Could it be Cinderelik?																						
114	114		301									She gazes in the direction of the greenhouse, remembering the behemoth "sleeping" above.																						
115	115		301									Upon sensing its presence, Alpha's M.I.N.D. receives an encrypted message from Ascnet.																						
116	116		301									It is like a whisper in her ear, speaking a language that only she understands and making clear the future it will bring.																						
117	117		301								α	If it killed the Gray Ravens, things would go back to what they were before.	1																					
118	118		301									She wants to stop them, but she senses they might be stronger than she gives them credit for. While watching, she notices a dark figure emerging.																						
119	119		301								α	...Vonnegut.	1																					
120	120		301									He seems to notice something. Before stepping into the greenhouse, he looks back at where Alpha is hiding.

129	129		301								α	Whether it's about Vonnegut or her frame, it'll all be in my favor.	1																					
130	130		301								α	The former will result in the humans' spear being pointed somewhere else, while the latter will rattle the Gray Ravens.	1																					
131	131		301								???	What do you expect them to do?	2

138	138		301								Vonnegut	Welcome! Everyone is probably worried about what my next step will be, right?																						
139	139		301								Vonnegut	To be honest, my purpose has been clear all along and that's to advance the filtering.																						
140	140		301								Vonnegut	As such, I always welcome new blood.																						
141	141		301								Vonnegut	But even if I issue you an invitation now, there will only be one answer.

146	146		301								Vonnegut	But when you are in a group, it's easy to buy into the illusion that you have a fighting chance.																						
147	147		301								Vonnegut	No matter what I say at this moment, you won't listen, so...																						
148	148		301									Vonnegut raises his index finger and thumb like a gun and takes aim at the group.																						
149	149		301								Vonnegut	Bang—!																						
150	150		301									As he makes that sound, rays of light almost invisible to the naked eye fire from behind the group.																						
151	151		201							1	500100

155	155		301								Lucia	Commandant!																						
156	156		301									Lucia senses a ray behind her but does not try to dodge it. Instead, she rushes toward you while blocking the attacks aimed at the others with her katana.

161	161		301								【kuroname】	Lucia!																						
162	162		301									She staggers back, clutching her wound. Red vital fluid leaks from her right shoulder. The wound is deep, although the internal structure is undamaged.																						
163	163		301									She raises her head and looks around. Besides herself, everyone else has more or less taken some damage from this unexpected attack.																						
164	164		301								【kuroname】	Wanshi! I'll leave it to you!																						
165	165		301									The Construct you call Wanshi hurries over to Lucia's side.																						
166	166		301								Lucia	It's okay, I can still fight.																						
167	167		301								Wanshi	...Do you want to turn off the pain module?																						
168	168		301								Lucia	There's no need to risk M.I.N.D. deviation with only this level of pain.																						
169	169		301								Vonnegut	You can try all you want, but I still have lots of tricks up my sleeve. I can keep this up until you decide to obey me.																						
170	170		301								Kamui	Are you going back on your agreement with Chrome?!																						
171	171		301								Vonnegut	No, but I only agreed not to kill you. I didn't promise anything else.																						
172	172		301								Vonnegut	Didn't the commandant over there let two flies go as well?																						
173	173		301								【kuroname】	You mean Reyna and Percy?																						
174	174		301									Vonnegut gives a noncommittal smile.																						
175	175		301								Vonnegut	It doesn't matter. I have no use for the weak. I won't even waste my time on them.																						
176	176		301								Vonnegut	But as for you...																						
177	177		301								α	...																						
178	178		301									Although she can continue watching on the sidelines, given "her" style of doing things, "she" will be handing over tactical deployment to you.
