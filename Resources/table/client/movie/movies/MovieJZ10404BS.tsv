4	4		301									An extravagant crowd gathers in the Estate's great hall, losing themselves in the fine wine and relaxing music.																						
5	5		301									Bianca stands alone by the French windows with a wine glass in hand, looking out at the faraway scenery.

14	14		301							1	Bale	No need for such formalities, I'm the one who disturbed you. Though I am surprised that you knew my name.	1																					
15	15		201							1	500128	1																						
16	16		301							1	Bianca	No one in this city wouldn't know you, Mr. Bale from the Electricity Bureau. I am Bianca and it is an honor to be talking to you.	1

23	23		202							1					1																			
24	24		301									Bale snaps his fingers and a mechanical butler walks over with two tall wine glasses filled with golden liquid.																						
25	25		201							1	500097																							
26	26		301							1	Butler	Sir, the 1790 Jules you requested.	1																					
27	27		202							1					1																			
28	28		301									Bale nods in satisfaction and takes the glasses from the butler. He glances over briefly at Bianca as he turns around, but he couldn't find the admiration he had expected to receive from Bianca.																						
29	29		201							1	500137																							
30	30		301							1	Bale	(Quietly) Tsk.	1																					
31	31		301								Bale	Miss Bianca, care for a drink?	1																					
32	32		202							1					1																			
33	33		301									He was a bit annoyed inside, but still puts on a good show and extends a glass toward Bianca with a smile.																						
34	34		301									"Bzz—"																						
35	35		301									But he is interrupted before Bianca takes the glass from him by an incoming call, rendering him slightly embarrassed.																						
36	36		201							1	500137																							
37	37		301							1	Bale	Sorry, please excuse me.	1																					
38	38		201							1	500128	1

42	42		202							1					1																			
43	43		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Clearly annoyed, Bale takes the call. Bianca smiles and curtsies once more before turning around, leaving Bale furiously yelling at the caller on the other end.

46	46		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						City 171, Prague Estate Roof - 11:57 PM																						
47	47		301									Bianca left the great hall and arrives at the roof. She takes off the small communicator device in her ear as she walks. The screen on the device shows "Unknown Caller ID".																						
48	48		201							1	500128																							
49	49		301							1	Bianca	Successfully copied Bale's identity data. Commencing hacking into City 171's power grid.	1

52	52		301									Bianca takes out a small mechanical device and quickly taps away on the screen.

54	54		301							1	Bianca	Done.	1																					
55	55		202							1					1																			
56	56		301									As soon as Bianca said that, the area around the Prague Bell Tower suddenly plunges into darkness.																						
57	57		301									She walks to the edge of the roof and pulls a weapon box out of the shadows, taking out a bow and arrow after entering the password. She focuses her attention on the blacked-out area.																						
58	58		301									In her line of sight is a Construct soldier who is currently loitering in the clock tower plaza.																						
59	59		301									The other people in the plaza are still startled by the sudden power failure to notice the Construct soldier's twisted expression and the faint red electric glow on him.																						
60	60		301									The soldier slowly takes out the service pistol from his belt and points it at the innocent civilians that he was supposed to protect.																						
61	61		301									Just as he was about to pull the trigger, an arrow flies through the air from far away.																						
62	62		301									It pierces right through the soldier's back, the force of impact sends the heavy Construct flying.																						
63	63		301									"Dong—Dong—Dong—Dong—Dong—Dong—Dong—Dong—Dong—Dong—Dong—Dong—"																						
64	64		301									The clock strikes 12. Statues of the 12 apostles appear beside the large clock as the statue of Death slowly rings the bell.																						
65	65		301									Bianca sheathes her bow, knowing that the corrupted Construct can no longer hurt the innocent.

115	115		301									As it approaches the stronghold, the door opens, followed by a few laser beams directed at the enemy camp.																						
116	116		301									Silence claimed the whole area after a few minutes. Bianca slowly strolls out of the enemy stronghold. Some cleanup staff in black pass through in between the two stunned soldiers, heading over to where Bianca is.																						
117	117		201							1	500138																							
118	118		301							1	Cleanup Staff A	Thank you for your hard work, Miss.	1

131	131		301									Bianca couldn't comprehend what he was referring to, but regains her composure after a moment of hesitation.																						
132	132		301									"Clank, clank—"																						
133	133		301									The sound of a cane knocking on the ground came from behind the three of them.																						
134	134		301								Everyone	?!																						
135	135		301									The three of them glace at each other, it is obvious that none of them noticed Wen approaching nor do they know for how long he had been standing behind them.																						
136	136		301									They hurriedly greet Wen before scattering off in different directions to continue with their work.																						
137	137		301									Bianca is halfway to the transport craft before staggering and collapsing on the ground.																						
138	138		201							1	500128	9																						
139	139		301							1	Bianca	Tsk, as expected, this frame cannot continuously be used in full power...	1

141	141		202							1					1																			
142	142		301									After having made a decision, she finds a bombarded shelter nearby to carry out adjustments to her frame.																						
143	143		301									Suddenly, hurried footsteps can be heard from afar. Bianca peeks out of the ruins to see some black figures heading for the sea carrying a cement column.																						
144	144		301									Wen follows behind casually. He slightly raises his right hand and a black figure immediately kneels on the ground to light Wen's cigarette.																						
145	145		301									Wen stands there unmoving, looking at the black figures dragging the column. He squints in displeasure, before breathing out a puff of smoke.

171	171		301								???	Found it.

173	173		301									The figure takes out a small mechanical device and pulls out a cable to connect to the storage's wall. They then taps quickly on the device.																						
174	174		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Not long after, the storage wall slides open, revealing a hidden door that is enough for one to pass. The shadow swiftly pulls out the cable and sneaks in through the door.
