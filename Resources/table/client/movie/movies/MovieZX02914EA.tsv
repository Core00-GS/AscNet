297	297		301								Noan	No, that's not the point—you were the Ascendant hiding among us all this time?	1																					
298	298		301								Lithos	Well, yeah... I was worried you couldn't control yourself or wouldn't accept me. This is the only way I can stay with you.	2																					
299	299		301								Lithos	Come back with me. Your "anomaly" has sprouted within you. I can teach you how to control its power.	2

302	302		301									Noan once again reminds himself of his lost memories—there must be a reason he refused Lithos' offer in the past so resolutely. Giving Lithos an answer now before remembering it would be reckless.

304	304		301								Noan	No. I haven't remembered everything yet. I can't tell how much of what you're saying is true.	1																					
305	305		301								Lithos	It won't do you any good to remember your past.	2																					
306	306		301								Noan	They are my memories. I'll be the judge on that.	1																					
307	307		301								Lithos	Do you really want to remember... even that time when they all hunt you down?	2																					
308	308		301								Noan	What?	1																					
309	309		301								Lithos	I've reset your memories four times now. This happened last time as well... You wouldn't accept me, and you couldn't control your Ascendant power. You became a walking target after you lost control.	2																					
310	310		301								Lithos	I had to kill them to protect you.	2

312	312		301								Noan	...What did you just say?!	1																					
313	313		301								Lithos	I said I had to kill them to protect you. But your M.I.N.D. immediately deviated after seeing their bodies... You don't remember any of this, do you?	2

315	315		301								Noan	...It doesn't matter what you say...	1

317	317		301								Noan	Yes.	1																					
318	318		301								Lithos	That was what you said last time and the time before. Your M.I.N.D. deviated both times before you could give me an answer.	2																					
319	319		301								Lithos	But that's alright. If you still insist on getting your memories back, I'll give you what you want.	2																					
320	320		301								Lithos	Come here, Shrek...	2
