3	4		301			DialogEnable						Wind blows over the vast desert, sweeping up sand and dust into a storm.																						
4	5		301									In this weather, it is as if the desert is covered by a thick layer of fog.																						
5	6		301									A cacophony of engine noises cut through the midst of the sand and dust. As the noise approaches, a white-haired girl in red bursts out of the sandstorm on a black motorcycle, leaping into the air.																						
6	7		301			RImgBg1Shake						Then the girl and the motorcycle slams heavily back on the ground, wheels sending up a shower of sparks due to the emergency braking. Prominent black tire marks trail out behind her.																						
7	8		301									The motorcycle slides to a halt in front of some building ruins. The girl takes her blade from the vehicle and walks within the wreckage.

9	10		301							1	α	This place...	1																					
10	11		301									Alpha reaches the middle and scans. The clearing is piled high with the remains of bionic animals. The ground is dotted with huge circular craters, and the surrounding buildings also show obvious traces of bombardment.																						
11	12		301								α	Internal conflict among humans...? No, they don't have the resources to spare.	1																					
12	13		301									Alpha comes to a relatively intact building and brushes the dust off the surface gently. Under the dust is a line of obscured text, revealed to the light of day once more.																						
13	14		301								α	Operation Acadia No. 5, North American launch base.	1																					
14	15		301								α	...If I'm not wrong.	1																					
15	900		202							1																								
16	16		301									Something seems to have come to Alpha. She turns to the pile of bionic remains and walks over to them.

18	18		401							2	10002001																							
19	19		301									With a flick of her wrist, the haphazardly piled remains are instantly disintegrated by her blade. They turn to pieces and scatter all over the ground, revealing an old transport craft buried underneath.																						
20	20		301									Most of the transport craft is destroyed by bombardment and the loading bay is warped beyond recognition. There is no need to wonder what happened to its passengers and cargo.																						
21	21		301									A family crest is gleaming proudly on the side of the transport craft wreckage. It looks very much eastern. The owner of the transport machine had written their name in a striking red under the family crest.																						
22	901		201							1	500100																							
23	22		301								α	Shunsuke... That's his uncle, eh... Heh. Just as I thought.	1																					
24	23		301								α	Shome... Shome. You have a gift in drumming up revenge. Too bad you chose the wrong path.	1																					
25	24		301								α	...An untameable beast is not worth raising.	1																					
26	25		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The sandstorm gradually eases and Alpha returns to her motorcycle.

28	27		401							1	102																							
29	28		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					α	First stop's this place, eh, Shome. Must be that control center over there.	1																					
30	29		301									Alpha leaves the launch base and heads for the control center. Her motorcycle eventually draws to a halt before a relatively intact building in the desert.																						
31	30		301								α	Tracks that are bright as day, huh. Looks like that scarface didn't teach him the tricks of the trade.	1																					
32	31		301									After parking her motorcycle, Alpha strolls forth to the main door of the building. She is about to enter, but suddenly pauses.																						
33	32		301								α	The walls and the door rust don't match up. Looks like this place gets frequent visits, not just from Shome.	1																					
34	33		301									Alpha circles to the side of the building. A pile of supply crates in the shade, hidden in some dry bushes, greets her eyes.																						
35	34		301								α	Food reserves for humans... Heh. And this little toy.	1																					
36	35		301									Alpha sneers and hovers her blade before her. Through the reflection on her blade, a thin, nearly transparent line can be seen hanging in the air.																						
37	36		301								α	Old military trip-mines... Looks like this place has been run over by parasites.	1																					
38	37		301								α	?																						
39	38		401							2	1504																							
40	39		202							1																								
41	40		301									Footsteps tip-tap from across the door. In one swift motion, Alpha stabs her blade into the wall and smoothly vaults over to the roof of the building.

43	42		201							2	500005		400																					
44	43		301							1	Forsaken A	How's the situation in there?	2																					
45	44		301								Zong	The Ascendant who barged in is under control.	1																					
46	45		301								Forsaken A	Why would an Ascendant pop up in this place?	2																					
47	46		301								Zong	Dunno, beats me. They're still interrogating the guy. Mr. Watanabe told us to issue a rally order to the nearby bases first. Just in case.	1																					
48	47		301								Forsaken A	Alright, then I'll go check the situation inside. The remaining members of Squadron 20-441 are also on their way here.	2																					
49	48		301								Zong	Got it... Oh yeah, did you ride this bike here, pal?	1																					
50	49		301								Forsaken A	Bike? What bike?	2																					
51	50		202							1	2																							
52	51		401							2	1512																							
53	52		301			RImgBg1Shake						As the two Forsaken begin to wonder about the motorcycle in front of the doors, Alpha leaps down from the roof and swiftly knocks the two out with the hilt of her blade.																						
54	53		201							1	500100																							
55	54		301							1	α	Now, now. Our star can't be held back by the paparazzi.	1																					
56	55		202							1																								
57	56		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Alpha sheathes her blade and walks inside the control center.

60	59		401							2	1504																							
61	60		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Countless Forsaken members stream to and fro inside the building. Alpha is lurking in the shadows, observing the situation in the main control room.																						
62	61		301									In this dimly-lit room, Watanabe is pressing a dagger firmly to Shome's neck.																						
63	62		301									Several soldiers are by Watanabe's side. The equipment they carry and the warworn armor they wear are evidences of their status.																						
64	63		301									Bexonidas. One-eyed, one-eared, one-half of his scalp left.																						
65	64		301									The backbone of the Squadron 19. A man who only gives up in death.																						
66	65		301									Halam, 16 years old. Became a new member of the Forsaken this year. The name and armor borne by her were brought back from the K-44 by Watanabe.																						
67	66		301									Watanabe thought of leaving her behind. She hit a shot from 2km away.																						
68	67		301									...Still a small lass, but unlikely to meet the same end as her father in any due time.																						
69	68		301									Clark. Old soldier, old bones. Jack-of-all-trades.																						
70	69		301									Take him with you and you can make friends with any faction.																						
71	70		201							1	1101001	5	-400																					
72	71		201							2	500184		400																					
73	72		301							1	Shome	Hey, hey, let's talk things out. Why don't we all put away the guns and knives?	2																					
74	73		301								Watanabe	We have nothing to talk about with Ascendants.	1																					
75	74		301								Shome	Ah, that makes things difficult then... And here I thought this control center is my little secret.	2																					
76	75		301								Watanabe	We know things you people wouldn't believe. Speak. What is your purpose here?	1																					
77	76		301									Watanabe presses the dagger closer to Shome's neck as he speaks.																						
78	77		301								Shome	If I say that I am only borrowing the aircraft behind this control center, will you believe me?	2																					
79	78		202							1	2				1																			
80	79		201							1	500005																							
81	80		301							1	Bexonidas	You messin' around?!	1																					
82	81		401							2	1511																							
83	82		202							1																								
84	83		301									Bexonidas quickly loads his gun after hearing Shome's answer and sticks the muzzle at his temple.																						
85	84		201							1	1101001	5	-400																					
86	85		201							2	500184		400																					
87	86		301							1	Shome	...I knew it'd turn out like this.	2																					
88	87		301								Watanabe	We don't have that much patience. Even if we don't know what your purpose is... A dead Ascendant would do us no harm.	1																					
89	88		301								Shome	Sigh... Communication never solves any problems.	2																					
90	89		301									At that, sparks of electricity appear in the air around Shome. A close look would reveal that the sparks come from a tiny spherical machine in the middle.																						
91	90		301								Watanabe	Wha... Take cover!	1																					
92	91		202							1	2																							
93	92		301									Watanabe lets go of the dagger at Shome's neck and lunges at Bexonidas.																						
94	93		401							2	10007502																							
95	94		301			RImgBg1Shake						Right after that, the electric sparks connect and violently erupts around Shome. Smoke fills the main control room.																						
96	95		201							1	1101001																							
97	96		301							1	Watanabe	Everyone, activate your goggles. Confirm each other's positions. Three to a team, and brace for combat.	1																					
98	97		201							1	500154																							
99	98		301							1	Clark	That lil' creep got away. Last security visuals say that he's headed for the airfield behind this building.	1																					
100	99		201							1	1101001	5																						
101	100		301							1	Watanabe	Go after him.	1																					
102	101		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Forsaken	Yes, sir!																						
103	102		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory26.jpg																								
104	103		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The Forsaken rush out of the building, but the fighter plane piloted by Shome has already taken off, leaving a light blue trail of flame in the air before disappearing into the sky.																						
105	104		301								Watanabe	Ride the other fighters and go after him.	1																					
106	105		301								Forsaken	Yes, sir!																						
107	106		301								???	That won't do.																						
108	107		202							1																								
109	108		301									As the Forsaken are about to board the fighter aircraft, a red figure sweeps past them.																						
110	200		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryHitNew.prefab	2																							
111	109		401							2	10002001																							
112	110		301									The red figure presents herself before the Forsaken. As she halts, all of the aircraft break down into scrap metal.																						
113	111		201							1	1101001	5	-400																					
114	112		201							2	500100		400																					
115	113		301							1	α	You may not go after him.	2																					
116	114		301								Watanabe	It's you...	1																					
117	115		301								α	Long time no see, I guess.	2																					
118	116		301								Watanabe	I'd rather never see you again.	1																					
119	117		301								α	And me, you.	2																					
120	118		301								Watanabe	Take on a different formation. She's different from the other Ascendants.	1																					
121	119		301								α	You wish to fight? Looks like you didn't learn anything in Kowloong.	2																					
122	120		301								Watanabe	Quite the opposite. We bear the past within us, which is what gives us the courage to battle.	1																					
123	121		301								Watanabe	You are not the only ones to have changed after that war.	1																					
124	122		204							2	13																							
125	123		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				α	Hah. Then show me.	2
