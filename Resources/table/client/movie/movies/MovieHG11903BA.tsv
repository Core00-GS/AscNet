3	3		301			DialogEnable						Your letters have not been especially frequent. Sometimes you get one a week, sometimes one the entire month. There have even been times when you receive a letter and forget to reply until much later. In any case, the letters between Iris and you have never stopped.																						
4	4		301									Like an hourglass, the grains of time kept slipping by, and recently, the innocent little girl has been showing greater maturity.																						
5	5		301									You have begun to grow ever closer.																						
6	6		301									Despite this, Iris has never overstepped the boundaries.																						
7	7		301									One could argue that you were close, but then again, you have never met.																						
8	8		301									One could also argue that you were not close, but then again, being pen pals, you know each other's deepest secrets.																						
9	9		301									One day, Iris started sending gifts along with her letters.																						
10	10		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					They were generally trinkets.																						
11	11		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				Our teacher at the Center of Basic Public Education took us to the greenhouse today for an observation.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
12	12		304							In a sense, it was to provide hands-on education in understanding the makeup of plants.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
13	13		304							It was my first time seeing such vibrant flowers in bloom and in that moment, all that I could think of was how true that line was—	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
14	14		304							"God expects answers for the flowers he sends us, not for the sun and the earth."	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
15	15		304							Oh yes, and among those flowers was a purple one that was exceedingly beautiful.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
16	16		304							It might have been an Iris, a flower you previously mentioned.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
17	17		304							It was my first time seeing something so beautiful.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
18	18		304							But my teacher plucked that flower and deconstructed it so that we could understand what was inside.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
19	19		304							Its remnants were scattered within the petri dish for us to observe, and looking at it, I lost my desire to learn more. I just felt lost and miserable.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
20	20		304							Although from a logical perspective, the flower had fulfilled its purpose.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
21	21		304							We had maximized the benefits gained from its existence and I suppose something good came out of it.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
22	22		304							But I feel it shouldn't have been that way. Perhaps there could have been a more fitting ending for it.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
23	23		304							Let it silently bloom and be held in appreciation by those who view it, before withering with no regrets...	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
24	24		304							The life cycle of a flower is nothing short of a miracle.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
25	25		304							But we can't spare the time to admire this miracle.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1		1																	
26	26		304							We've been educated to use the most efficient method to achieve our goal and get the results.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
27	27		304							We've lost the ability to admire beauty in our pursuit of maximum efficiency.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
28	28		304							This disheartens me.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
29	29		304							And then I started relating that to myself.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
30	30		304							My music, my opera, my art, and everything about me... doesn't seem to hold any value in this world.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
31	31		304							They won't be of help to anyone, nor will anyone take notice of them... Should I even continue doing these? I'm at a loss.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
32	32		304							What do you think? 【kuroname】.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
33	33		304							Oh yes, I begged the teacher to leave me the remnants of the flower. I took them home, dried them and put them back together to make a bookmark.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
34	34		304							I can't be sure whether I'll ever see such a beautiful flower again,	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
35	35		304				AniZhuanchangBegin			so I wedged it between the folds of the letter and I hope you'll be able to smell its lingering fragrance.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1			1																
36	36		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						There is a dried flower contained within the letter.																						
37	37		301									Even though the color has faded, the beautiful purple still remains ever vivid within its grooves.																						
38	38		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You place it on your desk, then pick up your pen to continue writing.																						
39	39		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				Iris:	ffffffff	0.5	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png		1

46	46		301			AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin		1500			After a brief while, you receive a reply.																						
47	47		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				Thank you for your letter, 【kuroname】. You don't know how much those words mean to me.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
48	48		304							You're absolutely right.	0000ffff	0.5	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
49	49		304							Just simply "wanting" will never result in anything, so I have chosen to take action.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
50	50		304							You can't make excuses for yourself to escape by simply not having a stage, an actor, or the fear of being misunderstood.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
51	51		304							I can't keep burying myself in my creative work and forget that it's more important to use them to reach out to others.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
52	52		304							Therefore, I plan to use robots to perform the opera that I wrote and reproduced.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
53	53		304							I contacted the manager of the Virtual Exhibition Hall and they agreed to provide me with an area to hold my performance.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
54	54		304							Tomorrow will be the premiere, and truth to be told, I'm feeling very nervous.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
55	55		304							I'm confident in my project, but I'm also terrified of the criticism and lack of understanding I'll get.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
56	56		304							The contradiction within my heart is tormenting me.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
57	57		304							By the time you read this, I'll probably already have performed the first show at the Exhibition Hall.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
58	58		304							【kuroname】, do you think it will be a success?	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
59	59		304							No matter whether it'll be successful, I just hope that as you read this letter, you'll pray for my success.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
60	60		304				AniZhuanchangBegin			Even though we've never met, I feel that right now, you're the person that understands me the most.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1			1

72	72		304							I don't know how to express my inner joy with you. Only at this moment, I think these words lack in tenor.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
73	73		304				AniZhuanchangBegin			I keep imagining that if you were to be standing in front of me at this moment, I would hug you and share my happiness with you.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1			1

76	76		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				I can't help but be thankful that I wasn't about to do it. Otherwise, others would consider my actions inappropriate.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
77	77		304							Not long ago, I mentioned my decision to perform my opera at the Virtual Exhibition Hall.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
78	78		304							To be honest, it got off to a terrible start. No one wanted to stop and spend time watching something like that.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
79	79		304							I was despondent, and then a girl showed up.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
80	80		304							She gave me affirmation. She said my opera was fascinating and she wanted to see what would happen next.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
81	81		304							She was an artist and even said she wanted to help provide illustrations for the scenes.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
82	82		304							My work inspired another creator to produce a new artwork.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1		1																	
83	83		304							There is no greater honor than this! I feel so happy! It's the most precious thing in the world!	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
84	84		304							From that moment on, my feelings of despondency vanished, I still felt that it's all been worth it.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
85	85		304							So what if I only have an audience of one? I'll continue creating new works and writing operas.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
86	86		304				AniZhuanchangBegin			Oh right, her name is...	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1			1																
87	87		301			AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin					This line is scratched out, forcefully.																						
88	88		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				No, I shouldn't give you her name without her permission.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
89	89		304							In any case, we've become very close friends, so let me just call her A.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1
