6	6		302								Why a theme park?	7	So, is this where we start our date?	9																				
7	7		204							1	2																							
8	8	11	301								Nanami	It doesn't count as a date if we remain at the base.	1

10	10		301								Nanami	That's right! It's our first date!	1																					
11	11		203							1	0.75	-1460																						
12	12		301									True to herself, Nanami sprints up, down, and around the amusement park with manic energy. First, to the left, knocking on a ticket machine long out of service.	1																					
13	13		203							1	1	1460																						
14	14		301									Then she runs off to the right, pulling at an ominous-looking statue...	1

23	22		301									As the statue's arm cracks and breaks, Nanami drops to the ground, still clutching the severed appendage. Luckily, for Constructs, such falls are no big deal.	1																					
24	23		201							1	1041001																							
25	24		301									She quickly picks herself up and skips her way back to you.	1																					
26	25		204							1	1																							
27	26		301							1	Nanami	Let's conduct research on humans and date at the same time!	1																					
28	27		302								What even is this "research on humans"?	28	Too close!	29																				
29	28	32	301								Nanami	Exactly what it says on the tin! I want to know everything about humans.	1																					
30	29		301									Without you noticing, Nanami comes in close enough to kiss, if either of you takes one more step.																						
31	30		204							1	2																							
32	31		301								Nanami	Too close? Relaaax, Nanami doesn't explode.	1																					
33	32		204							1	1																							
34	33		301								Nanami	In short, Nanami should take advantage of today's date to collect data on real human emotions. Don't forget to help her, Commandant!	1																					
35	34		302								How can I help?	35	I'll do my best.	36																				
36	35	37	301								Nanami	You can help by going on every single ride with Nanami!	1																					
37	36		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Nanami	Let's start our theme park date!	1

40	39		301								Nanami	First stop: the carousel! I heard that if you ride it long enough, you'll lift off!	1																					
41	40		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Nanami	Commandant, are you ready to flyyyyy...? Oh... did the flight mechanism break?	1																					
42	41		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory188.png		Hahahaha! That ghost has a funny face!																						
43	42		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Nanami	No worries, we'll be moving on to stop number two, the haunted house! But things like ghosts aren't realistic at all...	1																					
44	43		204							1	2																							
45	44		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Nanami	Hahahaha! That ghost looks funny!	1																					
46	45		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory194.png																								
47	46		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Nanami	Next stop is the roller coaster. The rail would break in the middle to make it more exciting!	1

49	48		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Nanami	Wah! We're fallinggg!!	1

52	51		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Nanami	They were all so fun even though they broke down halfway!	1																					
53	52		302								Eh, it's alright.	53	I think this is an abandoned amusement park.	55																				
54	53		204							1																								
55	54	57	301								Nanami	...Are you bored?	1																					
56	55		204							1																								
57	56		301								Nanami	Commandant just doesn't look excited. Is it boring?	1																					
58	57		301								Nanami	Hmm, looks like I do need to do more research before the date.	1																					
59	58		302								You prepared this?	59	Why don't we try collecting data another way?	61																				
60	59		204							1	1																							
61	60	64	301								Nanami	Yeah, I came early to sweep the grounds of Corrupted and then asked Lucia and the gang for help with repairs.	1																					
62	61		204							1	1																							
63	62		301								Nanami	Another way? Nah, this is the only way.	1																					
64	63		204							1	2																							
65	64		301								Nanami	A-ny-way, Nanami will not be disheartened! Look forward to our next date, Commandant!	1
