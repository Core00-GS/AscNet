5	5		301			DialogEnable				1	Celica	Here is a summary of recent reports, President Hassen.	1																					
6	6		301								Hassen	Thank you.	2																					
7	7		301								Hassen	...Just as I thought.	2																					
8	8		301								Celica	What's going on?	1																					
9	9		301								Hassen	The Corrupted are becoming more active. Is it because of the polymer materials that have fallen to Earth...? Or something else...	2

12	12		301							1	Asimov	Whatever it is, we have to deal with them.	1																					
13	100		401							2	1515																							
14	13		301									As Hassen and Celica talk, Asimov enters from the side. Extracting the map from Hassen's file, he projects it on-screen.																						
15	14		301								Asimov	Just as the Science Council predicted. The Corrupted are becoming more active, with even the tendency to congregate into makeshift armies.	1																					
16	15		301								Asimov	It used to be that they followed instinct towards the same place. Now, they seem to be massing for coordinated attacks.	1																					
17	16		201							1	500001																							
18	17		301							1	Celica	Did our operations to regain lost ground affect the Corrupted's movement patterns?	1																					
19	18		201							1	500004																							
20	19		301							1	Asimov	Maybe, maybe not. After all, Corrupted don't think like wild beasts.	1																					
21	20		201							1	500011																							
22	21		301							1	Hassen	By your being here, Asimov, I take it that your department has already come up with a solution for this situation?	1																					
23	101		401							2	1515																							
24	22		301									In answer, Asimov pulls up blueprints for a Construct module on-screen.																						
25	23		301								Hassen	What's this?	1																					
26	24		201							1	500004																							
27	25		301							1	Asimov	A Construct expansion module, named "Inver-Sync".	1																					
28	26		301								Asimov	To fight an army of Corrupted, we need an army of our own, which we realistically cannot field.	1																					
29	27		301								Asimov	That's why we must unite the few Elite-level Constructs we have, and use them to elevate our entire force.	1																					
30	28		201							1	500011																							
31	29		301							1	Hassen	So this module... can turn everyone into elite combatants?	1																					
32	30		201							1	500004																							
33	31		301							1	Asimov	Yes. Once Inver-Sync is activated, all Constructs in the area of operations can be linked, sharing each other's thoughts and connections.	1																					
34	32		301								Asimov	And achieve the "All Are One" combat doctrine.	1																					
35	33		201							1	500011																							
36	34		301							1	Hassen	...How's the module production going?	1																					
37	35		201							1	500004																							
38	36		301							1	Asimov	We can ensure a certain usable amount, but the assembly line is unstable. Babylonia has many more pressing projects, after all.	1																					
39	37		201							1	500011																							
40	38		301							1	Hassen	Is that so... But as you said, my original intent was to meet the Corrupted, pound for pound.	1																					
41	39		301								Hassen	After all, there's no way we're letting the Corrupted congregate unchecked. It would spell disaster if they were allowed to expand.	1																					
42	40		301								Hassen	Celica.	1																					
43	41		201							1	500001																							
44	42		301							1	Celica	Yes, sir. What are your orders?	1																					
45	43		201							1	500011		-400																					
46	44		201							2	500004		400																					
47	45		301							1	Hassen	Recall all units available back to Babylonia. Asimov, you will coordinate efforts to install these modules on all Class 2 combatants.	1																					
48	46		301								Asimov	Class 2... why not Class 1? Advanced Constructs would coordinate teams better.	2																					
49	47		301								Hassen	We'll hold the advanced Constructs back, in case anything unexpected happens. It'd be trouble if the commanding Construct had to face powerful Corrupted alone. Better leave this to Class 1 Constructs.	1																					
50	48		301								Asimov	...It's just as well. I'm just the one who makes the tools. How you wield them is up to you.	2																					
51	49		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Hassen	It's settled then. Broadcast the orders, Celica. It is time for Joint Warfare.	1
