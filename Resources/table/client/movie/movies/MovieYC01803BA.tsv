7	7		301							1	Lucia	Lee, you're moving too fast. The commandant and Liv don't have the same mobility as Attacker Constructs.	2																					
8	8		301								Lee	Don't overdo yourself if you can't keep up.	1																					
9	9		301								Lucia	But if you run into trouble, we won't be able to provide you with support.	2																					
10	10		301								Lee	Lucia, haven't you noticed that we're making faster progress than on previous missions?	1																					
11	11		301								Lucia	?	2																					
12	12		301								Lee	This isn't the first time the two of us Attacker Constructs are in each other's way on a mission together.	1																					
13	500		204							2	3																							
14	13		301								Lucia	Um...	2																					
15	14		301									Hearing Lucia on the comm link, Lee shows no sign of slowing down. Instead, he keeps his finger on the trigger. Lee flies among the Corrupted, leaving a trail of mechanical debris.																						
16	15		301								Lee	I'm merely stating the facts. I have no malicious intent.	1																					
17	16		301								Lee	And by the time you guys had reported in, I had already finished gathering intel on the enemy here on the streets.	1																					
18	17		301								Lee	One Attacker Construct was all it took to wipe out the Corrupted around here.	1																					
19	18		301								Lee	There's still a lot we don't know about the city. Assume echelon formation and alternate as point man. This will conserve energy consumption for each member.	1																					
20	19		301								Lucia	But...	2																					
21	20		301								Lee	No buts. You haven't thought of a better solution. Have you?	1

44	43		301							1	Lucia	Wait, I'll get you out of here.	1

51	49		201							2	500292	5	400																					
52	50		301							1	Liv	It's an EMP trap. Ground forces used these against Corrupted.	2																					
53	51		301								Liv	But they were later banned due to their inefficiency.	2																					
54	52		301								Lee	Exactly. The traps don't kill the enemy. Instead, the Corrupted can just overwhelm them with shear numbers.																						
55	53		301								Lee	Hmph. Humanities defenses are now hindering their own attack.																						
56	54		301								Lee	How foolish.																						
57	55		301								Liv	Commandant, we've overstayed our welcome. A horde of Corrupted are advancing on our position.	2																					
58	502		204							1	3																							
59	56		301									Hearing this, Lucia tightens her grip on the katana, the pain of indecision tearing at her heart.																						
60	57		301								Lee	Go on. I can handle myself.																						
61	58		301								Lee	I can't move my frame, but they won't break it so easily.																						
62	59		302								What do you think, Liv?	60																						
63	60		301								Liv	Evacuating is our best option. Minimizing losses would be more beneficial overall.	2																					
64	61		301								Liv	This is the secret to Egret's repeated victories.	2																					
65	62		302								But we're the Gray Ravens.	63																						
66	63		301								Liv	...	2																					
67	64		302								...	65																						
68	65		301								Liv	Huh? Commandant, what are you doing?	2																					
69	66		301									You pull out a tactical knife from your waistband and rope from your backpack. You fasten one end of the rope to the edge of the pit.																						
70	67		301									You tie the other end of the rope around your waist.																						
71	68		302								Doing my job.	503																						
72	503		204							1	5																							
73	69		301								Lucia	Got it.	1

79	75		301								Liv	...	2																					
80	76		301								Lee	What's the hold up? According to my calculations, Corrupted will arrive in 30 seconds.																						
81	77		301									After fixing the rope, you reach into the pit. Unlike Lucia, touching the edge has no effect on you.																						
82	78		301								Lee	...																						
83	79		302								Seems like it's ineffective against humans.	80																						
84	80		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Ensuring that there was no hindrance, you climb into the pit.

90	86		401							2	1516																							
91	87		301									Ignoring Lee's questioning, you rappel down the pit. Your army boots thud against the wall, echoing throughout the pit. A few moments later, you reach Lee lying there motionless at the bottom.

94	90		301									As you reach the bottom, you hear the clanging of a katana and buzzing electricity overhead.																						
95	91		302								Looks like they've engaged the enemy.	92																						
96	92		301									Kneeling down, you help Lee up and fasten him to your back with the rope.																						
97	93		301								Lee	Why are you being so foolish and reckless?	1																					
98	94		302								You're in no condition to help yourself.	95																						
99	95		301								Lee	Laugh it up. No need to act like you're concerned. I've seen enough as is.	1																					
100	96		302								Looks like this trap can also temporarily short-circuit Constructs.	97																						
101	97		301				DialogDisable				Lee	...	1																					
102	98		302								Good thing I was the first one into the pit and not a Corrupted.	99																						
103	99		302								Otherwise, you'd have been in trouble, Lee.	100																						
104	100		301			DialogEnable						With Lee on your back, you tug on the rope to check that it is securely fastened and begin to slowly climb your way back up.																						
105	101		301									Severed Corrupted limbs fall into the pit as they become enveloped in blue static and crash into the bottom of the pit with a heavy thud.																						
106	102		301				DialogDisable				Lee	But now everyone is in danger because of me.	1																					
107	103		302								We've already made up our minds.	104																						
108	104		302								There will always come a time when you need someone's help.	105																						
109	105		302								Just like I said earlier. You should give it a try.	106																						
110	106		301			DialogEnable					Lee	...When I get back, the first thing I'm doing is give this frame EMP resistance.	1																					
111	107		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				Alright, alright.	108

127	123		301									Hearing this, Lee can't help but touch his cheeks. He quickly turns his head to look the other way.
