10	11		301								Liv	I ran a search with information of the Ascendants and Huaxu but I wasn't able to find anything. We can really use information that's more detailed.	1																					
11	12		301								Lucia	All these projections and the Corrupted here, though. Could this be a sign of something?	3																					
12	13		301								Liv	It could be, but of what?	1																					
13	14		302								Lee, what's your thought?	15	Lucia, let's get rid of them all!	18	Liv, do you recall anything?	24																		
14	15		301								Lee	As I said, a record this huge and complicated would take quite some time to calculate.	2																					
15	16		301								Lee	The Spear of F.O.S. isn't turning up anything with the information we have. It's only giving us this sea of data.	2																					
16	17	24	301								Lee	Let's see what Liv has to say.	2

20	21		301								Lee	Hold on! But we came here for leads!	2																					
21	22		301								Lee	The record is only going to get bigger and more complicated if we destroy all the Corrupted here!	2																					
22	23	24	301								Lee	Let's see what Liv has to say.	2

25	26		301			DialogEnable					Liv	Most of these Corrupted bodies are new. The only ones with dust on them are placed high up.	1																					
26	27		301								Liv	I think these Corrupted only got here recently.	1																					
27	28		301								Lee	So, something drew them here, or maybe the Ascendants summoned them.	2																					
28	29		301								Liv	Correct, and the remains on the ground have been recycled.	1																					
29	30		301								Liv	Uhm... Why did they only recycle the ones on the ground, though?	1																					
30	31		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					The four of you think for a bit to no avail. You will just need to keep looking for clues.
