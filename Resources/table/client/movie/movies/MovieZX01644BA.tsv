4	4		301									Having gotten over her attachments and accepted her regrets, Lucia escapes the abyss before the M.I.N.D.s merge beyond the divergence point.

10	10		301								α	If not for the connection...	1																					
11	11		301									Alpha tightens her grip, focusing her energy and rage onto her blade. And yet a hint of weariness appears on her face.

16	16		301							1	α	Before your consciousness completely dissolves, our minds will be tangled like a knot, impacting each other.	2																					
17	17		301								Lucia	So the voices I heard during the quake... It was you!	1																					
18	18		301								α	What did you hear?	2

29	29		301								Lucia	Alpha, you are the one who cannot overcome her regrets.	1																					
30	30		301								α	How can I still have regrets when I've been found?	2																					
31	31		301								Lucia	Because you turned it into hate.	1																					
32	32		301								Lucia	A person who is motivated by hate is the one who can't step into the future. Now... you won't be able to block this!	1

34	34		301									A chilling glow gathers on Lucia's katana. She lifts her head, her gaze on Alpha no longer in doubt.

38	38		301									Gathering a winter storm, Lucia's strike arrives with a sky full of snow, only to find Alpha not blocking or moving away. Instead, she dives forward and embraces Lucia.																						
39	39		301									The katana pierces through Alpha's body. Although her physical form is unharmed in the M.I.N.D., her psyche still takes a heavy toll.

41	41		301							1	Lucia	What are you doing?!	1																					
42	42		301									Alpha says nothing. She clasps around Lucia's waist with one hand and grasps her neck with another one, and with Lucia in her arms, she jumps off the divergence point.																						
43	43		301								Lucia	Alpha?! You want to dive deeper?!	1
