3	3		301			DialogEnable						The princess's first wish is very simple.																						
4	4		301									The world portrayed in the illustration books and story books is very beautiful.																						
5	5		301									The world isn't a complex of palaces. Water isn't always gentle. The cycle of day and night exists even outside the little courtyard.																						
6	6		301									She wants to see them for herself.																						
7	7		301			RImgBg1Shake						So, as the dragon roars and destroys villages and towns, as the nobles cower behind the fortified walls...

13	13		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The traveler makes it past mountains and lakes to visit villages and finally arrives at the forest where the witch lives.																						
14	14		301									The princess's blessings bestowed by the adult witch have long dwindled and withered along her journey, but the light of her soul still shines brightly.

22	22		301									The champion sword that slays dragons must be refined with the blessing of the iris, the crystal of the ashes of the girl trapped in endless reincarnation, along with her singing and memories.																						
23	23		301									The witch asks three spiders about the fate of this traveler.																						
24	24		301									The spiders go stiff and die on their webs. The webs of destiny are closely intertwined and interconnected.

30	30		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Following legends and rumors, she puts to sea and looks for an unknown island where she might learn how to save the world from this calamity.																						
31	31		301									She gives hope to children, calms people with her singing voice, and imparts knowledge to adults.																						
32	32		301									Perhaps it is because of these behaviors that, while she attracts the people's attention, she also feels protected by them.																						
33	33		301									The traveler passes on her stories and singing voice to the people on the boat, and then to the people living along the shore. They will keep these stories in their mind on their journey into the future.																						
34	34		301									But Duke Prospero's powerful magic will one day lose its power. Miracles and good fortune won't always be by our side.

43	43		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The witch arrives at the island.

46	46		301									Thus, the first piper is born.
