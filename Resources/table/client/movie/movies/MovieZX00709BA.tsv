6	6		301							1	Liv	Because we don't have access authority to her M.I.N.D., we'll have to brute force it...	1																					
7	7		301								Liv	This is...!	1																					
8	8		301								Liv	A form of energy is trying to invade Karen's M.I.N.D.	1																					
9	9		301								Lucia	Energy?	2																					
10	10		301								Liv	I currently cannot discern its constituents... but this energy is overloading her M.I.N.D. and causing it to overheat.	1																					
11	11		301								Liv	If this goes on, Karen might...	1																					
12	12		302								Immediately call Celica for help!	13																						
13	13		301								Liv	Yes, Commandant... B-but Karen's situation requires immediate attention as well!	1

16	16		301							1	Bianca	What do we need to do?	2																					
17	17		301								Liv	Like I said, I cannot discern the properties of that energy. But at the very least, her M.I.N.D. must be cooled off first.	1																					
18	18		301								Liv	We need to help Karen's frame sleep to temporarily pause her M.I.N.D., then wait for support or help.	1																					
19	19		301								Liv	But the issue is that, even though I've been externally sending in sleep commands, that energy is disrupting its execution.	1																					
20	20		302								Is there no other way?																							
21	21		301								Liv	There is, but it's a risky choice.	1																					
22	22		202							2					1																			
23	23		201							2	1021001	4	-400																					
24	24		301							1	Lucia	The situation is dire. Even if it has high risk, we have no choice.	2																					
25	25		302								Liv, can you explain?	26																						
26	26		301								Liv	Rightâ€”we can force a sleep command from inside Karenina's M.I.N.D. by connecting with it.	1																					
27	27		301								Liv	Specifically, by using my operation system as a bridge to connect Karenina and someone else's M.I.N.D., we can let the two consciousnesses briefly connect.	1																					
28	28		301								Liv	That way, the other person can enter Karenina's M.I.N.D. and assist in forcing a sleep command.	1

31	31		301							1	Lee	So it'll be like injecting immunocytes into a body?	3																					
32	32		301								Liv	Yes, Lee's metaphor is quite apt. But at the same time, this requires the linking of two M.I.N.D.s, so there will be a high chance of coming into contact with that unknown energy.	1																					
33	33		301								Liv	I'm sorry... but I have no suitable countermeasures at the moment.	1																					
34	34		302								No, you've already done well, Liv.	35

36	36		201							2	1091001		-400																					
37	37		301							1	Bianca	I'll take that risk for Karen.	2

39	39		201							2	1021001	4	-400																					
40	40		301							1	Lucia	No, I should do it.	2																					
41	41		301								Lucia	Given the situation, we still have to stay here for a while, and we'll likely be attacked by more Corrupted. Whether we hold our ground or retreat, ranged attacks are more favorable than melee ones.	2																					
42	42		301								Lucia	And we have the guidance of Commandant's Mind Beacon. That should lower the risk.	2
