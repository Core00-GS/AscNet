12	12		301							1	Nikola	Corrupted have some degree of self-healing capability. Minor injuries won't prove fatal. You need to pinpoint your attacks in order to defeat them.	1

16	16		301									But the Corrupted spares no time for Lucia to catch her breath, raising its sharp claws and rushing toward her.

19	19		301									Even though Lucia raises her katana to block, the unimaginable power of the corrupted sends her flying back several steps.

23	23		301							1	Lucia	If we fall here, those behind me will be lost just like Luna.	1																					
24	24		301									Lucia regains her composure, then pushes the incoming claw of a Corrupted to one side just as it is about to slice right through her.

29	29		301									The Corrupted wants to turn around and smash its claw into the head of the Construct in front of it, only to find its upper body already separated from its lower body. Lucia's sharp blade has severed it in twain right as it passes by.

31	31		301									After killing the Corrupted, Lucia falls to her knees, unable to support herself any longer.

33	33		301							1	Nikola	(Surely enough, it's too early for Lucia to engage in actual combat. She's only just completed her transformation...)	1																					
34	34		301									Such rigorous training is actually Collins' idea. Even though he has concerns, Nikola has made no objection. He knows humanity does not have much time left. Lucia and the Constructs must at least grow up to protect themselves.

36	36		301							1	Lucia	Sir... Am I fit for combat?	1																					
37	37		301									Lucia raises her head and looks at Nikola calmly... Though her eyes are still young, they have already hardened into the eyes of a soldier.

39	39		301							1	Nikola	...You still have a lot to learn. Rest assured, all your effort has not been in vain.	1

52	52		301								"Luna"	Lucia doesn't know that those despicable humans are responsible for what happened to you. They justify their actions in a grandiose web of lies. You know their tricks well...	2

60	60		301									Blood-red light coalesces in Luna's hand only to disappear in an instant.																						
61	61		301								Luna	If I kill him now... Lucia will be more convinced by what those humans have told her. Both the nun and Lucia are caught in the web of lies carefully crafted by humanity.	1																					
62	62		301								Luna	There will come a day when Lucia will be our enemy... When the time comes, I, who bear the mission of the Ascension-Network, and Lucia, who has been deceived by mankind, will...	1

69	69		301									From the bottom of her heart, Luna knows this day will soon come.																						
70	70		301								Luna	Until she returns, I will wait quietly... as we promised.
