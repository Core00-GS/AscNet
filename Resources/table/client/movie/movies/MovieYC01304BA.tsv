8	8		301									Roland is standing beside Gabriel and looking around. The park facilities are old, but not dilapidated. Some service-type robots are aimlessly wandering around, giving the place an even lonelier air.																						
9	9		301									Unchanged for decades, this small island is gradually sinking in a corner of the Caribbean Sea, frozen in time.																						
10	10		301									At the moment of its completion, time became frozen on this enchanted isle. The observation platform, dreamily hanging in the sky, looks almost like a border between fantasy and reality.																						
11	11		301									To spend time on this island, is to know solitude. A type of loneliness that dissects oneself from the world.																						
12	12		301									The plethora of facilities planted in the various corners of the island have all become nothing but shards of the past, accumulating dust that is known as history.																						
13	13		301									Venus Splash Park stands witness to the passing of time, alone, eternal, waiting quietly for its master to return.

20	19		301							1	Luna	There is more to this water park than what meets the eye.	1																					
21	20		301									Luna's voice rings out from behind the three Ascendants. The three salute upon seeing her, to which she dismisses briefly and begins assigning their missions.																						
22	21		301								Luna	Gabriel.	1

25	24		201							1	500105																							
26	25		301							1	Luna	You will handle the energy center that is supporting the operation of the theme park. It's likely that Shome's purpose in coming here is hidden there.	1

28	27		301							1	Gabriel	Yes.	1

39	38		201							1	500105	21																						
40	39		301							1	Luna	Good. Our operation this time will definitely alert the surrounding factions, but they must not impede our plans.	1																					
41	40		301								Luna	This is the Shome's final resting place, where he will wake from his dream.	1																					
42	41		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Luna	Let his damnation, and this place's, be a wake-up call for those who do not comply.	1

48	47		301							1	Roland	Getting Shome to play out his hand here, plucking it out one by one... Miss Luna sure is a mean one.	1

50	49		301							1	Lamia	Yeah...	1																					
51	50		301								Lamia	Oh right, I think I saw an elevator over there that leads to the observation platform.	1																					
52	51		201							1	500101																							
53	52		301							1	Gabriel	Don't forget the mission.	1

55	54		301							1	Lamia	Yeah... I can control the flow of the surrounding virus when I'm up there.	1																					
56	55		201							1	500101																							
57	56		301							1	Gabriel	Then I shall take my leave. I've just finished scanning the energy center below.	1																					
58	57		301								Gabriel	It's larger than I'd expected.	1																					
59	58		201							1	500008																							
60	59		301							1	Roland	But, well, not like it'd be any trouble for you.	1																					
61	60		201							1	500101																							
62	61		301							1	Gabriel	True. We can easily modify a machine facility of this scale thanks to what we found in Kowloong. Turning it into a dead zone, as the humans call it, would only require half an hour.	1																					
63	62		201							1	500165	1																						
64	63		301							1	Lamia	...Um. Actually, on my way here, I've already raised the viral density around the island as well.	1
