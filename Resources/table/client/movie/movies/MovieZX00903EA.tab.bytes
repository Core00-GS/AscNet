22	21		201							1	500110																							
23	22		301							1	Ayla	I've been following the news.	1																					
24	23		301								Ayla	To be more specific, I've been keeping up with the news on Gray Raven, and that includes everything and everyone in their proximity.	1																					
25	24		201							1	500080																							
26	25		301							1	Watanabe	Why Gray Raven... Whatever, none of my business.	1																					
27	26		201							1	500110																							
28	27		301							1	Ayla	Oh, there's nothing I can't tell. It's really just their commandant I'm interested in. By the way...	1

34	33		301									Watanabe continues to fly the aircraft with ease while they talk.	1																					
35	34		301									After another enemy explodes into cosmic dust, Watanabe takes out a mint leaf from the cockpit and passes it to Ayla.	1

52	51		301									Watanabe and his Forsaken air force have already eliminated most Corrupted drones with superb efficiency.

54	53		301								System	Lock-on warning. Incoming attacks. Amount: 16...

67	66		201							1	500080																							
68	67		301							1	Watanabe	I've met many Babylonian squads, but only they can do that.	1																					
69	68		201							1	500110

81	80		202							1					1																			
82	81		301									It is an aircraft with no signs to indicate its faction. It lands on the surface of the space station, creating a huge opening.																						
83	82		201							1	500080																							
84	83		301							1	Watanabe	Looks like we have some uninvited guests...	1																					
85	84		301								Watanabe	The deal with Babylonia is supposed to end here...	1
