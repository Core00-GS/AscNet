9	9		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Nikola	Are you certain?	11																					
10	10		301								Bianca	We haven't investigated the lower third floor and the west wing ourselves yet, but the evidence we've collected so far is proof enough.	1																					
11	11		301								Bianca	The Ascendants have amassed a large amount of Red Tide at the reservoir on the lowest level of the aquarium through the underground waterways.	1																					
12	12		201							11	500011		-500																					
13	13		301							1	Hassen	So they never stopped trying to spread the Red Tide to the ocean.	11																					
14	14		201							11	500012		-500			1																		
15	15		301							1	Nikola	Hmph. So they've been spreading those rumors to draw our attention away from this. Sending the Red Tide to the ocean through the waterways otherwise would be ineffective and easily detected by our satellites.	11																					
16	16		301								Nikola	But we'd be powerless to stop them if they released the Red Tide after amassing a large volume, no matter how quickly we detected it afterward.	11																					
17	17		201							11	500004		-500																					
18	18		301							1	Asimov	The result of the simulation is in.	11																					
19	19		301								Asimov	I'll skip ahead to the conclusion. At maximum capacity, the amount of Red Tide they release will contaminate the entire ocean in two months.	11																					
20	20		201							11	500012		-500			1																		
21	21		301							1	Nikola	Can we hit them with the Longinus Arsenal as we did?	11																					
22	22		201							11	500004		-500																					
23	23		301							1	Asimov	I'm afraid not. The Red Tide isn't exposed on the surface this time. There are high-strength structures and a sizable volume of water above it.	11																					
24	24		301								Asimov	The Longinus Arsenal would lose most of its energy puncturing the structures above. What's left is incapable of vaporizing the water.	11																					
25	25		201							11	500011		-500																					
26	26		301							1	Hassen	They didn't transfer this volume of Red Tide in a day or two. They've been doing a great job hiding their activity from us.	11																					
27	27		301								Hassen	We're only noticing this because they were luring the Scarlet Revelation to the aquarium. Why would they do something that could expose their plan?	11																					
28	28		204							1	5																							
29	29		301								Bianca	I think... it's for an experiment.	1																					
30	30		201							11	500012		-500																					
31	31		301							1	Nikola	An experiment?	11																					
32	32		204							1																								
33	33		301								Bianca	Yes. They have seemingly discovered a way to expedite the process of evolving the Hetero-Creatures from the Red Tide.	1																					
34	34		301								Bianca	It didn't take long for the disappeared squad to become part of a Hetero-Creature after the Red Tide devoured them.	1																					
35	35		201							11	500004	7	-500																					
36	36		301							1	Asimov	What?!	11																					
37	37		301									Even the usually calm Asimov looks surprised alongside Nikola and Hassen.																						
38	38		201							11	500011	5	-500																					
39	39		301							1	Hassen	The Ascendants must be involved. Asimov, factor in this variable and run the simulation again.	11																					
40	40		201							11	500004		-500																					
41	41		301							1	Asimov	On it... Done. Factoring in the speed they're evolving now, the number of Hetero-Creatures will grow by 127 times even before the ocean is completely contaminated.	11																					
42	42		201							11	500011		-500																					
43	43		301							1	Hassen	We have to stop this. Let's use the Omega Weapons we salvaged from the moon.	11																					
44	44		201							11	500012		-500																					
45	45		301							1	Nikola	Those are all the Omega Weapons we have before we can restore the lunar base.	11																					
46	46		201							11	500011		-500																					
47	47		301							1	Hassen	Now's the time to show our cards. We shouldn't need many if we only deploy the Omega Weapons on the lower third floor.	11																					
48	48		201							11	500012		-500																					
49	49		301							1	Nikola	Don't forget that you're not authorized to use those Omega Weapons. Many in the Parliament are hoping to use them to clear the remaining Punishing Virus from the moon and rebuild the lunar base.	11																					
50	50		301								Nikola	If we don't have enough evidence to verify the threat, getting them to approve it is a pipe dream.	11																					
51	51		301								Nikola	We need comprehensive footage at the very least.	11																					
52	52		301								Bianca	The Purifying Force will continue to explore the lower third level after this call. We will be uploading the relevant footage as quickly as possible.	1																					
53	53		201							11	500011		-500																					
54	54		301							1	Hassen	...	11																					
55	55		301									Hassen does not answer. Beyond his terminal's view, the Purifying Force members are silently inspecting their gears and preparing to descend further.																						
56	56		301									Looking at the captain he handpicked himself, Hassen eventually nods.																						
57	57		301								Hassen	I'll start preparing a team to transport the Omega Weapons. Be careful.	11

64	64		201							1	500533	5																						
65	65		301							1	Bianca	Not yet. We still need to leave a few people here to protect the refugees.	1																					
66	66		201							1	500019																							
67	67		301							1		Many in the Purifying Force frown upon hearing that.																						
68	68		301								Purifying Force Member	Our priority should be investigating the lower third floor. It will end up costing us if we are even just one person short of delivering the intel.	1																					
69	69		201							1	500533	5																						
70	70		301							1	Bianca	We can't put innocent people at risk. Not to mention that we need to secure an exit as well.	1

72	72		301							1	Purifying Force Member	Hah. How innocent can they be when they voluntarily came here for the Ascendants?	1																					
73	73		301									The Purifying Force member sneers.																						
74	74		301								Purifying Force Member	But I agree with the rest of what you said. Everyone?	1																					
75	75		301									The members look at each other before a few of them promptly fall back.

79	79		302								You should stay too, Lucia.	80																						
80	80		301			DialogEnable						The Purifying Force is inexperienced in defensive operations. Keeping a seasoned fighter like Lucia here can certainly mitigate some risks.

82	82		301							1	Lucia	Understood. Are you going to follow Bianca, Commandant?	1																					
83	83		302								The Deep M.I.N.D. connection has a limited range. I have to go with her.	84																						
84	84		204							1	5																							
85	85		301								Lucia	I see. Please be careful.	1																					
86	86		301								Lucia	I'll guard the refugees and the exit with the Purifying Force.	1
