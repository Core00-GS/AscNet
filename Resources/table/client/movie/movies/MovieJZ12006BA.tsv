14	14		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		Chrome arrives at the address Asimov sent him, reaching the classified laboratory of the Science Council.																						
15	15		301									This is the first time Chrome is here. Constructs rarely have the chance to step inside the Science Council unless specifically requested by a mission.																						
16	16		301									Opening the door, Chrome finds someone he has not expected.																						
17	17		301								???	Chrome?																						
18	18		301								Chrome	You are...	1																					
19	19		301								???	Have you forgotten already? I was in charge of the operation that turned you into a Construct.																						
20	20		301								Chrome	Yes... Of course I remember. I'm just surprised that you remember me.	1																					
21	21		301								???	I remember the name of everyone I've turned into Construct.																						
22	22		301								???	Not to mention that you were one of my proudest works.																						
23	23		301								???	You're here for Asimov, aren't you? I remember him mentioning a visitor. I'm afraid he's still buried in work with the other technicians of the council.																						
24	24		301								???	An urgent R&D project on something called "bit domain."																						
25	25		301								???	So I'm doing his meet-and-greet for him until he's done with that.																						
26	26		301								Chrome	I'm here to submit this.	1																					
27	27		301									Chrome hands him the digital document he has been holding on to since the moment he left John's office.																						
28	28		301								???	This... is about the specialized frame.																						
29	29		301								???	A very detailed proposal... and very ambitious.																						
30	30		301								???	Is this your father's request?																						
31	31		301								Chrome	No, it is mine.	1																					
32	32		301								???	Oh? Is that so...																						
33	33		301									The researcher raises his brows, astonished, before flipping through the proposal.																						
34	34		301								???	Hmm... Still a Tank-type Construct, but with a focus on advances instead of defenses, unlike your current one.																						
35	35		301								???	Removing the artificial skin on the legs... Improving the cooling system, focusing on short burst capabilities, and maintaining high-speed movement... Is that really a good idea?																						
36	36		301								???	I seem to remember that the first request for this frame is "to resemble a human as much as possible."																						
37	37		301								Chrome	I have explained to my father that the abilities and direction of the new frame, as well as everything related, will be determined by me.	1																					
38	38		301								Chrome	Compared to non-essential aesthetics, we should focus more on optimization that benefits me on the battlefield.	1																					
39	39		301								???	You might have guessed it, but I still have to explain to you what is so special about this specialized frame.																						
40	40		301								???	It's difficult just to adapt to it. The specialized frame will be a stressful burden to your M.I.N.D.																						
41	41		301								???	Even if the adaptation works, it will still take a long time of adjustment before you can properly use the frame.																						
42	42		301								???	It'll take a long time, and the process is extremely painful... No less than the operation that turned you into a Construct.																						
43	43		301								???	There is barely any research on this frame. With nothing to reference, we have no idea what problem will surface in the future.																						
44	44		301								Chrome	I will work with you on the adjustment.	1																					
45	45		301								Chrome	I won't be as impulsive as I was.	1																					
46	46		301								???	Your eyes, they're different.																						
47	47		301								Chrome	Sorry?	1																					
48	48		301								???	They're different from how they were when you were first operated.																						
49	49		301								???	Back then, you were like a child abandoned by his parents, desperate to prove his worth.																						
50	50		301								???	You were only accepting what was happening to you, even when they were consequences of your choice.																						
51	51		301								???	You even accepted the specialized Inver-Device right out of the gate without inquiring what it does.																						
52	52		301								Chrome	Is... is that so?	1																					
53	53		301									Chrome is about to say something else when the door to the laboratory opens with a bang.																						
54	54		301								???	Oh, it's over? Here's the person you've been waiting for.																						
55	55		301									Asimov enters with a serious expression. His hair looks even messier than usual as if it has been ravaged in a fit of frustration.																						
56	56		301									Finding Chrome next to the researcher, Asimov pauses for a second before reverting to his usual calmness.

59	59		301							1	Asimov	Made up your mind?	2																					
60	60		301								Chrome	I did.	1																					
61	61		301									Asimov takes over the file from the researcher, reading through it with furrowed brows.																						
62	62		301								Asimov	...Pretty much what I expected.	2																					
63	63		301								Chrome	Will it work?	1																					
64	64		301								Asimov	The optimizations will work. The problem is still the specialized part of the specialized frame.	2																					
65	65		301								Asimov	You already know the theories and the risks of the project.	2																					
66	66		301								Chrome	I do.	1																					
67	67		301								Chrome	I'm here, which means I'm ready for the price.	1																					
68	68		301								Asimov	I'm afraid it isn't that simple... There will be many unexpected complications.	2																					
69	69		301								Asimov	Anyway, let's start with a virtual connection. The frame is still a prototype, but we'll see how much your M.I.N.D. deviates for now.	2																					
70	70		301								Asimov	I'll get the equipment ready. Wait here.	2

73	73		301									With that, Asimov goes back through the door, mumbling to himself.																						
74	74		301								???	I'll leave you to it, then.																						
75	75		301								???	The adaptation and the adjustment of the new frame will be done by Asimov in the future. Remember to cooperate, yeah?																						
76	76		301								Chrome	...	1																					
77	77		301								???	What? Do you want me to do it?																						
78	78		301								???	Unfortunately for you, I'm sick of this life here already. I'm turning into a Construct tomorrow! You'll soon find my name on the list of deployment.																						
79	79		301								???	...I'm kidding. I can't do it because the only person who knows the ins and outs of the specialized frame is the Chief Technician.																						
80	80		301								???	Plus... I did my test long ago. I'll never become a Construct.																						
81	81		301								???	So I'm staying right where I am until the end of the war or the end of my life.																						
82	82		301								???	Don't think that it's made my job easier. I'm still plenty busy right now.																						
83	83		301								???	After all, we're getting volunteer applications outside of the usual Construct program sometimes.																						
84	84		301								???	Perhaps... something is changing.																						
85	85		301								???	Regardless, I believe that you are the planet's future.																						
86	86		202							1					1																			
87	87		301									Looking at the blue planet outside the window, the researcher subtly smiles.																						
88	88		301									If there are sparks, then there are those who light them.																						
89	89		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Even today, someone still believes that Constructs, born from bloodshed and sacrifices, are humanity's future.

94	94		301								Chrome	Please begin.	2																					
95	95		301									Following Asimov's instructions, Chrome connects the connection cable to the back of his neck.																						
96	96		301								Asimov	I have to remind you that even if this is just a virtual connection, it might still affect your M.I.N.D. stability.	1																					
97	97		301								Asimov	Don't get careless. Eject if anything happens.	1																					
98	98		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					In the next second, Chrome falls into a data stream.

101	101		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						His M.I.N.D. stability hovers around the threshold in the virtual connection. Any fluctuation will result in deviation.																						
102	102		301									Chrome keeps his eyes closed until the impact and dizziness from the first connection pass before slowly opening his eyes.																						
103	103		301									He is standing in a space constructed from erroneous data. Alarms glowing in red float in the air all over the place.																						
104	104		301									This is what happens to his M.I.N.D. after connecting with the specialized frame, a situation that can only be described as "tricky."																						
105	105		301									Just like puzzle pieces trying to randomly match with one another or a yarn ball all tangled up, all kinds of information jumble together here.																						
106	106		301									There are disorderly memories, echoing raves, and nightmares yet to show up.																						
107	107		301									"What a waste of time."																						
108	108		301									"I'm disappointed in you."																						
109	109		301									"What can good grades and being a Chief do if he fails the connection test? He'll never be a commandant."																						
110	110		301									"They're no longer deployable."																						
111	111		301									"Capt—"																						
112	112		301									For a moment, the massive amount of information overwhelms Chrome's senses. Like opening Pandora's box, unignorable emotions from his fragmented memories flood over him.																						
113	113		301									The pain starts to eat away at his brain and takes over his mind.																						
114	114		301								Asimov	The adaptation rate is too low—your M.I.N.D. is overloading! You're showing signs of deviation already. I'm disconnecting you in five seconds!																						
115	115		301									Holding his trembling hand, Chrome gives a wry smile.																						
116	116		301									If this is what happens on a virtual connection, it is quite possible that he will immediately deviate before he can adapt to the new frame at this state.																						
117	117		301								Chrome	...This doesn't look good.																						
118	118		301									Chrome frowns, trying to stabilize and sort the chaotic data in his M.I.N.D. to no effect.																						
119	119		301								Chrome	...Is this the problem that a specialized frame faces?																						
120	120		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Chrome	This will be a difficult battle.

122	122		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Having disconnected from the virtual connection, Chrome opens his eyes.
