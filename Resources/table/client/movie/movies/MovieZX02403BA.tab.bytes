5	5		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You awake from a forest hunter's dream, in which things shift from running wolves to glimmering wanderers. The salty ocean breeze blows and the sailboat has its flag lowered.																						
6	6		301									A few sailors move between the boat and the land to transport cargo. Their tanned skins and strong muscles are proof of the epic adventures they experienced at sea.																						
7	7		301									You stand still as the sailor looks at you, but he is clearly much more interested in the cargo as he quickly looks away.

9	9		301									You approach him and politely ask for directions. You want to know what time it is and where to go. You describe the Naples you remember, hoping someone will give you some clues you can follow.

15	15		301									Some sailors ignore you, some shake their heads to turn you down, some only say a few words, while some are kind enough to stay a while and have a conversation. You thank each of them.

17	17		301							1		You learned some information. This is a secluded place far away from the inland. It is pretty much what you see and reckon. And the harbored sailboat will soon set out again to return to the somewhat peaceful kingdom capital.																						
18	18		301									Before the high walls of this city were built using cement, steel, and even blood, an evil dragon once crushed the military guards and stole the kingdom's treasure gem. It was a tragic event.																						
19	19		301									That evil dragon doesn't just exist in a certain person's nightmare. Flapping its invisible wings of death and breathing mysterious fog, the evil dragon overturns ships and plunges everyone aboard into the abyss.																						
20	20		301									The sailor goes quiet. His eyes have lost their shine as if hidden behind the sea mist.																						
21	21		301									It is as if he is recalling his time as a hero on the battlefield, his comrades in the past, or even his little daughter who died an untimely death.
