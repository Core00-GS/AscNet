5	5		301								Liv	...																						
6	6		301									Liv wants to speak, but her words are lost before they can reach her trembling lips. Her leg is in pain, but compared to that, what she feels in her chest is even worse. It is like something got stuck there and is pulling at her pain nerves.																						
7	7		301									No matter how many times she checks, the result is the same. The boy in front of her has grown cold and lifeless.																						
8	8		301									The sunlight at noon is warm. A gentle breeze echoes through the central courtyard and the empty halls like a playful child.																						
9	9		301									The exit to freedom is so close yet so far to reach for those trapped here.																						
10	10		301								Liv	...I... I...																						
11	11		301									The sorrow and sadness she tried so hard to bury inside her heart over these past few days are too much to bear. She can no longer hold it in. Her mind crumbles, letting out all her most emotional feelings. She hates herself.																						
12	12		301									The skinny border collie circles around his dead master, licking the blood that has run dry and turned black, but the wounds will never heal again.																						
13	13		301									It turns around and touches Liv's hand with his nose, telling her to use her bandage.																						
14	14		301								Liv	...																						
15	15		301									The girl dressed in a white suit looks down at the item in her hand. It is a gift that comes from her perilous journey over the past 31 hours.

25	25		301								Armed Refugee Leader	This conservation area is our promised land. We kept our side of the bargain and rebuilt it, but Babylonia took the liberty and gave it to someone else.	13																					
26	26		301								Armed Refugee Leader	Now that we have finally reclaimed what is rightfully ours, you filthy dogs still refuse to let us be?	13																					
27	27		301								Lucia	No. We just wanted to find shelter for the wounded people in these cars.	14																					
28	28		301								Armed Refugee Leader	Humph. I'm sick and tired of your excuses. They told us last time they had to prioritize those in need due to limited resources. And guess what happened? We were driven away and forced to rebuild another place!	13

33	31		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		Liv tries to explain the many benefits if everyone helps each other, but the Scavengers won't listen to reason.																						
34	32		301									In the end, what makes them compromise is the Hetero-Creature disaster that took place in City 043.																						
35	33		301									In exchange, all the Constructs but the Gray Ravens must remain there to stand guard and protect City 046 from the potential threat of more Hetero-Creatures.																						
36	34		301								Armed Refugee Leader	Since the threat is real, I will insist no longer. I hope we can survive together, but when things get out of hand, we'll have to save our own skin first.	13																					
37	35		301								Armed Refugee Leader	Bring your casualties inside. And don't forget your promises.	13																					
38	36		301								Lucia	Rest assured. I never go back on my words.	14																					
39	37		301									After helping the casualties and refugees settle down and handing over their duties in the conservation area of City 046 to the other guards, Gray Raven returns once again to City 043.

43	41		301									But what awaits them isn't the flat wasteland they used to see in the outskirt area of City 043. Instead, they see despair in crimson color.																						
44	42		510							2																								
45	43		301									This time, the Red Tide isn't as overwhelming as the one they encountered in City 075, but it is more than enough to submerge the outskirts of City 043.

50	48		301								Lucia	It's okay. I know an underground tunnel. It was a metro system abandoned halfway through its development. Many Corrupted workers still remain there.	12																					
51	49		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	This can be dangerous and we'll have to take a detour, but it is absolutely doable. And we'll make it there in time.	12

58	56		301									Without the commandant's access, they have no way of knowing in which city the twins are.

70	68		301								Lucia	We have to stop them!	2																					
71	69		301								Lee	We cannot directly make it through the Red Tide. But if we take a detour, we'll be too late.	3

78	76		301									Standing right next to the Red Tide, Lee shoots at the twins from 3.8 kilometers away several times. But the distance proves to be a problem as those shots fail to land on their targets.																						
79	77		301								Lee	Tsk. If only Snipe or Wanshi were here...	3																					
80	78		301								Liv	Wait a minute. I think they are turning around... and heading for us!	1																					
81	79		301								Lucia	Have we been spotted?	2																					
82	80		301								Liv	They are indeed approaching us. Perhaps they heard our voices?	1																					
83	81		301								Lee	Another possibility is those creatures have learned... or should I say stolen the movement detecting technologies from a certain Construct.	3																					
84	82		301								Lucia	In any case, we have managed to draw our targets' attention. Let's split up and retreat. We must not engage them in a fight!	2																					
85	83		301								Lee	Alright.	3

88	86		301									The three of them immediately jump off the car and run off in different directions under the cover of the night.																						
89	87		301									The twins seem to have noticed this trick and stopped for a few seconds to rethink their next move.																						
90	88		301									Then, they imitate Gray Raven's tactic. The male twin turns to chase Lee as the female twin follows closely behind Liv and Lucia.																						
91	89		301									The pursuit continues for hours. They hunt Gray Raven with such ease that it is more like they are playing with their prey.

111	108		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The three of them suffer different levels of injuries. Liv's leg, previously bandaged and supported by a splint, fractures completely. She can barely move without Lucia helping her.

113	110		301									The three of them split up to search for survivors in City 043, but Vanessa and Bambinata are nowhere to be found.																						
114	111		301									Tired and wounded, Liv trudges back to the conservation area only to find the three people who stayed behind have passed away.																						
115	112		301								Liv	...																						
116	113		301									All the deaths that Liv witnessed before didn't make her indifferent or cold-hearted. She regrets her inability to save lives.																						
117	114		301								Liv	If only I had the ability to change all this, or had I been able to take them with us, I would've been able to save them. Cali, Lina, Stanley, Vanessa, Bambinata... all of them...

131	128		301							1	Nikola	But there is no "would have."	1																					
132	129		301								Nikola	Devastated by the disaster and hunted by our enemies, neither the victims nor our Gray Raven had time to react. And those maniacs wouldn't wait either.	1

142	139		301							1		In the footage, Gray Raven barely managed to complete the rescue mission at the crash site and throw the Omega Prototype at the male twin.																						
143	140		301									Coming into contact with the cube, his "skin" started to fester, melt, and peel off.																						
144	141		301									Like a human, he wailed and watched as the skin fell to the ground.

151	148		301							1	Liv	Okay!	13																					
152	149		301									After an ugly fight, they finally landed the Omega Prototype on the female twin as well. The same festering process occurred, this time eating away her hands and chest.																						
153	150		301									‚ÄîNot only that, the festering wounds caused by this weapon didn't heal shortly afterward.																						
154	151		201							13	500026		400

170	167		301									After the two went out of sight, the twins finally started to observe the Omega Prototype dropped on the ground.																						
171	168		301									They no longer made physical contact. Instead, they found tools from their surroundings and used them to touch the cube in front of them.
