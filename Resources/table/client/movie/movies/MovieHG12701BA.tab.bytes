3	3		301			DialogEnable						After an extremely difficult mission, the Parliament approved a few days of holiday for most commandants.																						
4	4		301									While you don't need to go out, there are still tons of documents accumulated over time for you to process.																						
5	5		301									There is no such thing as a holiday. Catching up on the paperwork is enough to keep you occupied.																						
6	6		301									There is no escape from these repetitious and uneventful days...																						
7	7		302								If only there were something special happening...	8																						
8	8		301								Nanami	Commandant!																						
9	9		301								Nanami	Com‚Äîman‚Äîdant!																						
10	10		301								Nanami	Commandant, are you here?																						
11	11		301									Nanami's voice arrives way before she does. Her typical style. But to come here at this point in time...																						
12	12		302								Is that considered special?	13																						
13	13		401							2	561																							
14	14		301									"PANG!"																						
15	15		301									After signing the familiar repair report for the door, the energetic Nanami arrives at your desk.																						
16	16		201							1	500091	1				1																		
17	17		301							1	Nanami	I knew you'd be here, Commandant!	1																					
18	18		204							1	8																							
19	19		301								Nanami	Nanami is your assistant for the day. Ahem...	1																					
20	20		301									Nanami clears her throat.																						
21	21		204							1	1																							
22	22		301								Nanami	Nanami reporting! Any order, Commandant?	1																					
23	23		302								Not really.	24	You are my assistant?	25																				
24	24	26	301								Nanami	Then you're free to help me with something, Commandant!	1																					
25	25		301								Nanami	I am now! Because Nanami has a favor to ask you, Commandant.	1																					
26	26		301									Is that what an assistant does? You remain suspicious, but your words are honest‚Äî																						
27	27		302								What is it?	28

30	30		301								???	An analysis of the target human's tone and temperature change indicates the target's level of willingness to continue working is 0.543%.																						
31	31		301									You hear a strange robotic voice with electrical crackles coming from the corridor. It sounds quite horrifying when it comes out of nowhere.																						
32	32		402							914																								
33	33		302								?	34	...	36																				
34	34		201							1	500091	1				1																		
35	35	38	301							1	Nanami	Haha, isn't it fun, Commandant? That's Nanami's new friend, Maple.	1																					
36	36		201							1	500091	1				1																		
37	37		301								Nanami	Haha, Commandant, did Maple scare you?	1																					
38	38		301									Without gaining your approval, Nanami pulls a large "office chair" inside the room.																						
39	39		202							1					1																			
40	40		302								Maple... is a chair?	41																						
41	41		301									Its main structure is an office chair indeed, but it is also connected to various circuits, screens and control panels.																						
42	42		301									Dated parts, uneven paint, rust marks...																						
43	43		301									It feels like Nanami has dug out the cockpit of some vehicle from a few centuries ago and brought it here.																						
44	44		301									When you move closer, you find a green, freaky smiley face flickering on a small CRT screen.																						
45	45		302								Are you sure this isn't a torturing tool?	46	What is this?	48																				
46	46		201							1	500091	8				1																		
47	47	50	301							1	Nanami	Of course not!	1																					
48	48		201							1	500091	8				1																		
49	49		301								Nanami	Precisely speaking, Maple is...	1																					
50	50		202							1					1																			
51	51		301								Maple	Maple is a truly humanized smart virtual reality chair. Nanami created me to bring you more joy. I hope you will like me.																						
52	52		301								Maple	Hello, „Äêkuroname„Äë.																						
53	53		301								Maple	You do not know me, but Maple knows everything about you.																						
54	54		301								Maple	I want to play a game.																						
55	55		201							1	500091	1				1																		
56	56		301							1	Nanami	Maple! Did I let you answer before me?	1																					
57	57		301									Maple makes a series of descending electrical sounds. The fluorescent eyes on its screen have also lowered, looking sad and disheartened.																						
58	58		301								Maple	Bzzzz‚ÄîMaple is sorry. Maple is a good child. Maple should not interrupt while Nanami is talking.																						
59	59		204							1																								
60	60		301								Nanami	Ahem... As Maple said, it can help Nanami to recreate all sorts of scenes.	1																					
61	61		302								VR?	62																						
62	62		301								Nanami	It's more than just virtual reality. In fact, some of Nanami's wisdom has been lent to Maple!	1																					
63	63		301								Nanami	That's why Maple can do a lot of things that regular VR devices cannot.	1																					
64	64		204							1	8																							
65	65		301								Nanami	Babylonia is so stingy on resource management. All my applications were rejected.	1																					
66	66		301								Nanami	It took me a lot of time and effort digging up the junkyard before finally managing to assemble enough computing power for Maple.	1																					
67	67		204							1	1																							
68	68		301								Nanami	Commandant, do you still remember our date?	1																					
69	69		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The topic she suddenly brings up jogs your memories‚Äî

77	77		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Nanami	Second stop, let's go to the haunted house! ...Though ghosts aren't real at all.	1

94	94		302								(Nod hard in grief)	95	Hard to forget.	96																				
95	95	97	301								Nanami	But that date was nowhere near enough!	1																					
96	96		301								Nanami	Nanami remembers it clearly. But it was still not enough!	1																					
97	97		301								Nanami	Nanami had a great time with you, but somehow I just felt something was missing.	1																					
98	98		204							1	8																							
99	99		301								Nanami	I thought about it for a long time and finally found out the reason.	1																					
100	100		204							1	1																							
101	101		302								What is it?	102																						
102	102		301								Nanami	The location!	1																					
103	103		301								Nanami	I looked up the database. People used to date on beaches, cinemas, or streets. All of them are no longer around.	1																					
104	104		301								Nanami	So, I built Maple to resolve this particular problem.	1																					
105	105		301								Nanami	I have added many locations where I'd like to have a date with you in Maple. There are a total of... How many?	1																					
106	106		301								Maple	Report: Nanami has saved a total of 4294967296 locations, 65536 weather effects, and 18446744073709551616 sudden events in Maple.																						
107	107		204							1

111	111		202							1					1																			
112	112		301									Nanami pats on Maple. Its seat squeaks, and you see small electrical sparks on the tangled cables.																						
113	113		301								Maple	^_^ 																						
114	114		302								...	115																						
115	115		302								Better not.	116																						
116	116		201							1	500091	14				1																		
117	117		301							1	Nanami	Huh?	1																					
118	118		301									Nanami sounds shocked.																						
119	119		302								I've still got paperwork to do.	120	I don't feel good about this.	122																				
120	120		204							1																								
121	121	124	301								Nanami	Just put them away for now, Commandant. You hate them, don't you?	1																					
122	122	125	204							1	1																							
123	123		301								Nanami	Don't worry, Maple is absolutely safe. Even if it's not, you still have me!	1																					
124	124		204							1	1																							
125	125		301								Nanami	Pleeease, Commandant‚ÄîNanami would love to take this opportunity to know more about you.	1																					
126	126		202							1					1																			
127	127		301									Without further explanation, Nanami drags you toward Maple. A human's strength is nowhere near a Construct's, and she presses you onto the seat.																						
128	128		301									Despite its dilapidated look, Maple is surprisingly comfortable to sit in.																						
129	129		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					But the comfort is fleeting as Nanami puts a fully enclosed metal helmet on your head.

133	133		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						"Click!"																						
134	134		301									The thick metal blocks all the light. You can only feel the smell of rust and stuffy darkness.																						
135	135		301								Nanami	Are you ready, Commandant?																						
136	136		301									Her voice bounces around inside the metal helmet, making a humming echo that bombards your skull.																						
137	137		301									Still, you can clearly feel her eagerness and excitement. Somehow, this has calmed you down.																						
138	138		302								(It's too late to say no.)	139																						
139	139		301									Accepting your fate, you give a thumbs up toward the direction of her voice.																						
140	140		301								Nanami	Beginning to connect!																						
141	141		301								Nanami	I'll see you on the other side, Commandant.																						
142	142		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					You hear a long beep. The seat under you suddenly thrusts forward, and you cannot tell whether the propulsion is virtual or real. You feel your mind accelerating in a deep sea or space until it crashes into a blazing white light.
