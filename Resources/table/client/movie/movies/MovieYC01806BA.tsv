38	38		301									Within a split second of metallic scrapping, the Corrupted's broken body appears within its own visual module.																						
39	39		301									The signals received in its electric shell gradually fades to nothingness as its head collides with the ground. The last image branded in its memory is a flash of bright red.

47	47		301									Lucia cleans the Corrupted oil off her katana with a flick of her wrist. She kneels at the ready, then sprints off in the direction indicated by Liv.																						
48	48		301									A small red light flashes through Lucia's visual module. With her keen perception, she quickly glances in the direction of the red light to see a Jitterbomb lying there.																						
49	500		204							2	5																							
50	49		301								Lucia	!!	2																					
51	50		301									Seeing the Jitterbomb, Lucia quickly withdraws behind cover. However, to her surprise, there is no explosion.

54	53		201							1	1011001		-400																					
55	54		301							1	Lee	I overloaded it. If a threat exposes itself, I won't let it remain a threat to us.	1																					
56	55		301								Lee	I won't allow myself to make the same mistake twice.	1																					
57	501		204							2	1																							
58	56		301								Lucia	Thanks.	2																					
59	57		301								Lee	Don't let your guard down.	1																					
60	58		401							2	1510																							
61	59		301									Right as Lucia hears the message on the comms, a bullet from Lee flies past her and takes out a Corrupted rushing toward her. However, due to the distance, the bullet fails to pierce the Corrupted's protective casing. Seizing the opportunity, Lucia flips her katana up and stabs the Corrupted in the head.																						
62	60		301								Lucia	I've eliminated all the nearby Corrupted.	2																					
63	61		301								Lee	Same here.	1																					
64	502		204							2	5

67	64		301							1	Liv	Roger.	1																					
68	65		301									Liv raises her hands slightly, hindering the horde of Corrupted's movement. A pink electric current flows between Liv and her Levi-Gun.																						
69	66		301								Liv	Control secured for 13 seconds. I'll leave the rest up to you all.	1																					
70	67		301								Lucia	Alright, Commandant. It's our turn.	2

74	71		302								Don't worry.	72																						
75	72		302								Our instructor taught us how to handle a situation like this.	73

78	75		301									In the distance, Lucia waves her left hand, giving the attack command. Lee charges out from within the shadows of a nearby building.																						
79	76		302								(Climb over barricade)	77																						
80	77		301									You climb over the barricade and quickly charge toward the horde of Corrupted.																						
81	78		301									As Lucia and Lee advance down the street, Corrupted fall before their blade and gun one after another.																						
82	79		201							1	500013																							
83	80		401							2	1508																							
84	81		301							1		As you advance, a Corrupted blocks your way forward.		1																				
85	83		401							2	1510																							
86	84		301									You aim the muzzle of your gun between its eyes and pull the trigger. The Corrupted falls to the ground with a heavy thud.																						
87	85		201							1	500292	5																						
88	86		301							1	Liv	Commandant, on your left!	1																					
89	87		202							1					1																			
90	88		301									Even though Liv is suppressing the enemy's movements, that does not mean their attacks are any weaker.																						
91	89		301									You turn to the left, barely managing to parry the Corrupted's incoming attack. A bullet flies past you, putting an end to the Corrupted standing before you.																						
92	90		201							1	1011001																							
93	91		301							1	Lee	Get your head in the game!	1																					
94	92		302								(Open fire)	93																						
95	93		401							2	1510																							
96	94		301									Raising the gun, you shoot past Lee and kill a Corrupted about to attack him from behind.																						
97	95		302								You too.	96																						
98	96		301								Lee	Hmph.	1																					
99	97		301									In order to maintain stability with the gun, you subconsciously use too much strength in your hands, causing blood to slowly seep from your bandages.																						
100	98		201							1	500292	5																						
101	99		301								Liv	Com. Man. Dant.	1																					
102	100		302								Oops, you caught me.	102																						
103	101		202							1					1																			
104	102		301									With the collective efforts of the Gray Ravens, the horde of Corrupted on the street has finally been cleared. Liv suddenly appears next to you. She grabs your hands despite you intentionally keeping them behind your back and out of view.																						
105	103		201							1	500292	5																						
106	104		301							1	Liv	Don't move. I need to give you emergency medical care.	1																					
107	105		202							1					1																			
108	106		301									After confirming that all Corrupted have been eliminated, Lucia and Lee walk over to you and Liv.																						
109	107		301									Liv expertly bandages both of your hands, then both of you look up at Lee and Lucia as they approach.																						
110	108		201							2	500029																							
111	109		301							1	Lucia	What's wrong, Commandant?	2																					
112	110		302								I'm all good. No worries.	111

117	115		302								Let's keep moving. The factory is up ahead.	116																						
118	116		302								The threat will only get worse if we wait any longer.	117																						
119	117		302								We need to cut them off at the source ASAP.	118																						
120	118		301			DialogEnable					Lee	Understood.	1																					
121	119		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Agreed. Let's proceed as the commandant has directed.	2
