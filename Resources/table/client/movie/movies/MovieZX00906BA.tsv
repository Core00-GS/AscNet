6	5		302								Is that good?	6	What's wrong?	6																				
7	6		301								Liv	It could be due to the space station's expelling action.	1																					
8	7		301								Lee	Good, the electromagnetic lock is still functioning. This is an old system, so it shouldn't be too difficult to manually change the parameters.	2																					
9	8		302								If we can infiltrate the main system...	9	Liv?	9																				
10	9		301								Lee	I agree.	2																					
11	10		301								Lee	Liv, how long can you stay in hacking mode?	2																					
12	11		301								Liv	About three minutes...	1																					
13	12		301								Lee	That's not enough. It takes at least five from changing the parameters and initialization till the lock is up and running.	2
