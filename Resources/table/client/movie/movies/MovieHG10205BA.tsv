5	5		302								Let's get rid of the twin tails then.	6	Let's observe for a while more.	6

7	7		301							1	Liv	I don't think Lucia hates the twin tails.	1																					
8	8		302								Liv, do you know something?	9	Then why would Lucia want to remodel the frame?	9																				
9	9		301								Liv	I saw her looking at her own reflection in the mirror for quite some time when she first received the new frame.	1																					
10	10		302							100	There are mirrors in this base?!	13	Lucia was admiring her own reflection?!	14

13	13	15	301							1	Lee	Why are you so surprised? We brought back some as resources before.	1																					
14	14		301							1	Lee	And she's still a girl, isn't it normal to look at her own reflection?	1																					
15	15		201							1	1031001																							
16	16		301							1	Liv	If Lucia really didn't like the twin tails, she would've changed her frame back immediately.	1																					
17	17		201							1	1011001																							
18	18		301							1	Lee	So the question is, why would Lucia want to remodel the frame?	1																					
19	19		302							101	Maybe she thinks it's too childish.	22	Because it doesn't look strong.	23

22	22	24	301							1	Lucia	Yes.	1																					
23	23		301							1	Lucia	The frame performance is good... but the twin tails are a no.	1																					
24	24		201							1	1031001																							
25	25		301							1	Liv	Lucia?	1																					
26	26		201							1	1021001																							
27	27		301							1	Lucia	The twin tails... They don't really suit me, do they?	1																					
28	28		301								Lucia	Commandant, I know what kind of impression I leave.	1																					
29	29		301								Lucia	And such a girly and cute hairstyle like twin tails...	1																					
30	30		302								I think it really suits you, Lucia.	31	It's not that bad.	31																				
31	31		201							1	1031001																							
32	32		301							1	Liv	I also think twin tails suit you, Lucia. If you don't mind, why don't you try it on again?	1

34	34		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Lucia	Do you think so too, Commandant?	1
