5	5		301									She is scared of death, pain and hunger. In fact, she fears everything. She is always full of emotions. Amongst them, she is like an alien from another world.																						
6	6		301									Are all the people ruthless like them, or is she just too weak?

11	11		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The medical director seems to be always busy writing things recently. The books and notes on his desk stack like a mountain.																						
12	12		301									Lamia has a deep impression on him because he has been taking care of her for a long time.																						
13	13		301									Maybe "feeding" is a more appropriate description.																						
14	14		301									To him, Lamia is probably just a collection of many parameters.																						
15	15		301									Height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, vital capacity, basic metabolism. As long as these numbers are normal, he would not spend a little more time on Lamia.																						
16	16		301									Lamia once tried to scream and cry in front of him.																						
17	17		301									He had only one reaction: to diagnose if Lamia had any mental illness. After confirming that she was only throwing a tantrum, he immediately went back to work.

22	22		301							1	Lamia	What are you doing, uncle?	2																					
23	23		301								Medical Director	Working.	1																					
24	24		301								Lamia	But your job is to treat patients, isn't it?	2																					
25	25		301								Medical Director	That was the old one. My mission has changed.	1																					
26	26		301								Lamia	What do you mean that your mission has changed?	2																					
27	27		301								Medical Director	Soon, there won't be a medical director. I need to write down the instructions for my colleagues so they know how to use the medications.	1																					
28	28		301								Lamia	I... don't understand.	2																					
29	29		301									To her surprise, he is not annoyed by her ignorance.																						
30	30		301								Medical Director	You know we are running low on rations, don't you?	1																					
31	31		301								Lamia	Yes.	2																					
32	32		301								Medical Director	Our food supplies won't last too long.	1																					
33	33		204							2	19																							
34	34		301								Lamia	What should we do then?	2																					
35	35		301								Medical Director	Easy. We just need to cut down on consumption.	1																					
36	36		301								Lamia	H-how are you going to do that?	2																					
37	37		301								Medical Director	We can let some people starve to death.	1																					
38	38		301									Lamia opens her eyes wide.																						
39	39		301								Lamia	B-but, who is going to die?	2																					
40	40		301								Medical Director	The order is determined by how important their roles are to our current research.	1																					
41	41		204							2																								
42	42		301								Medical Director	Starting from the admin department, followed by the logistics and then the medical department.	1																					
43	43		301								Lamia	Are you... going to die too?	2																					
44	44		301									He sounds extremely calm.																						
45	45		301								Medical Director	Of course. As a member of the medical department, I am no exception.	1																					
46	46		301								Lamia	...	2																					
47	47		301									The medical director never looks back. Lamia only sees his cold, distant back. He has not even stopped doing what he is doing.																						
48	48		301									But Lamia is overwhelmed with fear.																						
49	49		301									She can't help but raise her voice.																						
50	50		204							2	19																							
51	51		301								Lamia	What about me?	2																					
52	52		301								Medical Director	What?	1																					
53	53		301								Lamia	Am I... also going to starve to death?	2																					
54	54		301								Medical Director	Oh, you are quite special. Technically, you don't belong to any of the departments... The research director probably has other arrangements, but you won't stay long because you are of no use to us.	1																					
55	55		301								Medical Director	Now that you have asked, I can check with the admin department and see which group they will put you in.	1																					
56	56		301								Lamia	I... I...	2																					
57	57		204							2	19																							
58	58		301									Tears swell out of her eyes.																						
59	59		301									The medical director finally turns around after hearing her cry.																						
60	60		301								Medical Director	Are you crying?	1																					
61	61		301									Lamia can no longer control her voice. She only sobs even harder.																						
62	62		301								Lamia	I...	2																					
63	63		301								Lamia	I don't want to...	2																					
64	64		301								Lamia	I don't want to die.	2																					
65	65		301								Medical Director	You can't talk like this.	1																					
66	66		301								Medical Director	Get yourself together, then we can talk.	1																					
67	67		301									He focuses on his work again.																						
68	68		301									After some time, Lamia's temper finally calms down.																						
69	69		301									Her voice becomes hoarse and her eyes are all swollen.																						
70	70		301									Her sleeves are a complete mess from tears and snot.																						
71	71		301									After hearing she has stopped crying, the medical director turns back again.																						
72	72		301								Medical Director	Can you talk properly now? Say yes or no.	1																					
73	73		204							2																								
74	74		301								Lamia	...Yes.	2																					
75	75		301								Medical Director	Why do you want to live?	1																					
76	76		204							2	19																							
77	77		301								Lamia	Why would anyone not want to?!	2																					
78	78		301								Lamia	Have you all gone crazy?!	2																					
79	79		301								Medical Director	There is no point in venting your emotions. You didn't get my question. Let me ask you in a different way.	1																					
80	80		301								Medical Director	Is there anything you must do?	1																					
81	81		204							2																								
82	82		301								Lamia	...No.	2																					
83	83		301								Medical Director	Is there anything that cannot be completed without you?	1																					
84	3000		301								Lamia	No...	2																					
85	84		301								Medical Director	Then I cannot see any necessity for your survival, either subjectively or passively.	1																					
86	85		204							2	19																							
87	86		301								Lamia	I don't know what you mean by necessity! I just don't want to die!	2																					
88	87		301								Medical Director	Control your temper.	1																					
89	88		301								Lamia	There isn't anything I "must" do! But there are lots of things I want to do, but haven't done yet!	2																					
90	89		204							2																								
91	90		301								Lamia	I want to go to the land.	2																					
92	91		301								Medical Director	Then? What are you going to do next?	1																					
93	92		301								Lamia	I don't know.	2																					
94	93		301								Medical Director	You don't even know what you want to do. Why do you still want to go to the land?	1																					
95	94		301								Lamia	I just want to see if the land looks like what the books say.	2																					
96	95		301								Lamia	I want to see mountains and forests with my own eyes. I want to step on sand and soil. I want to smell the grass after rain and find out if the wind on land sounds different from the wind here on the sea.	2																					
97	96		301								Medical Director	There are sand and gravel samples in the sample room. Oh, and soil too. The land is nothing different.	1																					
98	97		301								Lamia	No. It's different.	2																					
99	98		301								Medical Director	Why?	1																					
100	99		301								Lamia	...I can't tell why, but I know it's not the same.	2

104	103		301									The medical director stares at her. His glasses reflect a cold white light.																						
105	104		301									After a long time, the light seems to have softened a little.																						
106	105		301								Medical Director	I understand. It's "curiosity."	1																					
107	106		301								Medical Director	I gave up a lot of things to join Atlantis and work here.	1																					
108	107		301								Medical Director	You are... amazing. You just reminded me of some things I gave up.	1

112	111		301								Medical Director	You want to live, don't you?	1																					
113	112		301									Lamia nods hard.																						
114	113		301								Medical Director	Then you need to become "valuable" to us. This is Atlantis' rule. We have no room for anything useless.	1																					
115	114		301								Lamia	How can I become "valuable"?	2																					
116	115		301								Medical Director	Don't be so impatient. Let me think about it.	1																					
117	116		301								Medical Director	...Right, there's a way. Quite risky though.	1																					
118	117		301								Lamia	I will take it.	2																					
119	118		301								Medical Director	Let me finish first.	1																					
120	119		301								Medical Director	Before the outburst of the Punishing Virus, the Science Council was working on a technology that could transform humans into modified machines.	1																					
121	120		301								Medical Director	The technology is not mature yet, but we can give you modifications based on it. Let me think... You don't have lower limbs, so I'd better give you some bionic ones that can help you adapt to the sea. That way, you can go out and collect information for us.	1																					
122	121		301								Medical Director	As a source of information, you will become valuable.	1																					
123	122		301								Medical Director	But I must warn you that in theory, only humans with sufficient Tantalum-193 affinity are qualified for such modification. We only have access to the prototype technology. Maybe it has been updated, but I don't know—our job was never to study or modify humans.	1																					
124	123		301								Medical Director	We have no idea what the civilization has become out there. Neither do we know whether the modification can protect you from the Punishing Virus. Do you still want to go out?	1																					
125	124		301								Lamia	I will take it.	2
