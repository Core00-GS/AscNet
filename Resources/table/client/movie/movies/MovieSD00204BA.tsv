7	7		301							1	Forsaken Member A	Yes, sir. Even with the support from Akdilek, we're still unable to avoid this plight.	2																					
8	8		301								Watanabe	...This is just the way it is. They were devices deployed long ago, after all. See if you can recycle anything from the stash.	1																					
9	9		301								Forsaken Member A	Roger.	2

11	11		301									Inside the Forsaken hideout, the well-organized Watanabe is giving out directives.																						
12	12		201							1	1101001

16	16		301							1	Forsaken Member B	The area around here has been getting more dangerous recently. Should we...	2																					
17	17		301								Watanabe	Have the scouts assess our surroundings again. We'll move our hideout if their report comes to the same conclusion.	1																					
18	18		301								Forsaken Member B	Understood. I'll join the scouting party as well, then.	2																					
19	19		301								Watanabe	Don't linger. Retreat if you have to, understood?	1																					
20	20		301								Forsaken Member B	Of course, sir.	2																					
21	21		202							1	2				1																			
22	22		301									The Forsaken might be an organization of a certain scale, but the lack of resources has kept them in a passive position for a very long time.																						
23	23		301									Every move they make, Watanabe and the Forsakens are always walking on thin ice in order to keep all of their members safe.																						
24	24		201							1	1101001																							
25	25		301							1	Watanabe	Alright, next.	1																					
26	26		301									...																						
27	27		301								Watanabe	Hmm, next?	1																					
28	28		401							1	205																							
29	29		301								Child A	Here, Mr. Watanabe!																						
30	30		301									The multitasking Watanabe is so occupied that he has not noticed the significantly shorter company seeking consultation.																						
31	31		301								Watanabe	Ugh, kids...	1																					
32	32		301								Child A	We ain't no kids! We're valuable members who just helped giving out food!																						
33	33		301								Watanabe	Sigh... Alright, alright.	1																					
34	34		301								Watanabe	So how can I help you? If you're asking for candies, I'm sorry, but those are needed elsewhere.	1																					
35	35		301								Child A	That's not why we're here!																						
36	36		301									The group of kids protests by giving Watanabe the stink eye. That is when he realizes that the children have yet to attack him with their typical "fists of justice."																						
37	37		301								Watanabe	Why are you all hiding your hands behind your backs? Don't tell me you've found more things to prank the others.	1																					
38	38		301								Child A	Ah—that is...																						
39	39		301									The children try to hide the thing behind them, but Watanabe easily notices what it is, given how much taller he is.																						
40	40		301									Covered in a thin layer of sand and misshapen from all the mishandling is a bouquet of flowers.																						
41	41		301								Watanabe	Flowers...?	1																					
42	42		301								Child A	That's right. We were going to surprise you.																						
43	43		301								Child A	But now that we've been discovered—everyone!																						
44	44		301								Child B	Yep!																						
45	45		301								Children	Merry Christmas, Mr. Watanabe!																						
46	46		301								Watanabe	Uh... But I don't think it's Christmas yet?	1																					
47	47		301								Child A	That's what you say? Not "thank you"?																						
48	48		301								Child B	Say "thank you"!																						
49	49		301								Watanabe	...Alright, I got it, stop kicking me—thank you! I said it! Thank you!	1																					
50	50		301									Yielding to their violent acts, Watanabe thanks them and takes the flowers.																						
51	51		301								Watanabe	By the way...	1																					
52	52		301								Child A	I guess you're wondering why we're giving you your Christmas present now.																						
53	53		301								Child A	Because flowers wilt quickly in a place like this, we want to give it to you before it dies.																						
54	54		301								Child B	It'll be too late if we wait 'til Christmas.																						
55	55		301								Watanabe	I see...	1																					
56	56		301								Watanabe	Thank you.	1																					
57	57		301								Child A	Hmph, I'm glad we've come to an understanding. Just so you know, the flowers are edible, so remember to bring them to the guys in Logistics to make us some snacks!																						
58	58		301									The children quickly disperse and go on their merry ways after Watanabe receives his gift.																						
59	59		301								Watanabe	Those kids...	1																					
60	60		301									Their "smarts" have gotten Watanabe chuckling. Putting down the flowers on his desk, he is about to see the next person when—

64	64		201							2	500005		400																					
65	65		301							1	Forsaken Member C	Mr. Watanabe, a message from Babylonia.	2																					
66	66		301								Watanabe	Babylonia?	1																					
67	67		301								Watanabe	Show me what it says.	1																					
68	68		301								Comms	...																						
69	69		301								Comms	...																						
70	70		301								Watanabe	I see. I suppose that's worth responding. Do we have any devices that can connect to the satellite?	1																					
71	71		301								Forsaken Member C	We do. But, sir, are you going to show up on their screen like this?	2																					
72	72		301								Watanabe	Sure, what's wrong with it?	1																					
73	73		301								Forsaken Member C	Everything! We can't have the Babylonians seeing the face and leader of the Forsaken covered in dirt. Where's our pride?	2																					
74	74		301								Watanabe	I know what you're saying... but I usually look like this as well.	1																					
75	75		301								Forsaken Member C	But this isn't a usual call, is it? Just grab a seat, and I'll find someone to put some makeup on you.	2																					
76	76		301								Watanabe	But I'm a dude?	1																					
77	77		301								Forsaken Member C	So what? Makeup applies to people on the whole spectrum. Not that I'm going to put lipstick on you, so just listen to me.	2																					
78	78		301								Watanabe	Sigh... Fine, just get it done quickly.	1																					
79	79		301								Forsaken Member C	Yes, sir! I got this!	2

82	82		301									After sending his very insistent companion away, Watanabe sneakily turns on the satellite connection.																						
83	83		301								Watanabe	I'm too old for makeup... Cough.	1																					
84	84		301									After connecting, Watanabe clears his throat before speaking to the screen.																						
85	85		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Watanabe	So, this is Watanabe...	1
