23	23		301							1	Chrome	That should be all the Corrupted we could find in this area.	2

25	25		301								Kamui	Hurray! We've earned ourselves a little break now, haven't we?	1																					
26	26		204							1	1																							
27	27		301								Chrome	Not until we finish the battle report... What can you tell me about the difference between the Elite Corrupted you fought and our regular enemies, Kamui?	2																					
28	28		301								Kamui	Erm... Capt, feel free to write it down yourselves. You probably knew what it was already when you asked me, so what use is my answer anyway?	1																					
29	29		301								Chrome	...I'm trying to train you on something other than combat.	2																					
30	30		301								Chrome	Fine. I fought eleven of them, and they didn't act weird or anything.	2																					
31	31		301									Chrome is filing the report no Strike Hawk member is willing to do, recording everything that has happened since their mission started.																						
32	32		301								Kamui	By the way, Capt, if you've been doing that report the whole time, did you write down what's happened recently?	1																					
33	33		301								Chrome	Of course. Everything the Strike Hawk has done is well recorded on this portable terminal, and a copy of it goes to the Ministry of War when we're back on Babylonia.	2																					
34	34		301								Chrome	Why are you asking? Something on your mind?	2																					
35	35		301								Kamui	I just suddenly realized that it has been quite eventful recently, hasn't it?	1																					
36	36		301								Kamui	First, it was the infiltration on the Nighter... By the way, we should get a dress that properly fits next time. The one I wore was such a hassle.	1																					
37	37		301								Kamui	Ideally, something that separates the top from the bottom part of the dress. It'll be much easier for me to get out of it.	1																					
38	38		301								Chrome	Does that mean you want to do it again...	2																					
39	39		204							1																								
40	40		301								Kamui	And then it was the battle in the Kowloong Metropolis. Didn't expect that outcome.	1																					
41	41		301								Chrome	The Ascendants became much more active afterward, and our squad has been forced to stay on Earth for the long haul as well.	2																					
42	42		301								Kamui	I wish we could convince the Ascendants like how we had done with Kowloong. There wouldn't have been so many sacrifices...	1																					
43	43		301								Chrome	But that's impossible. As long as the Punishing Virus remains a "virus," nothing about it can be changed.	2																					
44	44		301								Kamui	But Camu took the... He...	1																					
45	45		301								Chrome	We can't expect everyone to turn into what he is. And I don't think anyone would want another Transcendant if possible.	2																					
46	46		301								Chrome	Not taking a side is a worrisome stance.	2																					
47	47		301								Kamui	After that...	1																					
48	48		301								Kamui	There were those fights that were so epic that they've changed the world order...	1																					
49	49		301								Chrome	But we've survived all of them, relying on our hard work and our companions—hmm, companion?	2																					
50	50		301								Kamui	What's wrong, Capt?	1																					
51	51		301								Chrome	Speaking of companions, I just realized that... Wanshi's not here? Wasn't he with us just a while ago?	2																					
52	52		204							1	2																							
53	53		301								Kamui	Oh, I buried him.	1																					
54	54		301								Chrome	...You buried him?!	2																					
55	55		204							1	1																							
56	56		301								Kamui	That guy was like, "you and Capt can probably handle this anyway," and then he found a spot to sleep, and he had the nerve to tell me to tuck him in.	1																					
57	57		301								Kamui	So I tucked him in real good, with a lot of bricks and a little sign that says, "Here lies Wanshi, beloved friend..."	1																					
58	58		301								Chrome	You two...	2																					
59	59		301								Comms	—																						
60	60		204							1																								
61	61		301								Kamui	Oh, a message! Maybe it's Wanshi asking for help?	1																					
62	62		301								Kamui	What's up, Wanshi? Where are you now?	1																					
63	63		301								Comms	...

66	66		301								Kamui	Oh, what an interesting idea!	1																					
67	67		301								Kamui	Capt?	1																					
68	68		301								Chrome	In that case, let's connect to the satellite with our portable device. Go wake Wanshi up, Kamui.	2																					
69	69		301								Kamui	Connecting to the satellite!	1
