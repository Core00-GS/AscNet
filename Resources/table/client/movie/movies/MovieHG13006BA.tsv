8	8		301								Noan	...Commandant?	1																					
9	9		301								Noan	Commandant... You can't stay here too long. You should rest in your own lounge, or Gray Raven's preparation room.	1																					
10	10		301									He tries to wake the commandant up again, but nothing happens.

14	14		301									He is about to go back to Gray Raven's preparation room, but the terminal suddenly rings. The vibration causes it to slip out of the human's hand.																						
15	15		204							1	16																							
16	16		301									Noan can guess who is calling without answering the call. The commandant called a sick leave but is still not back. There must be a lot of people worrying.

30	30		301									The person on his back is breathing calmly.																						
31	31		301									Compared with him, the human's body is soft and warm, trembling as he walks forward. A few hairs are scratching against his ear.

35	35		301									He checks again, but the human has no signs of waking up.																						
36	36		301									Have you been too exhausted lately?																						
37	37		301									Are you sleeping so deep because you haven't relaxed for a long time?																						
38	38		301									Or...																						
39	39		204							1	16																							
40	40		301								Noan	...Are you really not scared of me?	1																					
41	41		301									Ever since he started to use the "Noan" name again, many troubles have come back to him, making his awkward situation in Babylonia even worse.																						
42	42		301									Which makes him fall back to the same state he had a few years ago.																						
43	43		301									Noan knows it is not good, but whenever he is questioned or avoided by others, he would smile and try to change the topic out of instinct.																						
44	44		301								Noan	It's been many years since I left the cargo team...	1																					
45	45		301									Life in Asslam was harsh, but he could rely on others without being on guard. This peace of mind had always been his best way to relax.																						
46	46		301									Like a wanderer in the night finally seeing a familiar light, he feels a nostalgic, calming emotion.																						
47	47		301									If only he can stay a little longer in this relaxed moment. If only he can keep one person that is willing to trust him in this strange and lonely environment.																						
48	48		301									He wants to stay with true friends and find his honesty, sincerity, and kindness back.																						
49	49		301									Lillian once asked him when he just arrived in Babylonia...
