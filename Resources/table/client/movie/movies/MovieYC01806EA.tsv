10	10		301									Seeing the oncoming attack, Lucia leaps into the air and slices down through the approaching Corrupted. With the failure of the Corrupted's attack, Lee's gunfire penetrates their memory shells, giving them no further opportunity to attack.																						
11	11		301									Lucia kneels on the ground to stabilize her frame. All of the Corrupted that had attacked this area are now paralyzed at her feet.

29	29		301									Blades and bullets fly in the factory as Corrupted debris piles up behind.																						
30	30		301									As if aware of the incoming threat, the factory's assembly line begins to rapidly increase Corrupted production. A newly manufactured horde of Corrupted pours out like a flood of steel from the assembly line, destroying everything in their wake.																						
31	31		302								Stop them from spreading to other areas.	32																						
32	32		301									After receiving your order, Lucia and Lee rush forward and attempt to stop the massive horde of Corrupted, but a single team is powerless in their attempt to stymie the flood.

51	51		301								Liv	Commandant! Everyone!	2																					
52	52		301									Liv calls out loudly and presses your shoulder firmly with her hand. You struggle to ask something, only to find a pink force field gradually surrounding your body.

64	64		301									The entire area fills with the cacophonous sound of explosions and the roars of Corrupted.																						
65	65		301									The ground underfoot fractures from the blasts, then disintegrates from the next beam of white light. You temporarily feel suspended in space and time as the surrounding area is filled with white light.

83	83		301									In response to the call, you instinctively raise your right hand, but feel something hard.																						
84	84		301									Perhaps the sudden movement had caused the rock fragments near your hand to slide down with a clear and delicate clatter.

112	112		301									The three of you fall silent. All that remains of the factory is a disarray of ruins scattered throughout the surrounding area.																						
113	113		301									The towering buildings were flattened; the foundation blasted askew. Everyone knew that the chance of surviving such a bombing was grim.

134	133		301								Vanessa	It shouldn't have been used here, but because of your mistakes, I had no choice but to use my precious orbital bombardment.	1																					
135	134		301								Vanessa	Hmph. You should thank me. After all, I cleaned up your mess before you could cause any irreparable damage.	1																					
136	135		301								Vanessa	First, you don't thank me. Now, the three of you are looking at me in disgust.	1

160	158		301								Vanessa	What made you become like this? The Punishing Virus?	1																					
161	159		301								Vanessa	Oh, right. As your former classmate, I have a small suggestion.	1																					
162	160		301								Vanessa	Resign as a commandant. Leave the front line and never return.	1																					
163	161		301								Vanessa	The battlefield isn't suitable for naive fools like you.	1																					
164	162		301								Vanessa	Deception, exploitation, abandonment... These are the laws of victory on the battlefield.	1																					
165	163		301								Vanessa	Stay in Babylonia. Work as a liaison officer or logistics personnel for Egret.	1																					
166	164		301								Vanessa	You can also use Egret's resources that used to belong to Liv before we kicked her.	1
