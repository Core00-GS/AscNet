8	8		301							1		The staff-attired personnel walk in and out of the room, carrying boxes of various sizes. A gorgeous-looking Construct in pink walks up.																						
9	9		301								Ayla	—Liv, here you are! I'm so, so sorry for taking up the space in your lounge!	2																					
10	10		301								Liv	I-it's okay... But, eh, are we... moving?	1																					
11	11		301									Looking at the piles of cardboard boxes in the room, Liv is understandably confused.																						
12	12		204							2	1																							
13	13		301								Ayla	Of course not! C'mon, Liv, check this out! I'm sure you'll find it interesting!	2

15	15		301									Ayla puts her arm around Liv as she speaks and gestures toward the door theatrically.																						
16	16		301									As if on cue, the door slowly opens to reveal... an enormous, lush, emerald tree planted in an extravagant planter.																						
17	17		201							1	1031001	7																						
18	18		301							1	Liv	That's... just...	1																					
19	19		201							1	500026																							
20	20		301							1	Lee	Indeed, that's just a silver wattle, a common evergreen tree in the genus Acacia of the Fabaceae family. It prefers sunlight instead of shade, so I'd suggest putting it in a garden instead of our lounge...	1																					
21	21		301									Lee appears out of nowhere, his arms crossed. It seems like the boxes have taken over his desk and covered him entirely.																						
22	22		201							1	500110																							
23	23		301							1	Ayla	Lee, you know your plants!	1																					
24	24		301									Ayla grins, completely ignoring Lee's complaint.																						
25	25		301								Ayla	Then you should also know that a silver wattle is excellent as a—	1

28	28		301							1	Lee	If that's what you're after, you should have used the one in the genus Abies of the Abietoideae subfamily under the Pinales order—	2																					
29	29		301								Ayla	Stop nitpicking! I've spent a lot of effort moving this tree from the botanic garden to here!	1																					
30	30		204							2	10																							
31	31		301								Lee	It doesn't seem like you've spent much effort at all.	2																					
32	32		301								Ayla	Oh, c'mon, I did spend a lot of money on it!	1																					
33	33		301									Ayla's hand gently strokes the tree, rustling its beautiful, lush leaves. It is hard to imagine how much she must have paid to take it out of the Babylonia garden during a post-apocalypse.

35	35		301							1	Liv	Ayla, you can't be...	2																					
36	36		204							1	2																							
37	37		301								Ayla	That's right! It's a Christmas present for your commandant from me. I want to decorate it and turn it into a proper, festive Christmas tree!	1																					
38	38		301								Liv	Oh my... This year's Christmas tree?	2																					
39	39		301								Ayla	But I'd require your assistance.	1																					
40	40		204							2	6																							
41	41		301								Liv	B-but you're a member of the WGAA. Decorating would be your expertise, not ours...	2																					
42	42		301								Ayla	That is true, but I'm no expert in who your commandant is... Unlike you.	1																					
43	43		301								Ayla	Lee's right. This is just a common silver wattle for now—but when you adorn it with all the gifts everyone's preparing for your commandant, it'll become a gorgeous Christmas Tree filled with love!	1																					
44	44		201							2	500026		-400																					
45	45		301							1	Lee	I don't think it'll make any difference giving our presents to the commandant ourselves or hanging them on a tree...	2																					
46	46		301								Ayla	Which means you have prepared a present for the commandant, haven't you?	1																					
47	47		204							2	6

52	52		301								Liv	Actually... I've also prepared Christmas gifts for everyone...	1																					
53	53		301								Liv	You have all done so much to show me a good time last Christmas... I also want the Gray Ravens and everybody I know to experience the same joy this year...	1																					
54	54		301									Liv stutters as she speaks, her face flushing from her candid confession.																						
55	55		201							1	500110																							
56	56		301							1	Ayla	...Liv!	1																					
57	57		301									Ayla squeals, charmed and delighted, as she goes up and hugs Liv affectionately.																						
58	58		301								Ayla	You sweet thing! Ugh!	1																					
59	59		201							1	1031001	6																						
60	60		301							1	Liv	A-Ayla...	1																					
61	61		301									Liv raises her arms in Ayla's embrace, dumbfounded by the unexpected compliments.

63	63		301							1	Lucia	Ayla... Guys, what are you doing?	1																					
64	64		301									Lucia has been standing by the door for who knows how long.

66	66		201							2	500110		400																					
67	67		301							1	Ayla	We're planning for the Christmas Tree Dress-up Time!	2																					
68	68		301								Lucia	Is that a codename for a new operation?	1																					
69	69		301								Ayla	That's right! A new operation to celebrate the Gray Raven Commandant!	2																					
70	70		204							1	5																							
71	71		301									Hearing her explanation, Lucia's eyes glow, and her tone becomes extremely serious.																						
72	72		301								Lucia	In that case, please let me take part in it as well!	1																					
73	73		301								Ayla	Sure thing!	2																					
74	74		202							1	2				1																			
75	75		301									Ayla pulls Lucia in with her other hand for a hug.																						
76	76		201							1	500026	10																						
77	77		301							1	Lee	This is...	1																					
78	78		301									Lee lets out a silent sigh before turning away and heading to the door.

83	83		301							1	Lee	Aren't we getting help from the others as well?	1																					
84	84		301								Lee	I'm just going to notify the people who are most definitely getting invited.	1
