8	8		301								Karenina	We'll see.	1																					
9	9		302								Where are you heading, Karenina?	10	Is that...?	10																				
10	10		301								Bianca	Karen just got a purifying order from the headquarters. She's preparing to move out.	2																					
11	11		301								Bianca	Seeing that the commandant is here, why don't you report your leave yourself...	2																					
12	12		301								Karenina	You can take care of that for me, Bianca. I'm out!	1

15	100		301							1	Bianca	Wait, Karen!	2																					
16	15		302								Did I do something that made her mad?	18	I feel like I should have approved her leave first.	16																				
17	16		301								Bianca	You're right, Commandant. But Karen usually got her mission from the headquarters directly.	2																					
18	17	19	301								Bianca	They would be above your clearance level.	2																					
19	18		301								Bianca	Karenina is like that to everyone. It's most definitely not your fault, Commandant.	2																					
20	19		301								Bianca	Although... they did think Karen is better suited for that mission, didn't they...	2																					
21	20		302								Aren't you suitable as well?	21	Do you want to go as well?	22																				
22	21	23	301								Bianca	Perhaps. I might be the captain, but compared to me, Karenina seems to fit in the Purifying Force even more.	2																					
23	22		301								Bianca	That's not it. I'm just reflecting on my approach.	2																					
24	23		301								Bianca	Karen would initiate an attack on the target directly in an attempt to finish the mission as soon as possible.	2																					
25	24		301								Bianca	While I would investigate from multiple fronts without making a judgment call until the very last moment.	2																					
26	25		301								Bianca	Maybe that was why they thought I was unsuitable for this mission.	2																					
27	26		302								I think your approach is the right one.	27	I thought the Purifying Force wouldn't care about evidence.	28																				
28	27	29	301								Bianca	But the Purifying Force doesn't need this kind of mercy.	2																					
29	28		301								Bianca	That's just me.	2																					
30	29		301								Bianca	Do you know what they call me in the Purifying Force, Commandant?	2																					
31	30		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Bianca	Fence sitter That's what they say.	2
