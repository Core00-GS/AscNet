4	4		301									After Liv performed basic maintenance, he recovered most of his ability to participate in a new rescue mission.																						
5	5		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Unable to return to Babylonia, the Constructs have become entrenched in a war of attrition. Issues caused by the damage to their frames and lack of maintenance chambers are beginning to wear on them.

7	7		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						People are still huddled in the cold and damp basement of the conservation area, craning their necks and waiting for a sound from the outside.																						
8	8		301									They look forward to new development, whether that be news of the Punishing concentration decreasing; rescue or supplies to be arranged for their own conservation area, or for newly rescued refugees to be sent to other conservation areas.																						
9	9		301									—So long as no more refugees would come, any news is eagerly awaited.																						
10	10		301									But disappointment was accompanied by hunger and sickness for the 164 people crowded in this enclosed basement.																						
11	11		301									In addition, there are also ten Constructs and two commandants.																						
12	12		301									Aside from the three Constructs and Commandant 【kuroname】 of Gray Raven, Bambinata, and Commandant Vanessa of Egret, the six remaining Constructs were the only few survivors from previous rescue attempts.																						
13	13		301									Of these six Constructs, all but two are seriously injured. The other four had already recovered mobility under Liv's care.																						
14	14		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					They had joined search and rescue attempts in the surrounding area, but as time passed, fewer and fewer refugees could be found.

30	30		301								Liv	All of them?	2																					
31	31		301								Lee	Yes, just like Vanessa had predicted. The twins have left nothing but destruction in their wake as they've gone up the west coast.	1																					
32	32		301								Lee	During this period, they walked from Pulia Forest to the west coast, then up north, and stayed several days near the ARU.	1																					
33	33		301								Lee	Instead of entering the ARU, they redirected their route to the southeastern coast... that is, the Pulia Forest Park Ruins, and returned here.	1																					
34	34		301								Lee	At present, the twins have arrived near City 041. If they choose to return to Pulia Forest, that should bode well for us, considering that City 043 isn't near City 040.	1																					
35	35		301								Lee	If they decide to enter City 042, their next target might be here.	1

243	243		301									The refugee, referred to as Quina, begrudgingly swallows his retort. Glaring at Liv, he rolls down his sleeves, holds his red fist with the other hand and sits down in his corner with an angry look on his face.																						
244	244		301								Refugee Leader	No matter where they came from, these Constructs, especially this doctor with her leg injury, saved us and have taken care of us for so many days.	1																					
245	245		301								Refugee Leader	If the law of the jungle ruled the world, you wouldn't deserve to be saved. The Punishing Virus would've turned you into a piece of rotten meat to be fed to his dog.	1

263	263		301							1	Refugee Leader	Well, since you say so, I'm willing to believe you. You don't need to be quarantined. Not like we have the space anyway. I accept your proposal. What does everyone else think?	1

293	293		301									He bows humbly and carefully thanks Liv once again in fear of saying something wrong.																						
294	294		301								Liv	Everything's fine. Don't worry. Takes a lot of courage to look after that little guy in a place like this.	2																					
295	295		301								Liv	Not to mention, you and Matches have already had your fair share of hunger and suffering... I'm sure you guys can tough it out just a little longer.	2

301	301		301								Liv	Oh, right...	2																					
302	302		301									She takes out a tattered bag stained with blood. Inside, it contains dry military rations.

304	304		301								Liv	This was supposed to be for our commandant.	2																					
305	305		301								Liv	But the seal was broken during our retreat. It's about to expire.	2																					
306	306		301								Liv	Mind if I give it to Matches?	2																					
307	307		301								Stanley	Really? Thank you so much!	1

319	319		301								Stanley	She's a doctor! She needs to keep her hands sanitized. There are not enough supplies for that. We can't be a burden on them...	1																					
320	320		201							1	500412		400																					
321	321		301									Matches' perky ears and head droop suddenly as if he understands.

323	323		301								Stanley	It's okay. Don't worry.	1																					
324	324		301									The boy appears skittish, likely due to frequently being ostracized. Seeing Liv take out a bandage and disinfectant, the boy rolls up his pants, exposing a festering wound from corruption, and begins helping Liv.																						
325	325		301									Is the boy's personality because of Matches?																						
326	326		301								Liv	...Stanley. If the situation continues to get worse... What are you going to do?	2																					
327	327		301									He looks down in silence.																						
328	328		301								Stanley	I get what you mean, Miss Liv.	1																					
329	329		301								Stanley	I know animals can't be corrupted by the Punishing Virus, they can only carry it. So... I thought about releasing Matches into the wild.	1																					
330	330		301								Stanley	But he's already used to living with humans even before I met him. If I let him go... The next time he sees another human, he might get attacked again.	1																					
331	331		201							1	500411		400																					
332	332		301							1	Stanley	I know I'm being selfish... But I need Matches by my side. He's the only thing keeping me going.	1																					
333	333		301								Stanley	So, I'll just keep him with me. If I ever run out of supplies, I'll abandon myself—not Matches.	1																					
334	334		301								Liv	...Do you even realize what you just said?	2																					
335	335		301								Stanley	Thank you, Miss Liv.	1																					
336	336		301									He refrains from answering. Instead, he just sincerely thanks her one last time.																						
337	337		301								Liv	...	2																					
338	338		301									Every person wandering these lands has turmoil uniquely their own.																						
339	339		301									It's useless even to ask. The only way to resolve their suffering is to restore Earth to its vitality. Anything else would only temporarily delay the pain.																						
340	340		301									But this goal is too far away. People have no choice but to immerse themselves in daily life.																						
341	341		301									In order not to open up old wounds and delay the pain, Liv refrains from pushing the question.																						
342	342		301									She just adeptly disinfects and bandages Stanley's wound, then injects him with serum.																						
343	343		301									As long as there's something that can be improved, that's the best consolation at this moment.																						
344	344		301								Liv	Your corruption won't get any worse as long as you stay here in the enclosed basement.	2																					
345	345		301								Liv	And also...	2																					
346	346		204							2	5																							
347	347		301								Liv	Since you aren't willing to let Matches go, you need to keep living... Got it?	2																					
348	348		301								Liv	Don't be going around saying you'll abandon yourself so casually. It's just like you said, you depend on Matches and Matches depends on you.	2																					
349	349		301								Stanley	Okay...	1																					
350	350		202							1	2				1																			
351	351		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Mentioning Matches, the boy's voice becomes softer. He thanks Liv again, snuggles up with Matches, and quickly falls asleep.
