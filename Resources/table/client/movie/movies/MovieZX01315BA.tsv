4	3		301			DialogEnable						Hello there, friend.																						
5	4		301									Ah, forget it, "friend." What nonsense it is. By now, you should have already realized that this is just a madman's ravings with an imaginary friend.																						
6	5		301									Have you ever wondered what it would be like, on the day you die?																						
7	6		301									I might die at any time. I'm close enough to "that place," so there's no need for me to hide anymore.																						
8	7		301									Strangely, I don't have any resentment about it.																						
9	8		301									When those people were after me, I ran like a rat prodded by some hot metal rod.																						
10	9		301									When Roland burned the research facility to the ground, I was cowering like a child.																						
11	10		301									When I learned that it was the Godfather who betrayed me, though, I instead felt nothing.																						
12	11		301									Maybe it's true what their leader, the little girl, said... that humans are weak, vile, unworthy of trust. That must be the case.																						
13	12		301									—I finally feel like things are about to come to an end.																						
14	13		301									But I must apologize, my friend, this story of mine... It's not some thrilling tale.																						
15	14		301									Only now, do I realize that I am nothing but a coward. A coward that, even to kill a man, I need someone to place the knife in my hand.																						
16	15		301									Hello, friend. I guess this is goodbye.																						
17	16		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					I've never made proper farewells before. So allow me, my imaginary friend, allow me a proper farewell.

22	19		201							1	500105																							
23	20		301							1	Luna	...So, how was your last supper?	1																					
24	21		301								Luna	Ah, I must have forgotten. You're no longer human. You don't require food.	1																					
25	22		301								Shome	...																						
26	23		301								Luna	Have you bid your farewells to family and friends?	1																					
27	24		301								Luna	...Ah, I jest. You have no family or friends.	1																					
28	25		301								Shome	...																						
29	26		301								Luna	He who has nothing, did you at least have a good, last night's sleep?	1																					
30	27		301								Shome	...																						
31	28		301									Luna shakes her head in face of Shome's silence.																						
32	29		301								Luna	Pitiful child.	1																					
33	30		301								Luna	Even the last day of your life is in such misery.	1																					
34	31		301								Shome	You're not after what I know, are you? You went to all this trouble looking for me, not because you're trying to know something.																						
35	32		301								Shome	You knew from the beginning. You only wanted my death.																						
36	33		301								Luna	...	1																					
37	34		301								Luna	Yes, I don't care at all. Not a sliver.	1																					
38	35		301								Shome	...Why?																						
39	36		301								Luna	...Why, indeed?	1																					
40	37		301								Luna	Perhaps it's because of your impudence. That merciful agent protected you by making you an Ascendant, but instead, you squandered your hard-earned rebirth, marching into territories not yours to tread.	1																					
41	38		301								Luna	I hope your death will make others agents realize, that humans are not worth saving.	1

44	41		301							1	Gabriel	Miss, the info backup he scattered in various parts of the theme park have been found and destroyed.	1																					
45	42		301								Gabriel	The execution can begin at anytime.	1																					
46	43		301								Shome	Just that?																						
47	44		301								Shome	That's what you people want? To take the Ascension-Network, all for your own?																						
48	45		301								Gabriel	How dare you, mere mortal! Guessing at the will of Miss Luna!	1																					
49	46		202							1																								
50	47		201							1	500105																							
51	48		301							1	Luna	Thank you, Gabriel.	1																					
52	49		301								Luna	Looking at the time, ours guests should be arriving soon...	1																					
53	50		202							1																								
54	51		201							1	500101																							
55	52		301							1	Gabriel	Indeed. They are close.	1																					
56	53		202							1																								
57	54		201							1	500105																							
58	55		301							1	Luna	So, any last words?	1																					
59	56		301								Shome	...Just what are you waiting for?																						
60	57		301								Luna	Ah, what am I waiting for, indeed?	1																					
61	58		301								Luna	Don't worry, it's not what you are waiting for, that's for certain.	1																					
62	59		301								Luna	Lamia?	1																					
63	60		301									An X-shaped shadow squirms quickly near Luna. Space distorts, and a figure materializes out of thin air.

75	72		301							1	Luna	Good girl.	2																					
76	73		301									In appreciation, or perhaps out of mere amusement, Luna stretches out a hand and gently pats Lamia's face.																						
77	999004		204							1	8																							
78	74		301								Lamia	M-M-Miss Luna...	1																					
79	75		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Luna	Good work. You did well. Step back and wait for everything to end.	2

82	77		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You step into the plaza, only to see...																						
83	82		301									...The remains of a certain Construct, scattered all over the plaza. A massive figure, with his back facing you, is admiring a huge bionic statue in front.																						
84	999003		301									As if sensing your arrival, the figure turns toward you—																						
85	84		201							1	500101

104	102		301							1	Luna	Yes.	1																					
105	103		301							1	Luna	This is our own problem. We'll deal with it ourselves.	1																					
106	104		301									With that, the massive cartoonish statue behind them suddenly begins to transform.

109	107		301							1	Shome	...Speare?																						
110	110		301								Luna	You ran here last for this statue... Ah, no this is a mere holo-projection. You are here for the real Shark-speare underneath it.																						
111	111		301								Luna	Shark-speare, the defense robot made in the image of an animation from your childhood.

119	119		301								Luna	I hope this makes you feel better on your way to hell.																						
120	129		301							1		A shadow flies out of the holo-projection and prances slowly to Shome.

129	509		301					500			Shome	ARRRGGH!!!																						
130	130		301									Almost instantly, the shadow pulls Shome back into the holo-projection and returns.																						
131	131		301									A rumble of mechanical screeches ring out from within. Crushing, fracturing, masticating—at something.																						
132	132		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					No screams. No cries. Only chewing. Fluids and gears fall near the statue's feet.
