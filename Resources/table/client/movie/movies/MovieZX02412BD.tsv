4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Sailor	I sometimes wonder if the traveler truly existed.	1																					
5	5		301									The first time I noticed that traveler, it wasn't because of her stories but her singing voice.																						
6	6		301								Sailor	The siren's call.	1																					
7	7		301								Sailor	What is the most beautiful singing voice that you've ever heard? And where did you hear it?	1

13	13		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The girl stands on the stern and sings. Her angelic voice is like the whispers of a holy spirit, more impressive than what Vainamoinen himself could conjure.																						
14	14		301									The song is harmonic with the vast ocean. It is the second half of the soothing aria. It is the joy of a lonely whale drowning in the depth of the ocean that finally finds where it belongs. And it is the most glorious ode one can sing for the vast sea when they first see it.																						
15	15		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Everything looks too beautiful to be real. The girl stands alone as if a lone island surrounded by miracles.

17	17		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						How can she still sing?																						
18	18		301									Pandora's box has clearly been opened and plunged the world into chaos. Abhorrent ugliness and evils inside the box were set loose, whether those bad things came from the world to humanity or the other way around.																						
19	19		301									How can she still celebrate the vastness of the sea?																						
20	20		301									The gray currents are often deadly.																						
21	21		301									How can she still smile when she sees the starry sky?																						
22	22		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					There is clearly only silence and perhaps ashes of a universe that is already dead.

26	26		301								???	It is a view never seen before.	1																					
27	27		301									The pair of eyes stares at everything beautiful about this world.

29	29		301									Is it innocence?																						
30	30		301									The girl sounds serious and looks determined.

32	32		301							1	???	I want to find the magic that can kill this evil dragon.	1																					
33	33		301									When she pulls down her hood and hides her face, yet still decides to extend a helping hand to others...																						
34	34		301									When she shares her last remaining supplies with the orphans who steal...

41	41		301									Yet, there is still some wisdom and reason behind it.																						
42	42		301									There are only helpless survivors on the boat, which sails alone on the vast sea.																						
43	43		301									Some people are panicking, some are furious, and some have given up.																						
44	44		201							1	500431																							
45	45		301									The young traveler recalls what she read from the navigation books back in the library. She operates a simple device to calculate their position on the sea.																						
46	46		301									The gambler who has no chance of winning takes over the steering wheel of fate and turns the compass in the direction where the girl is pointing at.																						
47	47		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The sun starts to set. As the people gaze into the distance, traces of land are revealed on the horizon. What lies ahead is unknown.
