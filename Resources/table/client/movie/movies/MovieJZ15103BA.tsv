12	12		301							1	Camu	What are you people doing? Start collecting our things!	2																					
13	13		301									Camu's squad is sent on a new mission to transport some packages for Kurono.																						
14	14		301									Like their supplies, the items are sent to them via airdrop. The packages are heavily bundled up and come with small filters, perhaps for secrecy or other reasons.																						
15	15		301									While receiving their shipment, Camu's squad is attacked by a Corrupted horde.																						
16	16		301								Soldier A	Oh, yeah... Come help, everyone...	1																					
17	17		301				DialogDisable					As the other members come back to their senses and are about to help with the supplies, a scream rings out right next to Camu.

22	22		301			DialogEnable	RImgBg1Shake				Soldier	Ahhhhhhhh!																						
23	23		301								Camu	Hey! What's wrong?																						
24	24		301									The screams increase in volume. The soldier is lying face-down on the ground, scratching at his own arms and neck.																						
25	25		301									His face turns purple. As if suffocating, he starts struggling to pull off his protective gear in attempt to breathe better.																						
26	26		301								Camu	Stop! Taking off your gear here? Are you off your rocker?																						
27	27		301								Soldier	Ahhhhh! It hurts... And so itchy...																						
28	28		301				RImgBg1Shake				Soldier	Aaaaaaaahhhh!																						
29	29		301									The squad members surround the screamer, trying to figure out what is going on, while Camu keeps shaking him in hopes of keeping him calm.																						
30	30		301								Camu	Where are you hurting? Were you injured in the battle? Or are you sick?																						
31	31		301								Soldier	Aaaahhhh! I don't know... don't know, Camu!																						
32	32		301									His whole body is in pain and drastically weakened. It is as if lava is churning in his brain.																						
33	33		301									The man manages to spit out a few words as he writhes on the ground. Camu touches his body and senses a strong heat radiating from his skin.																						
34	34		301								Camu	Oh, right... the serum! Someone fetch the serum!																						
35	35		301								Soldier A	Got it! Give him a shot now!																						
36	36		301									Some other members had already gone off to fetch the serum before Camu's shout, as this is not the first time something like this has happened.																						
37	37		301									Though they have no idea what the reason is, squad members would sometimes suddenly fall down in excruciating pain and lose all control over their limbs.																						
38	38		301									Kurono's response to situations like this is always: "More serum."																						
39	39		301									But the official solution did not seem to work this time. They give the soldier the shot, but things do not take a turn for the better.																						
40	40		301								Soldier	Camu... Camu...																						
41	41		301								Camu	What?																						
42	42		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Soldier	Ugh... we... we're real unlucky, huh...

51	51		301							1		According to the contract they signed, all bodies of squad members must be returned to Kurono. Along with the delivery, Camu brings his dead squadmate there.																						
52	52		301								Camu	I'm here to make a delivery... yet you won't even let me into the city?	1																					
53	53		301								Guard	It's part of the contract. Don't try to force your way in, or we'll shoot.	2																					
54	54		301									Camu is held up at the gate while his "packages" are brought into the city right away.																						
55	55		301								Camu	Yeah, I know you'll shoot. Anyway, what's happened to this dude? If you guys want the body, it means you'll give him an autopsy, right?	1																					
56	56		301								Guard	I said don't move!	2																					
57	57		401							2	1511																							
58	58		301								Camu	What's happening?	1																					
59	59		301									Camu notices that the guards are on high alert—not because of the contractual obligations, but a sort of instinctive reaction.																						
60	60		301									With every step Camu takes towards the guard, he takes one step back and clutches his weapon tighter.																						
61	61		301									It was the same when they took in the body. Those people seemed disproportionately nervous, as if Camu was handing over an explosive.																						
62	62		301								Camu	Tell me what you know.	1																					
63	63		401							2	1510																							
64	64		301									Clenching his fist, Camu marches towards the guards, who immediately open fire without bothering to issue a warning according to the rules.																						
65	65		301								Guard	Dammit! Told you to stay back!	2																					
66	66		301								Camu	Tch...	1

69	69		301									Camu knows better than to cause a scene here, so he gives up his questioning attempt and backs up, finally fleeing the city amidst gunfire.																						
70	70		401							2	1504																							
71	71		301									What happened to his squadmate? And what do the Kurono guards know?																						
72	72		301									What will happen to him and the other squad members?																						
73	73		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The questions still plague Camu's mind.

77	77		301								Mao Zhen	Mao Zhen speaking. The "monsters" have left the city.	1																					
78	78		301									...																						
79	79		301								Mao Zhen	It's only been a short time since these models have been employed in operations before the "accidental" deaths began. I'm truly regretful.	1																					
80	80		301								Mao Zhen	And the deaths have become increasingly frequent. Our "monsters" might not have much time left.	1																					
81	81		301								Mao Zhen	So we should just go ahead without any ado, huh? Got it. How about we send them to "that place", then?	1
