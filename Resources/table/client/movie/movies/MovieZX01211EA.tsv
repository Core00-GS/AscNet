9	6		301									Her blade dances in the air amid a crescendo of anguished moans. Upon sheathing the blade, Alpha kicks Lucia onto the ground.																						
10	7		302								(Catch Lucia)	8																						
11	8		301									Ignoring the danger around, you dash forward and catch the nigh-broken Lucia in your arms.																						
12	9		301								Lucia	Cough...	1																					
13	10		301									Your arms do not manage to mitigate the fall. A cloud of dust is whipped up from the impact.																						
14	11		301								Lucia	Ah... Commandant...	1																					
15	12		301									A quick check on Lucia's condition confirms your worries—she has been damaged beyond repair.																						
16	13		301									Her body has been completely mangled by the slashes. An intricate mass of mechanical fiber and circulation liquid oozes out of Lucia's frame uncontrollably.																						
17	14		302								Are you okay?	15	Don't talk.	16																				
18	15	17	301								Lucia	My voice module is still functional... I managed to... protect my core components.	1																					
19	16		301								Lucia	But then... how could I answer you...?	1																					
20	17		301									Though her lower torso is already sliced off, Lucia is still trying to shift over, lifting her head to eke out a smile for you.																						
21	18		301									...Just like how she pushes herself, as always.

35	32		301									You have your next move in mind, but none of you are any match for Alpha. It would be nigh-impossible for the Gray Raven squad to extract out of this place. Even so—

38	35		301							1	Luna	Sister, can you let her go?	1																					
39	36	631	301									From the Corrupted horde afore the bridge emerges a girl, white-haired and tufted with a pair of voluminous twin-tails. She reminds you of Alpha.																						
40	631	37	401							1	207																							
41	37		301									"Luna..."																						
42	38		301									Lucia—uncertain of which—speaks her name. You and the others realize that this girl in white is the leader of the Ascendants.																						
43	39		301								Luna	I'm... unsure if I've introduced myself before, but it doesn't matter. As trivial as you all are, you have treated my sister well.	1																					
44	40		301								Luna	My name is Luna, Lucia's younger sister. I direct the actions of Roland and the other Ascendants.	1																					
45	41		301									Saying so, Luna lets off a half-smile that sends chills down your spine. This white-clad girl before you looks straight out of a fairytale.																						
46	42		301									Despite standing directly before you, she appears dreamier and more unreal than anything in the world.																						
47	43		301								Luna	As for the other details... I'm sure you've all gleaned information about me through various means.	1																					
48	44		302								Are you really Lucia's younger sister?	45	All the things the Ascendants have done so far...	47																				
49	45		301								Luna	Are you asking if Lucia has a younger sister? Or if I'm truly her younger sister?	1																					
50	46	48	301								Luna	Well, the question to both answers is yes. I... am Lucia's younger sister.	1																					
51	47		301								Luna	Some of them acted on their own, but most of them operated on my orders.	1																					
52	48	611	301								Luna	Though... How laughable this is. Me, introducing myself to a commandant...	1

56	50	52	301								Luna	Well, well... What for, indeed?	1																					
57	51		301								Luna	If you're trying to talk me out of this... save your breath. You will not change my mind even if you hold my sister hostage.	1																					
58	52		301							1	Lucia	Luna... the sister I remembered... Why? Why are you an Ascendant?	2																					
59	53		301								Luna	I wish I could answer that as well, Sister.	1																					
60	54		301								Luna	You're still struggling for what you believe in, even when you're one foot in the grave.	1																					
61	55		301								Luna	So I'm asking you, Sister, can you spare "yourself" a chance?	1

70	64		301								Lucia	Luna... you...	2																					
71	68	82	301								Luna	You may be just a replica, but you're still my sister. Now let me...	1																					
72	82		301									Like a benevolent executioner, Luna raises her hand and extracts something out of her body. It crystallizes into a small cube on her palm.

80	89		301									Sensing danger from the cube, you pull the trigger in a knee jerk reaction, but the bullet does not connect with the target—																						
81	90		301									Instead, it freezes in the air before Luna.

92	100		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The moment Luna approaches Lucia, a row of javelins plummets from the sky and cleanly separates the Ascendants from you. The voice is familiar, but you find it difficult to recall its owner in the heat of the moment.																						
93	101		301									And before you know it, the person has already placed herself between you and the Ascendants.																						
94	102		301								???	Gray Raven, take Lucia and leave! We'll handle things from here!
