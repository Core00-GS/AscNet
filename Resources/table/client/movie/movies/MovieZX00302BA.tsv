5	4		301								Liv	This is the Museum Estateâ€”the final station of Rail 11 of City 015. The Ascendant traces ended here.	1																					
6	5		302								A museum?	6	What's the corruption situation here?	10																				
7	6		301								Liv	Yes. According to the records, this was an estate privately owned by a business magnate of the Transatlantic Economic Community, back in the Golden Age.	1																					
8	7		301								Liv	This person has a liking to collection, especially bionic machines. This museum of machines was once open for viewing even for normal citizens.	1

10	9	14	301							1	Lee	I've heard of this before as well. Bionic research was one of the more well-developed fields back then, and various animal replications were made.	1																					
11	10		301								Liv	Commandant! According to the worldwide viral density distribution mappings of the past years, this area has stayed in a low to medium degree of density for a long period of time.	1																					
12	11		301								Liv	And according to the scans just now, active Corrupted nearby are also scarce.	1

14	13		301							1	Lee	So at least, this shouldn't be the enemy's nest.	1

16	15		301							1	Liv	This Museum Estate has Anti-Punishing Virus measures built in since the Post-Pandemic Age, and has acted as a shelter facility until the end of the "Great Withdrawal".	1

18	17		301							1	Lucia	Though the viral density is lower here than in City 015, we've still been receiving distress signals from recon squads. The enemies here are not just the Corrupted...	1																					
19	18		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Ascendant powers are still an unknown factor, we must be careful.	1
