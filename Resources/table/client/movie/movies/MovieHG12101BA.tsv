35	35		301								Commandant C	That model number sounds familiar. Is it that white Construct from Cerberus...? What's she called...	3																					
36	36		301								Commandant A	Cerberus... Those "Rabid Dogs" are an experimental combat team. I heard their commandant is a fella who can't fight boots on the ground and relies solely on remote M.I.N.D. connections.	1																					
37	37		301								Commandant B	Remote links? But once a connection is severed, that'll overload the Construct and take forever to re-calibrate. No wonder they're asking for emergency ground support.	2																					
38	38		301								Commandant C	Once, I was on a recovery mission in the same area as Cerberus. Their way of fighting...	3

62	62		301									As if throwing fatigue and emotions into the wind, the Construct commands her Co-Bot to relentless attack the already indistinguishable remains of Corrupted.																						
63	63		301									You can tell at a glance that the Construct is beyond reasoning with. If she doesn't calm down soon, she may overload her M.I.N.D. due to being unable to control her power.

142	142		301									Perhaps it was from the commandant's words and emotions, both of which were foreign to her, that had been shared over the link.																						
143	143		301									Perhaps it was human instinct that made it seem so important.
