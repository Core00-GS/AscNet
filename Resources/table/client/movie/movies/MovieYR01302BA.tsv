10	10		301							1	Roland	Pretty interesting, huh? Not really dead, but not alive either. In that state, how does she see herself...	1																					
11	11		301								Roland	...and see this world? I am quite interested in this.	1

13	13		301							1	Gabriel	Save the research for later. Miss Luna wants us to gather.	1

15	15		301							1	Roland	It's that one from before, right? I was just about to report to her about the Venus Splash Park.	1

26	26		301								Roland	It's as you just heard. Gabriel and I will go first. The rest of the preparations are in your hands.	1																					
27	27		301								Lamia	Preparations...?	2																					
28	28		301								Roland	I'm talking about the part that's related to Gestalt. What we have is just the "key" after all. The location of the main body is our problem.	1																					
29	29		301								Lamia	Do you have to? If you ask Lady Luna, will she answer for sure?	2																					
30	30		301								Roland	If we just wait around for the answer to be announced, we won't even know how we've died. You don't want to become like "that guy" right?	1
