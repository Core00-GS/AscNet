21	21		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Lucia	Once upon a time, an evil king was all by himself. He had the elixir of life, but he never shared it with anyone.																						
22	22		301									In the faded memory, Luna is sitting in Lucia's arms and listening to her reading a story from a magazine she found.	1																					
23	23		301								Lucia	And war broke out one day. A lot of people died.																						
24	24		301								Lucia	He went to his people and shouted, "I can share my elixir of life with you."																						
25	25		301									Lucia holds on to Luna's hand as she reads the book, rubbing the back of her hand.																						
26	26		301								Lucia	Some people said no because they didn't believe him, but some said yes because they were desperate.																						
27	27		301								Lucia	But most of the people who drank the elixir died. Those who survived had scales and horns growing out of their body. They looked like the evil king now.																						
28	28		301								Lucia	People were angry, thinking they'd been tricked. They stopped fighting amongst themselves and tried to fight the evil king and those who'd turned into monsters.																						
29	29		301								Luna	Why did they try to fight those who'd turned into monsters?																						
30	30		301								Lucia	Because those people became immortal monsters. The humans were afraid that they wouldn't be able to fight the monsters if they ever got bullied by them.																						
31	31		301								Luna	Why didn't the humans just drink the elixir themselves?																						
32	32		301								Lucia	Because they were afraid that the elixir would either kill them or turn them into monsters.																						
33	33		301								Luna	...So what happened next?																						
34	34		301								Lucia	The leader of the humans caught one of the monsters. "If you can poison the evil king's drink and kill him, I shall reward you properly," the leader politely said to the monster.																						
35	35		301								Lucia	The monster happily agreed. After the monster passed the poisoned drink to the lonely king, he drank it all with a smile on his face, because it'd been so long since he last spent time with anyone.																						
36	36		301									Lucia picks up the blanket on the floor and covers Luna with it.																						
37	37		301								Luna	Did the evil king die?																						
38	38		301								Lucia	He did, and the humans captured all the monsters. The world was all peaceful again with just humans in it. How wonderful.																						
39	39		301								Luna	But how is it wonderful? Wasn't it the humans who started the war? If they hadn't, the evil king wouldn't have decided to hand out his elixir.																						
40	40		301								Lucia	That's true, but that's how it goes in the story.																						
41	41		301								Luna	Poor evil king...																						
42	42		301								Lucia	Why? A lot of people died because of his elixir!																						
43	43		301								Luna	But he only handed out his elixir because the war had killed a lot of people, no?																						
44	44		301								Luna	Should he just sit around and hope the world would get better?																						
45	45		301									Lucia puts down the magazine. She pats Luna on the back as she thinks about Luna's question.																						
46	46		301								Lucia	But that's still not a good reason for the evil king to go around handing out his evil elixir. There has to be a different solution!																						
47	47		301								Luna	Like what?																						
48	48		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	...I don't know, but there has to be!
