4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Celica	Sir, the Gray Raven Commandant has arrived.	1																					
5	5		301									Inside the large laboratory, only Asimov is there debugging various machines.																						
6	6		302								Are you alone again?	7

9	9		301							1	Asimov	The others have gone to bed since they've been working all night.	2																					
10	10		302								What about you?	11																						
11	11		301								Asimov	...I'm not tired.	2																					
12	12		204							1	4																							
13	13		301								Celica	Asimov! I told you and your team not to overwork yourselves, remember?	1																					
14	14		301								Asimov	Sure... Anyway, remember that I entrusted you with testing the CUBs?	2																					
15	15		302								I do, but...	16																						
16	16		301								Asimov	Regarding the project, there has been some... how to say...	2																					
17	17		202							1																								
18	18		302								Sorry, I need to go. I just remembered that I've got a meeting...	19

20	20		301									The smiling Celica swiftly closes the door to the lab unexpectedly, blocking your way out.																						
21	21		201							1	500001	2	-450																					
22	22		301							1	Celica	You must've misremembered. I've checked, and you don't have any meetings today.	1																					
23	23		302								Of course you have.	24																						
24	24		204							1																								
25	25		301								Asimov	I guess I'll carry on then... We've received two pieces feedback, one of which is not good and the other is bad. Which one do you want to hear first?	2																					
26	26		302								Isn't that the same thing…?	27																						
27	27		301								Asimov	Well, not exactly. You know, the tests and preliminary data collection for the CUB are done...	2																					
28	28		302								That's good news!	29																						
29	29		301								Asimov	Sure, but we've noticed that its AI is lacking without the support of a database, so it can't adapt to complex situations on the battlefields.	2																					
30	30		301								Asimov	Though it doesn't require a perfect AI performance, some combat patterns are needed as a data reference.	2																					
31	31		302								That's tricky... but I don't think I can help.	32																						
32	32		301								Celica	Just wait and let Asimov finish what he has to say.	1																					
33	33		301								Asimov	But we can solve this by simulating encounters with different enemies in different environments—although we have already run out of time on that.	2																					
34	34		302								That's the "not good news"? What about the bad news?	35																						
35	35		301									Asimov taps the holographic projection display and refreshes the screen, and the word "Chestlefield" pops up.																						
36	36		301								Asimov	To speed up the process, we've developed "Chestlefield", a program simulating some popular tabletop games from the Golden Age. Given your experience with a CUB, we need you to carry out the test.	2																					
37	37		302								So... it's a game?	38																						
38	38		301								Asimov	Technically, you could say so.	2																					
39	39		302								Is it... safe?	40																						
40	40		301									Asimov points to the coffee in his hand.																						
41	41		301								Asimov	Safe…? It's at least safer than this cold cup of coffee.	2																					
42	42		302								That's not bad news.	43																						
43	43		301								Asimov	It's not. I haven't mentioned the bad news.	2																					
44	44		302								You haven't?	45																						
45	45		204							1	2																							
46	46		401							1	202																							
47	47		301								Asimov	The real bad news is that the main rule designer of the simulation program is the one standing beside you. Celica.	2																					
48	48		302								What?!	49	I've got to go!	49																				
49	49		204							1	5																							
50	50		301								Celica	Wait! Take a look at my design! You'll be fascinated, I promise!	1																					
51	51		301								Asimov	Just so you know, I'm only responsible for the data collection. I haven't tampered with the content of this program yet...	2																					
52	52		301								Celica	Mr. Asimov, enough talking... Sit down here, Commandant. I'll teach you how to do it!	1																					
53	53		401							2	1515																							
54	54		301									Celica pins you down with a surprisingly strong forearm and activates the test program.																						
55	55		204							1	2																							
56	56		301								Celica	I'm sure you'll enjoy it!	1																					
57	57		302		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Fingers crossed...
