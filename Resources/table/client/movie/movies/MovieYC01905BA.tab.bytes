3	3		301			DialogEnable						Bidding Roland farewell, Alpha returns to the upper level, to where she came in from.																						
4	4		301									Walking in the direction she guesses they headed in, she steps into a wrecked greenhouse.																						
5	5		201							1	500100																							
6	6		301							1	Œ±	It wasn't just Cinderelik they encountered?	1																					
7	7		202							1					1																			
8	8		301									She looks around, and judging by the indicators, a destructive brawl must have taken place here. This could not have been the work of that petite girl.																						
9	9		301									Her assessment stems not from her understanding of Cinderelik's battle style but her character. There was no way the girl would have allowed the secrets hidden here to be destroyed in a battle.																						
10	10		201							1	500100																							
11	11		301							1	Œ±	Looks like they're no longer here.	1																					
12	12		202							1					1																			
13	13		301									Stepping over the debris covering the ground, Alpha prepares to leave the greenhouse when she feels a menacing aura from behind.																						
14	14		301									She stops and grips the hilt of her katana, indicating that the person should show themselves.																						
15	15		301								???	Good observation.																						
16	16		201							1	500100	5

21	20		301							1	Vonnegut	It's been a while.	2																					
22	21		301								Œ±	It's only been a few days.	1																					
23	22		301								Vonnegut	You've been lingering around here for quite some time. Is there something you can't let go off?	2																					
24	23		301								Vonnegut	If it's because of Luna, I can promise you she's not here. But if it's Gabriel you're after...	2																					
25	24		301								Œ±	I have no interest in a piece of trash who needs to depend on Ascnet.	1																					
26	25		301								Vonnegut	Oh?	2																					
27	26		301									Hearing this, his interest piques and he appraises Alpha, who stands before him.																						
28	27		301									He quickly finds what he is looking for and nods in satisfaction.																						
29	28		301								Vonnegut	Looks like you've received an invitation from Ascnet.	2																					
30	29		301								Œ±	...	1																					
31	30		301								Vonnegut	You're not going to accept it? Becoming an agent will grant you the blessings of Ascnet, which will make your road ahead a lot smoother.	2																					
32	31		301								Œ±	It's not just blessings. Ascnet also gets you into deep trouble.	1																					
33	32		301								Vonnegut	If you're that afraid of trouble, why not just drop everything and disconnect from Ascnet.	2																					
34	33		301								Œ±	You of all people should know that once you connect to Ascnet, there's no way to disconnect on your own!	1																					
35	34		301								Vonnegut	But I heard you've received some interesting data.	2																					
36	35		301								Œ±	If you're referring to the thing Shome left behind, it's incomplete.	1																					
37	36		301								Vonnegut	What a shame. I suggested that in the hopes that you would be able to use it to stay out of trouble.	2																					
38	37		301								Œ±	...All I need is to stay away from additional trouble.	1																					
39	38		301								Œ±	My link to Ascnet is also my link to Luna. So long as I'm an Ascendant, I'll know she's still alive and safe somewhere.	1																					
40	39		301								Vonnegut	What a solid bond... To think that kinship can obstruct progress to such an extent.	2																					
41	40		301								Vonnegut	Since you're all set on finding Luna, why did you stay and let those Babylonian rats in?	2																					
42	41		301								Œ±	Why ask when you already know the answer to that?	1																					
43	42		301								Vonnegut	I was hoping you'd give me a different answer.	2																					
44	43		202							1	2				1																			
45	44		301									With a mocking expression, he walks toward the other end of the greenhouse.																						
46	45		201							1	500305																							
47	46		301							1	Vonnegut	More feed is required to grow the Red Tide. I'll take this as a token of your kindness.	1																					
48	47		301								Vonnegut	Oh yes, and while you may have no interest in Gabriel, the reverse isn't true.	1																					
49	48		301								Vonnegut	I've already repaired his frame, and he's left his knowledge of Red Tide breeding to Cinderelik.	1																					
50	49		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Vonnegut	Do you want to end your conflict once and for all here?	1

54	53		301									Alpha surveys the "old haunt" she is about to say goodbye to while waiting for Gabriel to arrive.																						
55	54		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					In this familiar environment, her thoughts take her back to the past.

59	58		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Gabriel	The military post has been destroyed, but their plan is still in motion.	1																					
60	59		301								Gabriel	This proves that their real base is hidden somewhere else.	1																					
61	60		201							1	500008																							
62	61		301							1	Roland	I found an underground laboratory in the Arctic, but the research there has nothing to do with the Ascendants. It's at most an "accumulation" of past research.	1																					
63	3002		201							1	500165																							
64	3003		301							1	Lamia	I'm quite interested in Amberia. Can I have her?																						
65	62		201							1	500238	5																						
66	63		301							1	Luna	Go ahead.	1																					
67	3004		201							1	500008																							
68	3005		301							1	Roland	And see if there are any clues we missed while you're at.	1																					
69	3006		201							1	500238	5																						
70	3007		301							1	Luna	No, as long as those people are safe and high above in paradise, they will continue to send their pawns down. No matter how many times their base is destroyed, their plan will never cease.	1																					
71	64		301								Luna	Rather than continue investigating, perhaps we should take down the root cause, Babylonia.	1																					
72	65		301									The girl looks down at the people below her seat, her usually peaceful gaze now burning with fury. Her rage throbs within the M.I.N.D., hiding the traces of pain.																						
73	66		301								Luna	Not only will this solve a long-standing problem, we'll also get more candidates for the filtering.	1																					
74	67		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Luna	After all, most of the "seeds" are in Babylonia.	1

77	70		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		What follows this decision is a bloody battle.																						
78	71		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					On the night that Huaxu is taken from Kowloong, Alpha finds Luna alone in the ruins.

82	75		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Œ±	Why did you have me let "Lucia" go?	2																					
83	76		301								Œ±	She is powerless and will only be used by others again. Why not just let me kill her right there and then?	2																					
84	77		301								Œ±	If they use the data taken from me to improve Lucia's frame, the odds against us will be greater.	2																					
85	78		301								Luna	I told you the reason.	1																					
86	79		301								Œ±	But there's a part you haven't mentioned.	2																					
87	80		301								Luna	I could say the same of you. When I wanted to make her an Ascendant, you made the same face.	1																					
88	81		301								Œ±	...	2																					
89	82		301								Luna	It's for one reason alone that I stopped you from killing her.	1																					
90	83		204							1	1																							
91	84		301								Luna	I don't want to see you regret it.	1																					
92	85		301								Œ±	...What did you say?	2																					
93	86		301								Luna	Maybe you haven't realized it yourself, Sister, but you do hold a little... just a little bit of anticipation.	1																					
94	87		301								Œ±	Anticipation?	2																					
95	88		301								Luna	Perhaps you'd like to see how far your other self, who's remained resolute in her path, can go.	1																					
96	89		301								Luna	Taking the road you've never taken on your behalf...	1																					
97	90		202							1	2				1

103	95		301								Luna	But...	1																					
104	96		301								Luna	Should she learn the truth one day and undergo the filtering...	1

121	113		301								Gabriel	If you're willing to serve the Ascension-Network again, I'll consider letting you leave for old times' sake.	2
