4	4		301									There was a wooden sign on the side of the road. The direction on the sign pointed to a castle-like building.

6	5		301							1	Vera	So are we going there to find the King and pick up quests from him?	1

8	6		301							1	Camu	So much hassle. Why don't they just tell me who to kill.	2

10	7		301							1	Karenina	I agree.	3																					
11	8		302								Perhaps we don't have to kill anyone.	9	Perhaps there will be some enemy we can't beat.	10																				
12	9	11	301								Camu	I'm going to kill the King if he gives us those weird errands quests.	2																					
13	10	11	301								Vera	Oh really? I'm keen to meet that enemy.	1																					
14	11		301									No matter what, all three of them seemed to be the "bold" type.																						
15	12		301								Vera	Why are you sighing? Are you tired, 【kuroname】?	1																					
16	13		301									Vera turned to me, pretending to be caring. But I still saw that same mocking smile on her face.																						
17	14		301								Vera	"If 【kuroname】 is tired, we'll just leave you. The system never forced us to move together."	1																					
18	15		301								Karenina	Oh, right. I went quite far away when I was scouting on my own.	3																					
19	16		301									I hadn't said anything, but they were already thinking of abandoning their teammates.																						
20	1004		302								Wait, I can walk!	17	Don't you know teammates are extremely important in role-playing games?	19																				
21	17	18	301								Vera	Good. I don't want to lose such a good shield yet.	1																					
22	18	21	301									She said shield, but I decided to just pretend as if I heard nothing.																						
23	19	20	301								Camu	Teammates? Do you mean yourself, or the other two useless Constructs?	2																					
24	20	21	301									I wanted to argue back, but Camu was right. This team was just too imbalanced.																						
25	21		301								Vera	Anyway, 【kuroname】 seems to be in good spirits. Let's get to the palace before night comes.	1																					
26	22		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Camu	I agree. Let's go, hmph.	2
