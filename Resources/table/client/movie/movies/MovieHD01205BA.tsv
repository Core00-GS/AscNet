4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Lucia	Hunger... It does feel like that.	1																					
5	5		301								Lucia	Constructs don't need to eat. I have long forgotten how hunger feels.	1																					
6	6		301								Lucia	Still, I don't understand why Nanami is doing this.	1																					
7	7		301									Without answering Lucia's question, you just take out an apple from the basket and hand it to her.																						
8	8		302								Try it.	9																						
9	9		301								Lucia	...Okay, I will.	1																					
10	10		401							1	36																							
11	11		301									Lucia carefully lifts the apple with both hands, moving it close to her mouth.																						
12	12		301									She opens her mouth but cannot find a good angle to bite. Her action seems awkward, as if she has forgotten how to eat food.																						
13	13		301									Eventually, she puts the apple between her jaws, then bites into it—																						
14	14		301									"Crunch."																						
15	15		301									The rich aroma of isoamyl acetate spreads into the air along with the crisp sound.																						
16	16		301									Lucia chews the apple in her mouth, then swallows it down.																						
17	17		301									For a second, she is stunned—																						
18	18		301									She then takes a second bite, chews, and swallows—																						
19	19		301									Followed by the third bite, chewing, and swallowing...																						
20	20		301									In the end, Lucia no longer chews the apple. She simply repeats the biting and swallowing actions.

24	24		301								Liv	...	2																					
25	25		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					No one has made a sound. Everyone just quietly watches her eat the apple and listens to the "crunch" sounds.																						
26	26		202							1	2				1																			
27	27		401							1	204																							
28	28		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Only a few brown apple stalks are left on the table.																						
29	29		302								Shall I get you more food?																							
30	30		201							1	500166	6				1																		
31	31		301							1	Lucia	No... thanks...	1																					
32	32		204							1	2																							
33	33		301								Lucia	I haven't felt this full ever since the outbreak of Punishing.	1																					
34	34		301								Lucia	It's a... nostalgic feeling.	1																					
35	35		301									Lucia closes her eyes as if she is enjoying the once-lost sense, but soon opens her eyes again. She looks determined as usual.																						
36	36		301									In this virtual space, Nanami gives the human senses back to Constructs not to weaken them, but to make them enjoy the same happiness as humans.																						
37	37		301									Appetite is one of the most basic needs. Constructs were deprived of this happiness to succumb to the cruel reality.																						
38	38		301									But in Nanami's imagination, such compromise should not be tolerated. That is why she returns this feeling to Constructs, so they can enjoy the same happiness as humans in the following traditional activities.																						
39	39		301									It is called satisfaction.																						
40	40		201							1	1031001	3				1																		
41	41		301							1	Liv	If that was also a hint, Nanami's next trial should have something to do with food, right?	1																					
42	42		302								Correct. When it comes to New Year—	43																						
43	43		302								Nothing matters more than the New Year Eve's dinner!	44																						
44	44		302								But tasting the food itself is not enough.	45																						
45	45		201							1	500166	6				1																		
46	46		301							1	Lucia	There aren't any ingredients in the kitchen. We don't have the currency here to buy food either...	1																					
47	47		401							1	205																							
48	48		301									A "beeeeeep" sound interrupts Lucia. Tiger has already started the arcade and completed a game before anyone can realize.																						
49	49		301									The screen shows "You Win", followed by lots of cheerful sounds.																						
50	50		301									A lot of coins flow out of the machine.																						
51	51		204							1																								
52	52		301								Lucia	What are these...	1																					
53	53		301									Lucia picks up a few coins.																						
54	54		301									The pattern on the front of the coin is difficult to be recognized. It barely resembles the head of a tiger.																						
55	55		301									It says "universal token" on the back.																						
56	56		201							1	500026	10				1																		
57	57		301							1	Lee	She was well prepared.	1																					
58	58		302								Good job, Tiger.	59																						
59	59		201							1	500479					1																		
60	60		301							1	Tiger	Meooooow!	1																					
61	61		301									Hearing your words, Tiger gets even more pumped up. It bashes the screen, trying to make the machine spit out more coins.																						
62	62		301									You quickly grab Tiger before it causes more damage. It finally calms down after some patting.																						
63	63		401							1	204																							
64	64		201							1	500166	1				1																		
65	65		301							1	Lucia	Lee and I will take care of the shopping. Commandant, Liv, please stay put.	1																					
66	66		302								I'll leave it to you then.	67	Be careful.	70																				
67	67		201							1	1031001	1				1

74	74		302								(Hand it over)	75																						
75	75		301								Liv	Thanks.	1

79	79		204							1	2																							
80	80		301								Liv	That's not food, Tiger.	1																					
81	81		202							1	2				1																			
82	82		301									After Lucia and Lee left, Liv proposed to wash the dinnerware and flatware before they came back.																						
83	83		301									There are dishwashers everywhere in Babylonia, but this kitchen is rather "primitive." Only the basic cleaning tools are provided.																						
84	84		301									You and Liv have to use the kitchen sink to manually wash the plates.																						
85	85		301									Liv is doing her part with ease, while your biggest contribution is probably to prevent Tiger from making a mess.																						
86	86		301									"Knock-knock."																						
87	87		301									Someone is knocking at the door.																						
88	88		201							1	1031001	3				1																		
89	89		301							1	Liv	Are they back already?	1																					
90	90		204							1	1																							
91	91		301								Liv	Commandant, could you open the door please?	1																					
92	92		302								Of course.																							
93	93		202						200	1					1																			
94	94		401							2	1516																							
95	95		301									You wipe your hands dry and go to the door. As you open it—																						
96	96		401							1	205																							
97	97		201							1	500225	2				1																		
98	98		301							1	Changyu (?)	Happy New Year's Eve!	1

104	104		301							1	Pulao (?)	Red... Red—	1																					
105	105		301									Thinking back about your experience with door-knocking salesmen, you immediately take the most appropriate action—																						
106	106		401							2	753																							
107	107		302								(Shut the door)	108																						
108	108		202							1	2				1																			
109	109		301									You hear someone rapidly knocking on the door again.																						
110	110		301								Changyu (?)	Don't shut us out! You will block all your fortune away!																						
111	111		301								Sophia (?)	Fortune Kid has messed it up.																						
112	112		301								Fortune Kid	Huh? Is it because of me?																						
113	113		301								Changyu (?)	You were stuttering too much when you said your greeting. That's why they shut the door.																						
114	114		301								Fortune Kid	"Red packet please" isn't a greeting!																						
115	115		301								Fortune Kid	You should have taken out "that" in the beginning.																						
116	116		301								Golden Boy	You didn't remember our duty, Fortune Kid.																						
117	117		301								Jade Girl	We must not fail our duty...																						
118	118		301								Fortune Kid	Our duty is to sell the goods!																						
119	119		301									You open the door again after learning why they are here.																						
120	120		201							1	500225	20				1																		
121	121		301							1	Golden Boy	We should just... Oh hi! Would you like some couplets? We were thinking of offering you a discount.	1																					
122	122		302								What couplets?	123	How much discount?	124																				
123	123	126	301								Golden Boy	Here they are. I promise you'll love these couplets!	1																					
124	124		204							1	6																							
125	125	126	301								Golden Boy	Ahem, let's take a look first.	1																					
126	126		204							1	2																							
127	127		301									He opens a pair of couplets.																						
128	128		301									Top: The Year of Water brings fortune and wonder																						
129	129		301									Bottom: The Year of Tiger roars brilliance and vigor																						
130	130		301									Horizontal: A world of happiness																						
131	131		301								Golden Boy	What do you think? Good omen, isn't it?	1																					
132	132		301								Golden Boy	Now you can get them for this figure only.	1																					
133	133		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					The Golden Boy shows three fingers.
