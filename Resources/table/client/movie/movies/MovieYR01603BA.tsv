5	5		301									Judging by photograph, it appears Luna did take something from the Arctic route Union after all.																						
6	6		301									But it is hard to tell what it is from this angle.																						
7	7		301								Asimov	Could it be...	1																					
8	8		301									But if it really was what he thought it was, why would there be such a thing in the ARU?																						
9	9		301									What are they planning on using it for? And what does Luna intend on doing with it?																						
10	10		301									An ominous thought came to his mind, causing Asimov to subconsciously look at the time.																						
11	11		301								Asimov	It seems unlikely, but it'd best to confirm it, then tell the President. Ugh, forget it.	1

17	17		301								Asimov	The President gave me quite the headache of an assignment. Now he's gone off to sleep. Think you can get me in touch with survivors from the ARU?	1																					
18	18		301								Asimov	I estimate that the Forest Guard and Forsaken are still there. I need to confirm some information with them.	1																					
19	19		301								Celica	Wait... Survivors?	2																					
20	20		301									Celica was stunned for a moment, before coming to her senses.																						
21	21		301								Celica	Understood... Wait a moment.	2

24	24		301									After disconnecting the comm link, Asimov waited for five minutes in a state of perplexity over his work.

28	28		301							1	Celica	Apologies, sir. I tried contacting numerous people, but I couldn't get through to anyone.	2																					
29	29		301								Asimov	...Looks like the radio signal transmitter has also been destroyed.	1																					
30	30		301								Celica	Where should we go from here?	2																					
31	31		301								Asimov	Let Hassen get some rest.	1																					
32	32		301								Asimov	Any teams that have been to the ARU available for dispatch?	1																					
33	33		301								Celica	Unfortunately, there have been too many missions as of late.	2																					
34	34		301									The sound of Celica's rapidly parsing the attendance record is picked up through the comm link.																						
35	35		301								Celica	According to the current mission schedule, the Gray Ravens are the squad that can return to Babylonia the fastest.	2																					
36	36		301								Asimov	Who's the unlucky one...?	1																					
37	37		301								Celica	If the mission is urgent, I can ask the Gray Ravens to abandon their current mission and return pronto.	2																					
38	38		301								Asimov	I still have to confirm something first.	1																					
39	39		301								Asimov	Have the Gray Ravens wait for me in the conference room once they return.	1
