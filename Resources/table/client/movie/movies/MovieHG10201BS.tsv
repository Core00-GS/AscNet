5	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Lee	The only directive we have left in this area is to set up the network routing. You can handle the terminal calibrations, right, Liv?	1																					
6	5		301								Liv	Yes. Leave it to me.	2																					
7	6		301									After the battle, Lee immediately starts setting up various pieces of equipment he brought with him. Liv pitches in as well, sharing the computational load and calibrating each piece as they are put in place.																						
8	101		302								Is there anything I can help with?	7	Where's Lucia?	10																				
9	7	10	301								Lee	There shouldn't be anything else that requires your attention anymore, Commandant. Perhaps you should check on Lucia? She has been off on her own after missions recently.	1																					
10	8	9	301								Liv	Is it because... she doesn't feel as close to us as she used to?	2																					
11	9	10	301								Lee	I don't think that's likely, but you should check it out, Commandant. Just to be safe.	1																					
12	10		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lee	She should be over in that clearing up ahead... It's a good idea to check on her, Commandant.	1

17	12		301								Lucia	No... I should be driving this slash with from left hand...	1																					
18	13		301									You follow Lee's recommendations to find Lucia alone in the staging area. She swings her sword at nothing, the edge whistling through the empty air, but her cuts do not flow from one to the next.																						
19	14		301									After each swing, she retracts her arm and murmurs to herself, as if talking herself through the moves.																						
20	105		302								Lucia!	15	What are you doing?	16																				
21	15	17	301								Lucia	Commandant... Is it time for our next assignment? Sorry, I got a bit carried away.	1																					
22	16	17	301								Lucia	I am studying the forms used by the Lotus and Dawn frames.	1																					
23	17		301								Lucia	Now that you're here, though, could you help with my techniques of sword-fighting?	1																					
24	106		302								You're the expert here.	18	Of course.	19																				
25	18	20	301								Lucia	...I'm not asking for you to teach me how to fight, Commandant. It's about my preferred styles and previous habit.	1																					
26	19	20	301								Lucia	Thank you! I knew you'd say yes... Uh, I mean, prior data shows that Commandant tends to agree to such requests.	1																					
27	107		204							1	1																							
28	20		301								Lucia	As you are well aware, Commandant, I am Lucia... but also not quite Lucia. This often leads to deviations that affect squad cohesion.	1																					
29	21		301								Lucia	That's why I study the data so thoroughly: so I can get back to who I was.	1																					
30	122		302								Then how should I help you?	24	There's no need to force it.	23																				
31	23		301								Lucia	I'm... I don't think I'm forcing anything. I'm just... trying to treasure what I still hold.	1																					
32	24		301								Lucia	Well... Could you please observe my movements, Commandant?	1																					
33	25		301								Lucia	The memories in my M.I.N.D. show that the old Lucia has trained under your supervision before. Hence, you should be familiar with Lucia's attack patterns and postures.	1																					
34	26		301								Lucia	You can guide me to better synchronize my frame reflexes with the previous iteration of my consciousness, and I can adapt to this body much faster and reclaim its lost strength.	1																					
35	27		301								Lucia	So...	1

39	28		301							1	Liv	Sorry, Commandant, could I trouble you to come here for a moment?	1																					
40	29		301									Just as Lucia readies her blade, Lee's voice rings in through the team channel. On the video feed, Liv's face turns forlorn at the sound.																						
41	700		302								What's the matter?	30																						
42	30		301								Liv	Some of the equipment we've just configured requires your biometrics to unlock. Sorry... I should have known.	1

46	31		301							1	Lucia	If that's the case, let's head back together, Commandant.	1																					
47	134		302								You're not going to train?	32	I can go by myself.	33																				
48	32	34	301								Lucia	No. We don't have enough time for a full regimen anyway. The training can wait.	1																					
49	33	34	301								Lucia	While the area has been cleared of hostiles, it is still unwise for you to move unescorted. I shall accompany you.	1																					
50	34		301								Lucia	Commandant? Could we... hold hands, on the way back?	1																					
51	135		302								What for?	35	I don't see why not...	36																				
52	35	37	301								Lucia	This is just part of the memory pairing process. To confirm peripheral data.	1																					
53	36	37	301								Lucia	That's wonderful... even though we can't keep training, we can still verify other memory data while on the move.	1																					
54	37		301									Lucia quickly sheathes her blade and grips your free hand. The moment your hands touch, you distinctly feel a faint tremor in hers.

56	38		301								Lucia	Oh... it... it's... Iâ€”	1																					
57	39		301								Lucia	Lucia puts her other hand on top of the first, cradling your own.	1																					
58	40		301								Lucia	Nngh...?! Mmm...	1																					
59	41		301			PanelActor1Shake						You feel another tremor, bigger this time, travel from her hands to yours. But just as you try to move your hand...																						
60	42		301								Lucia	Sorry, Commandant, please excuse me...!	1

62	43		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Letting go of your hand, Lucia turns and runs in the other direction as fast as she can.
