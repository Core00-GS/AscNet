13	13		301								α	Well. Just a mere hunt.	2																					
14	14		301								Watanabe	A hunt?	1																					
15	15		301								α	Quite. You people were just a few uninvited guests.	2

17	17		301									Sensing Alpha laxing from speech, Watanabe rotates his dagger and redirects her blade to the ground. Stepping on the false edge of her blade, Watanabe hops airborne.

22	22		301			RImgBg1Shake						Watanabe somersaults midair. Using the downward pull of gravity, he launches a wind-tearing cut at Alpha.																						
23	23		301									Alpha, on the ground, leisurely raises her blade behind her head, taking on an inviting stance.																						
24	24		301			RImgBg1Shake						The blades clash. Sparks flash. The two find themselves locked in a bind, but none of them could maneuver their weapons into functional offense. They push off each other to put distance between themselves.																						
25	25		301									A dagger scratch finds itself planted on Alpha's arm. Red vital fluid seep out from the gash.

29	29		301								α	Well... You lot aren't our target this time. Though you did cause some trouble for me... You sure you want more?	2																					
30	30		301								α	Why don't we... make a deal?	2																					
31	31		301									Alpha points her blade at the Forsaken who have fallen to the ground around her.

33	32		301								α	We call it here, and your companions might make it if you patch them up in time.	2																					
34	33		301								Forsaken	Hah... Nice try...!																						
35	34		401							2	10001004																							
36	35		301									One of the Forsaken on the ground fires his gun shakily at Alpha, but before the bullet could reach her, Alpha casually deflects it with her blade.

38	37		301								Watanabe	Clark, take our wounded to the medics.	1

46	44		301							1	α	...He chased after a false truth.	1																					
47	45		301									Under the wary gazes of the Forsaken, Alpha rides on her motorcycle and turns to face Watanabe.
