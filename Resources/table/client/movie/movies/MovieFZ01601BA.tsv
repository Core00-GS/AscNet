23	22		301							1	Hassen	What follows is classified info.	2																					
24	23		301								Hassen	During Operation Acadia, we recovered a massive corpus of data through Gestalt for the operation of Babylonia and the rebuilding of human civilization.	2																					
25	24		301								Hassen	There were some data that were submitted in our logs, but cannot be found inside the database.	2																					
26	25		301								Hassen	And with everything that Babylonia has been through since its conception, tracing where the files have gone has become immensely difficult.	2																					
27	26		301								Hassen	But enough about the past. The top priority right now is to retrieve the lost files.	2																					
28	27		301								Hassen	There are some data blocks that we didn't have the time to go through back then. I've attached their locations to this message. Please have a look.	2																					
29	28		301								Murray	President Hassen, I'm not a direct subordinate of yours right now... Is it really appropriate to give me this kind of mission?	1																					
30	29		301								Hassen	You'd know best.	2																					
31	30		301								Hassen	Working under Nikola has its advantages, which is why you joined him on the surface. No?	2																					
32	31		204							1	1																							
33	32		301								Murray	Just trying to move things in a better direction. It's what everyone would have done.	1																					
34	33		301								Hassen	Which is why I know you'd accept my mission.	2																					
35	34		301								Murray	...What can I say? You see right through me, President Hassen. But the issue remainsâ€”I don't think I should learn of the info within these files.	1																					
36	35		301								Murray	After all, I quite value my life.	1																					
37	36		301								Hassen	I'll tell you the end game... These files are the embers that can end this war.	2																					
38	37		301								Hassen	Everything we've done has been to end the war, and these files can forward this objective immensely.	2																					
39	38		301								Hassen	I don't think I have to remind you of the confidentiality level of these files.	2																					
40	39		204							1																								
41	40		301								Murray	Pardon me, but why not directly extract the files yourself? But rather, have me retrieve them first, then relay them to you?	1																					
42	41		301								Hassen	There are quite a few reasons, but none that should concern you.	2																					
43	42		301								Murray	...President Hassen, you are just like Commander Nikola sometimes.	1																					
44	43		301								Hassen	I get that a lot.	2																					
45	44		301								Hassen	Enough with the chit-chat. Time's ticking.	2																					
46	45		301								Hassen	Once I express interest in these files, Nikola will certainly react immediately.	2																					
47	46		301								Hassen	If you think I'm like him, then you must also know what makes us different. Especially on our views about certain things.	2																					
48	47		301								Hassen	For this tiny sliver of hope, are you willing to take the risk?	2																					
49	48		301								Murray	...Well, I don't think I have a choice.	1																					
50	49		301								Hassen	In that case, good luck.	2

56	55		301								Murray	Hah. Our good President just handed down the thorniest mission like it's nothing.	1																					
57	56		301								Murray	...But, this is an opportunity for me as well.	1
