5	5		302								Good to see you.	6																						
6	6		301							1	Staessen	It sure was no easy feat to suppress Amberia. You've been of great help to the ARU.	1

16	16		301							1	Diana	...No, it's something else. There was a blizzard this morning that blew down a third of the Forest Guard tents.	1																					
17	17		301								Diana	We need to go back and fix them.	1

22	22		302								What's the matter?	23																						
23	23		301							1	Staessen	Well, I actually wanted to announce a decision during the banquet.	1																					
24	24		301								Staessen	However, if the greatest beneficiaries from this announcement aren't present, it'll be easily overturned.	1																					
25	25		301								Staessen	My proposal to fight for their rights will be denied, and my own reputation will be tarnished.	1

31	31		301							1	Staessen	Yeah...	1																					
32	32		301								Staessen	In the name of the captain, I will... absolve the Forest Guards from their status of "sinners."	1																					
33	33		301								Everyone	!																						
34	34		301							1	Staessen	Shh! You should know that many people will publicly oppose my proposal, despite how helpful the Forest Guards have been.	1																					
35	35		301								Staessen	...The opposition will have all sorts of reasons. Which is why I wanted them to be here to make it easier.	1																					
36	36		301								Staessen	No matter what happened before, this time... they need to speak for themselves.	1
