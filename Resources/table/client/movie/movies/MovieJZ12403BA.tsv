25	25		301									The bird shakes off crimson Punishing Virus from its wings, revealing the white plumes under... It has become an egret.																						
26	26		301								Liv	Why...?																						
27	27		301									Liv is slightly confused. She can only vaguely grasp the information as her memory is trapped among the vast amount of data.																						
28	28		301								Liv	Where do you come from...? Why do you keep changing your look?																						
29	29		301									It didn't answer. Elegantly paced, the bird just walks around and sings. As it flaps its wings again, white feathers fall on Liv, throwing her into another data torrent.

50	50		301								??	Officer Yelena...?																						
51	51		301									I heard the medic's voice behind me, but did not look back. Instead, I continue to gaze at the gunfire in the war zone.

60	60		301							1	Yelena	Have all the wounded soldiers been treated?	1																					
61	61		301								Medic	Yeah, all done. The other two medics are recovering well. If time permits, they will all be fit for combat. We are running low on medical supplies though... When can we expect them?	2																					
62	62		301								Yelena	Never.	1																					
63	63		301								Medic	...What?	2																					
64	64		301								Yelena	The HQ wants us to give up this base and retreat before sunrise.	1																					
65	65		301									The medic's eyes open wide, unable to believe what she just heard. I see gunfire from afar reflected in her clear pupils.																						
66	66		204							2	5																							
67	67		301								Medic	But there are still lots of soldiers outside the secure area of defense! Are we going to leave them all behind?!	2

69	69		202							1	2				1																			
70	70		301									These soldiers have given it all... Her kindness is invaluable to them.																						
71	71		301									All soldiers have developed trust in her. Some would even scream her name on the brink of death. She has made quite a name for herself with her fearlessness, along with her signature smile—my reprimand didn't work. She has already mastered the skill to treat the soldiers while comforting them, which is not a bad thing.																						
72	72		301									These soldiers have given it all... Her kindness is invaluable to them.

76	76		301								Medic	Why the rush...? Can't we wait for the other soldiers to retreat first? We tried so hard to save them...	2																					
77	77		301								Yelena	The HQ always makes the most rational decision. We need to stop before it's too late.	1																					
78	78		301								Medic	But I have been working so hard these days... I...	2																					
79	79		202							1	2				1																			
80	80		301									Her voice begins to tremble with sobs, but she soon realizes it is inappropriate to talk like this. She wipes her eyes and tries to calm herself.

84	84		301									There is a dead silence. Moments later, she whispers to herself.																						
85	85		301								Medic	What's the point of this war...? Did I really save those lives...?	2																					
86	86		301								Yelena	It's too early to doubt it. You will have more questions like this in the future, only more painful.	1																					
87	87		301								Yelena	I used to ask myself over and over again. What's the point of this war? Will humanity win? Can the Punishing Virus truly be defeated?	1																					
88	88		301								Yelena	Nobody has the answer. Maybe mankind only has a one-in-a-billion chance to win, but that's what we are fighting for.	1																					
89	89		301								Yelena	It's like... um... The chance for humans to emerge on Earth was extremely slim to begin with, right?	1																					
90	91		301								Yelena	But since we are already here as a result of that miracle, why don't we believe that mankind will also grasp that similarly slim chance to defeat the Punishing Virus?	1																					
91	92		204							2	16																							
92	93		301									With tears still on her face, the medic smiles.																						
93	94		301								Medic	Yes... You're right.	2																					
94	95		301								Medic	I will continue to fight, even for a one-in-a-billion chance.	2																					
95	96		301								Medic	Yarha once said... we are just an advanced breed of primates on a minor planet orbiting around a very average star, in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies.	2																					
96	97		301								Yelena	What? Who?	1																					
97	98		204							2																								
98	99		301								Medic	The soldier asking for help on the first day we arrived at the frontline... Remember?	2																					
99	100		301								Yelena	Oh, Gloomy Face. Do you chat with them during their treatment?	1																					
100	101		301								Medic	We don't have enough supplies. Sometimes, we couldn't give them general anesthesia during surgery. Talking to them can distract them from the pain...	2																					
101	102		301								Medic	Flina loves desserts, so I often ask her to think of her favorite ones. It works well. Hayami has a little brother who she misses badly. She can endure any pain if we talk about her family. I hope she can go home one day. Yarha seems to be really into science. He always talks about it when he's nervous...	2																					
102	103		301									The medic talks about every patient of hers like they are her best friends. She will make a great doctor.																						
103	104		204							2	19																							
104	105		301								Medic	He seems to be always pessimistic... He once told me that perhaps the fate of humanity was to embrace doomsday and be destroyed.	2																					
105	106		301								Medic	I couldn't answer him back then, for I was also lost... But your words made me start thinking of my duty, Officer Yelena.	2																					
106	107		301								Medic	No matter how I ended up here, as long as I can do my little part and help others...	2																					
107	108		301								Medic	I'll be very happy already.	2																					
108	109		204							1	7																							
109	110		301								Yelena	You always give me surprises, medic.	1

112	113		204							1																								
113	114		301								Yelena	Your greatest strength is the ability to spread hope in a world of despair.	1																					
114	115		202							1	2				1																			
115	116		301									She flushes once again at my frankness. Somehow, I feel like her red face isn't that frail anymore.

117	118		201							2	500402	5	450																					
118	119		301							1	Medic	Someone once saved my life. I will be ashamed if I waste it away...	2																					
119	120		301								Medic	And it was your guidance that helped me find the meaning of my life. If I can pass on this faith, my life and that person's life will also be continued on this land.	2																					
120	121		301								Medic	Allow me to express my gratitude once again... Thank you, Ma'am.	2

130	131		301							1	Yelena	Speaking of it, I know a way to quickly make your wish come true.	1																					
131	132		301								Medic	Hmm? What is it?	2																					
132	133		301									I raise my steel arm and half-jokingly say.																						
133	134		301								Yelena	You can swap into this.	1																					
134	135		301								Medic	C-can I?	2																					
135	136		301								Yelena	...Of course not. Back in my hometown, I could fight a bear barehanded.	1																					
136	137		301								Medic	...I'm sorry.	2																					
137	138		301								Yelena	Actually, I don't know. The World Government should have made a lot of Constructs now, but apparently they can't be used yet. I'm just an experiment.	1																					
138	139		202							1	2				1																			
139	140		301									I twist my right arm. It makes a horrifying clink and turns over. The medic turns pale and I feel like she is going to rush over to fix my arm, so I quickly twist it back to the correct position.																						
140	141		301									She wants to touch my arm, but takes her hand back after seeing the scratch marks on it.

142	143		201							2	500402		450																					
143	144		301							1	Medic	...Does it hurt?	2																					
144	145		301								Yelena	The pain module can be turned off, but I hate it because... Um... I don't feel like a human anymore. It's like I'm just a running machine.	1																					
145	146		301								Medic	How did they... modify you?	2																					
146	147		301									I try to recall but cannot find any good memory, so I give an obscure answer.																						
147	148		301								Yelena	The pain is worse than local anesthesia. In fact, they could not use anesthesia at all in the surgery. It would make... M.I.N.D. unstable.	1																					
148	149		301								Yelena	There's nothing good about it. I only did it because there was no other way...	1																					
149	150		301								Yelena	The best vessel of human soul is still the human body. It's nature's selection. Extracting the soul and putting it elsewhere will inevitably change its shape.	1																					
150	151		301								Yelena	It takes a lot more effort to barely maintain the soul's original form.	1																					
151	152		301								Medic	Is that so...? I'm sorry, Ma'am... It must be difficult.	2																					
152	153		301								Yelena	But compared to the human body, the power it brings matters a lot more in a war. We don't have much choice in this age.	1																					
153	154		301								Medic	...Thank you.	2																					
154	155		301								Medic	No matter what... I will not fail you.	2																					
155	156		301								Yelena	...It's getting late. Time to go back. We need to evacuate before dawn. There's not much time left.	1

164	165		301								Yelena	Have you searched everywhere?	1																					
165	166		301									I try to hold my rage. Cowards, deserters, and dropping the ball at crucial times are all among the things I hate the most.																						
166	167		301								Soldiers	We did, Ma'am! We searched within the area of defense, but couldn't find him anywhere...	2
