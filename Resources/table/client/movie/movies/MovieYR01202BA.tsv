5	5		301			DialogEnable				1	Nikola	The extra thing I asked you to prepare, how is it coming along, Asimov?	2																					
6	6		301								Asimov	Had a few hiccups. Still working on it.	1																					
7	7		301								Asimov	As you know, the Task Force classifies combat zones based on their Punishing Virus intensity.	1																					
8	8		301								Asimov	Most people are familiar with the three major categories of combat zones: high, middle, and low. But there's a fourth: Dead Zones.	1																					
9	9		301								Asimov	A lot can be said about Dead Zones, but to sum it up in one sentence: we can't go in there unprotected—not even after we get a serum injection.	1																					
10	10		301								Asimov	So, in order to protect the M.I.N.D. stability of Constructs in Dead Zones, we've upgraded the link chamber.	1																					
11	11		301								Asimov	I will spare you the details about the link chamber. All you need to know, which you already do, is that it's a machine that allows Commandant to command Constructs remotely.	1																					
12	12		301								Nikola	I heard you've tried remote command on several teams now.	2																					
13	13		301								Asimov	Only a handful... And we expect that only Cerberus will adopt the technique in the end.	1																					
14	14		301								Asimov	Ever since remote connection was abolished, it has been excluded by military schools from Commandant assessment criteria. As a result, the available sample are few and far between.	1																					
15	15		301								Asimov	Most of the registered Commandants have no access to the link chamber. Even if they do—	1																					
16	16		301								Asimov	The Constructs still have their limitations. They can only get to the outermost part of a Dead Zone. If they try going any deeper, malfunctions occur immediately...	1																					
17	17		301								Nikola	So do you mean to tell me that the program has failed, Asimov?	2																					
18	18		301								Asimov	"Fail" is a word I never said and never will say.	1																					
19	19		301								Asimov	Me and my technicians are ready to move on to phase two. We have plenty of time to pick a Commandant, but right now we need to have the Constructs overhauled.	1																					
20	20		301								Nikola	Overhaul? The way you did with Gray Raven's Constructs?	2																					
21	21		301								Asimov	Only more radical... I'm going to develop new models that are truly fit for purpose.	1																					
22	22		301								Nikola	And how do you plan to do it?	2

24	24		301									Asimov lowers his voice. Only the word "Corrupted" is faintly heard from his mouth.

28	28		301								Nikola	Are you serious?	2																					
29	29		301								Asimov	If you approve it, yes.	1
