3	3		301			DialogEnable						The disc-shaped elevator descends slowly, finally bringing the you all to a larger disc.																						
4	4		301									After the four of you jump onto the disc, the elevator descends straight down to the desert below.																						
5	5		301									—But is it really a desert?																						
6	6		301									At such a height, none of you are able to discern its surface—whether it is covered with fine sand or coarse gravel.																						
7	7		301									But if you could magnify the image with an optical device, you would find that the dunes are made of crumbled buildings and debris.																						
8	8		301									Moreover, the constant collision and friction between the concrete blocks have broken them down into smaller fragments.																						
9	9		301									Once the fragments are fine enough, they seem to disappear altogether—as if sinking to the depths below.																						
10	10		301									There are also several towering buildings among the "sand," seemingly having survived the collapse without being completely broken down.																						
11	11		301									That being said, the constant erosion continues to take its toll on the buildings. With enough time, they, too, will disintegrate into "sand."																						
12	12		301									Regardless, Embla—or what appears to be Embla—kneels before a massive figure on the giant disc.																						
13	13		301								???	You are the one who wants to awaken "Father"?

15	15		301							1	Embla?	I am.	1																					
16	16		301								???	...Your speech pattern has deviated from your defaults.																						
17	17		301								Embla?	...I. Have been in contact. With outside beings.	1																					
18	18		301								???	Outside beings... I see.																						
19	19		301								???	You are a "defect."																						
20	20		301								Embla?	...I'm a. "Defect"?	1																					
21	21		301								???	You are not a champion of the "war," nor are you the defeated.																						
22	22		401							1	203																							
23	23		301								???	You will be destroyed to uphold the rules of purity for the "war."																						
24	24		301								Embla?	I. Will be... Destroyed?	1

26	26		301									The massive figure speaks as it raises the polearm in its hand—																						
27	27		302								Lucia!	28

29	29		301							1	Lucia	Got it!	1

31	31		301									Although slightly hesitant about your orders, Lucia immediately rushes forward—

34	34		301									—And she smashes the weapon out of the figure's hand, sending it flying off to the side.																						
35	35		301									As Lucia attacks, Liv and Lee work together to drag the kneeling Embla off to the side.																						
36	36		301								???	What are you?																						
37	37		302								Stop taking the words out of my mouth.	38																						
38	38		301								???	"Father" bequeathed me the name "Machiavelli".																						
39	39		301								Machiavelli	"Father" bestowed me with power as the "Final Arbiter".																						
40	40		301								Machiavelli	—I stand guard here for generations awaiting the "war" to produce a champion.																						
41	41		301								Machiavelli	—With my own hands, I will awaken the half of "Father" most suitable for this land.																						
42	42		301								Machiavelli	Therefore, all "defects" are not permitted to enter "the Strip of Truth". Only the champion... may enter.																						
43	43		302								Sorry, that is not for you to decide.	44	Embla isn't a defect.	45																				
44	44	46	301								Machiavelli	You have no right to decide, even if there is a Sapien among you.																						
45	45		301								Machiavelli	Judgment of said "defects" is not determined by uncertified "Sapiens" such as yourself.																						
46	46		201							1	500029																							
47	47		301							1	Lucia	Looks like it's refusing to talk this out.	1																					
48	48		202							1					1																			
49	49		301								Machiavelli	I do not need to talk with the likes of you.																						
50	50		301								Machiavelli	"War" must continue. Your flesh and blood will be used to build a new "battlefield."																						
51	51		302								Is this city the "battlefield"?	52																						
52	52		301								Machiavelli	Indeed. Then a new "war" will begin anew.																						
53	53		302								What about the "defects"?	54																						
54	54		301								Machiavelli	Beings that do not participate in the "war" do not have the right to live.																						
55	55		201							1	1011001	10																						
56	56		301							1	Lee	Well, I guess there's no point in wasting our breath.	1																					
57	57		201							1	500029																							
58	58		301							1	Lucia	If we don't stop it here, Embla will be destroyed and become a part of the city...	1																					
59	59		301								Machiavelli	Indeed. The rules of Father warrant no exception.																						
60	60		301								Lucia	Commandant, we'll count on your commands.	1																					
61	61		302								Understood.	62																						
62	62		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Defeating Machiavelli is the only way Embla... and we will survive.	1
