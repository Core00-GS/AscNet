3	3		301			DialogEnable						The journey over to the laundry room goes smoother than you expected.																						
4	4		301									Avoiding the patrolling mechanoids and passing through the dusty old cells and interrogation rooms, you find most mechanoids ignore you as they carry on with their preset routes, doomed to repeat for eternity until they eventually join the corpses littered on the floor.																						
5	5		301									Twenty minutes later, you find yourself inside the laundry room.																						
6	6		301									The laundry room is big, with four rows of washing machines on each side. There are carts scattered about with faded fabric decorating the floor. You edge toward the door on the other side of the room while keeping an eye on your blind spots.																						
7	7		301									If your speculations are correct, then the person who responded to your distress signal should be behind that door.																						
8	8		301									You try the door handle but it does not budge. None of the keys you got from the guard unlock it.																						
9	9		301									Just as you contemplate using force, you hear a rhythmic tapping from a pipe in the corner.																						
10	10		301									This time there is no melody to it. It only serves to nudge you in the right direction, to "pay attention to here."																						
11	11		301									Heading toward the sound, you follow the vibrating pipe to a washing machine in the corner, and you can hear the taps coming from the wall behind.																						
12	12		301									Carefully pushing away the washer, you find a small hole at the bottom of the wall that seems to connect to the other room.																						
13	13		301									Just as you are about to bend down and inspect, a small black cube rolls out of the hole and stops by your feet.																						
14	14		302								(Pick it up)	15	(Be alert)	16																				
15	15	17	301									Without much thought, you bend to pick up the cube.																						
16	16		301									You instinctively retreat, only picking up the cube after confirming that it is not an explosive.																						
17	17		301									It looks like a PDA used by the office workers of the prison, almost identical to the device you found in the warden's office.																						
18	18		301									But this one seems to be operating just fine. The screen wakes up as you wipe away the dust with your fingers.																						
19	19		301									The monitor displays an online diary of a guard, but most of the content has been turned into random codes due to data damage.																						
20	20		301									What catches your attention is the topmost message.																						
21	21		301								Device Monitor	"Hello, stranger."																						
22	22		301									"Apologies that I can only communicate with you like this."																						
23	23		302								This is...!	24																						
24	24		301									After a few seconds of silence, the message refreshes again.																						
25	25		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Device Monitor	"I believe you are stuck here like me. I'm sorry to spring this on you, but I need your help."																						
26	26		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory36.jpg																								
27	27		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						And thus, things are unfolding in a way out of Roland's expectations once again.																						
28	28		301									That person really did traverse through half the prison to where he is.																						
29	29		201							1	500334	2																						
30	30		301							1	Roland	...Ha, to be wrong twice in a row, what a peculiar experience.	1																					
31	31		301									The unfamiliar and tingly feeling dissipates not long after. Roland forces himself to focus on the message he just sent on the device.																						
32	32		301								Roland	Hm... Was this a tad too dramatic as an opening line?	1																					
33	33		301								Roland	But it does look like an interesting start to a story.	1																					
34	34		301								Roland	Oh Roland, looks like you still have what it takes to do improv.	1																					
35	35		301									Roland's lips pull into a wry smile. Sitting in the corner against the wall, he props his chin on one hand while he stares at the device in his other.																						
36	36		301									This was an unexpected find while he was wandering around the prison. The specially designed device can send and receive messages just like the fixed comms equipment in the prison.																						
37	37		301									While he had waited, he spent his time repairing it. Although tthe audio module was completely destroyed, the other functions are still operational.																						
38	38		301								Roland	Will you play along with me?	1																					
39	39		301									After a while, the message refreshes.																						
40	40		302								Don't worry, I'll get you out.	41	I'm glad I'm not alone here.	42																				
41	41	43	301								Roland	Oh, hook, line, and sinker. What a kind person.	1																					
42	42		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	...	1

44	44		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory29.jpg																								
45	45		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After understanding the usage of the device, you replied to the other person in the form of a new dairy post.																						
46	46		301									Confirming that the laundry room is not under the threat of the Corrupted, you sit down by the wall.																						
47	47		301									Only a wall separates you and the person who is in the same situation, but the two of you are only able to communicate through the small device in your hands.																						
48	48		301									They explained their situation. They were looking for supplies when the doors suddenly closed and thus trapped them here.																						
49	49		301									It seems that they also do not know why the emergency mode was activated, so you place your focus on how to escape.																						
50	50		301									First, you think about breaking down a wall or door with force, but you immediately realize why that would not be possible.																						
51	51		301									The weapons you currently carry are not strong enough to destroy a prison door or wall, and you can guess that applies to the other person as well.																						
52	52		301									Looks like you'll have to come up with another plan if you want to converge with the other person.																						
53	53		301									You recall the memory of the map you found in the office, and realize something.																						
54	54		301									The main control room that controls all exits is not far from where you currently are, while the warden's office is situated in the middle of Zone B.																						
55	55		301									If you can find hints regarding control commands in the warden's office, then there is a chance that you can crack the command in the main control room and open the main gates of the prison.																						
56	56		302								I have an idea.	57	I have a plan.	57																				
57	57		302								We need to cooperate.																							
58	58		301								Device Monitor	"Understood. What do you require of me?"																						
59	59		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					And so you tell the other person your plan.																						
60	60		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory36.jpg																								
61	61		201							1	500334	2																						
62	62		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Roland	I see...	1																					
63	63		301								Roland	Working together, huh? All right, it has been a while. And it is more interesting than breaking out by force.	1																					
64	64		301									Getting to the warden's office is like a stroll in the park for Roland, but... for a weak and trapped person, getting past all the Corrupted on the way is impossible.																						
65	65		301								Roland	Right, for authenticity, I need to increase the difficulty.	1																					
66	66		301								Roland	Hm... "But there are lots of Corrupted blocking the way to the warden's office, I can't take care of them all on my own."	1																					
67	67		301								Roland	That sounds about right.	1																					
68	68		301									After a while, he receives a reply.																						
69	69		301								Device Monitor	"Okay. I'll distract them, wait for my signal."																						
70	70		301								Roland	...Distract them?	1																					
71	71		301									How? How can one distract Corrupted that they couldn't even reach?																						
72	72		301								Roland	All right then, let's see what you've got.	1																					
73	73		301								Roland	I'll wait for your good news in the warden's office, my dear stranger.	1																					
74	74		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Roland stands and heads toward the warden's office.																						
75	75		202							1					1																			
76	76		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory84.jpg																								
77	77		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						He whisks through the dim corridors as if he is taking a stroll and window shopping.																						
78	78		301									Suddenly, a piercing static noise interrupts the peace from afar.																						
79	79		301									The volume of the static quickly lowers, replaced by piano music. Due to the lack of maintenance of the prison's audio systems, the song is mixed with static noise, turning the originally soothing piano music into something from a horror movie.																						
80	80		201							1	500334																							
81	81		301							1	Roland	?	1																					
82	82		301									The piano music barely lasted a second before it got turned into elegant cello music. It looks like someone is accessing the prison's audio system.																						
83	83		202							1					1																			
84	84		301									Has that person already reached the control room?																						
85	85		301									All over the prison, rackets of mechanoids crashing and noises of damaged audio modules can be heard. The Corrupted realize where the sound is coming from and start to make their way over from different directions.																						
86	86		301									So this is what they meant when they said they'll "distract them."																						
87	87		201							1	500334	1																						
88	88		301							1	Roland	Not bad.	1																					
89	89		301									The music changes again, this time from the elegant cello music to death metal.																						
90	90		301									The wild voice of death reverberates within the prison walls, sounding even more spine-chilling than the wailing of the Corrupted.																						
91	91		301								Roland	...?	1																					
92	92		202							1					1																			
93	93		301									The Corrupted rush over, gathering under the speaker.																						
94	94		301									The death metal stops and a pop song starts to play, followed by jazz, rap, and even the prison's 15th set of radio calisthenics.																						
95	95		301									...What are you, a DJ?																						
96	96		301									Not long after, the music changes again.																						
97	97		301									Flamenco music plays from the prison speakers, startling Roland a bit.																						
98	98		301									That is the same song that is used in the prison-themed movie. The protagonist deliberately starts a group fight to avert the attention of the guards, while the other character go and steal a metal piece for lockpicking when the guards are busy stopping the fight.																						
99	99		301									The director brilliantly chose to use flamenco as the background music to create a humorous yet exciting scene.																						
100	100		301									The message on the device finally refreshes.																						
101	101		301								Device Monitor	"Sorry for the wait. That was my signal."																						
102	102		301								Device Monitor	"You can head toward the warden's office now."																						
103	103		201							1	500334	1																						
104	104		301							1	Roland	Pft... Ha... Hahahaha!	1																					
105	105		301								Roland	This human is more interesting than I thought.	1																					
106	106		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	Looks like I won't be bored for the time being.	1																					
107	107		202							1					1																			
108	108		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory40.jpg																								
109	109		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						With the path all cleared, Roland soon arrives at the warden's office.																						
110	110		301									It doesn't take him long to find the command and passcode. Old safes are easy to break, and no secret can hide from Roland.																						
111	111		301									What intrigues him more at the moment is his "partner."																						
112	112		301									Roland sends over the command and passcode through the device, and receives a swift reply.																						
113	113		301								Device Monitor	"The door is open. Nice working with you."																						
114	114		301								Device Monitor	"There are still Corrupted outside so we can meet in the cafeteria area first before breaking out together. I've already planned our routes."																						
115	115		301									The following message simply explains their intended way of escape and route. It also details possible situations and their solutions.																						
116	116		201							1	500334	1																						
117	117		301							1	Roland	...Tsk, I thought our cooperation would end here, not develop into a meeting.	1																					
118	118		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	Well, this sure is a first, someone who goes looking for trouble.	1																					
119	119		202							1					1																			
120	120		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory29.jpg																								
121	121		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The stunt you pulled just now would've earned you a bit fat zero from an angry instructor if you were in an F.O.S. tactical simulation class. After all, no one would use popular music as a signal on the battlefield.																						
122	122		302								Well, it doesn't hurt to have a bit of fun once in a while.	123	I'm just making the best of this situation.	124																				
123	123		301									While adding in a little "extra something" for the other person.																						
124	124		301									You had looked at the map in the control room to decide the best place for carrying out the distraction, and then made the loudest noise you could with the speakers, leading away the Corrupted on the route toward the warden's office.																						
125	125		301									The other person found the warden's office fairly quickly. You thought it might take some time for them to find the command and passcode, but it is sent to you soon after.																						
126	126		301									You immediately key in the code on the control panel to unlock the gates. The indicator lamp on the monitor labeled "Control Area Door" turns green.																						
127	127		301									The outermost lock is removed. You can finally leave.																						
128	128		301									You shake your legs as you take in a deep breath, and notify the other person that the gates are open. But that doesn't mean you're safe yet. The Corrupted who are lurking around are still a threat.																						
129	129		301									Which is why you suggested to the other person to meet up first.																						
130	130		301								Device Monitor	"Why would you go through all the trouble?"																						
131	131		302								Because it's still dangerous outside.	132	It'll increase our chances of survival.	132																				
132	132		301								Device Monitor	"I might hinder you though."																						
133	133		302								You won't.	134																						
134	134		302								Because we work well together.	135																						
135	135		302								If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have been able to unlock the gates this quickly.	136																						
136	136		301								Device Monitor	"The gates are open, I've lost all my value, you could've just abandoned me here and left."																						
137	137		301								Device Monitor	"Why would you still want to take the long way and converge with me first?"																						
138	138		302								Because you asked for my help.	139																						
139	139		302								And...	140																						
140	140		302								Technically, you're the one who responded to my distress signal first.	141																						
141	141		301								Device Monitor	"..."																						
142	142		301									There is a pause in the refreshing of messages.																						
143	143		301								Device Monitor	"Even though I only sent over a melody from an unpopular movie?"																						
144	144		302								But I still understood.	145	It was a bit hard to notice, maybe we should try something more popular next time.	146																				
145	145	147	301								Device Monitor	"...I doubt anyone else would've understood."																						
146	146		301								Device Monitor	"Maybe it's best that there's no next time."																						
147	147		301									Even though you cannot see the expression of the person on the other end of these messages, you can feel their wryness from their words.																						
148	148		302								I'm actually curious as to why you chose to send that.	149																						
149	149		301								Device Monitor	"Because the only Morse code I know is 'SOS'."																						
150	150		302								Really? I don't believe that.	151	Even though you were able to decipher the command and passcode?	153																				
151	151		301								Device Monitor	"^-^"																						
152	152	154	301									An emoticon shows up on the screen.																						
153	153		301								Device Monitor	"That's because the passcode was just stuck to the underside of the table."																						
154	154		301									You couldn't stifle the smile on your face.																						
155	155		301								Device Monitor	"Maybe we can have a chat."																						
156	156		301								Device Monitor	"About the movie, among other things."																						
157	157		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				Of course.	158	After we get out of this place.	158

161	161		301									Roland reads the replies on device, his face void of emotion.																						
162	162		301									Even though he's just playing a character in the chat, he still feels a tinge of real emotion there.																						
163	163		301									Bitterness, joy, and slight anticipation, they slowly flood out of his heart like bubbles, only for him to crush them with his bare hands.																						
164	164		301									An actor does not show their own emotions.																						
165	165		301									To seek truth in an illusion will only come back and stab him in the back one day.
