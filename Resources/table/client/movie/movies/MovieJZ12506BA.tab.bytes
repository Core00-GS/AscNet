25	25		301								Ayla	Hmm... Ah, I'm sorry.	1																					
26	26		301									The young artist blinks, closing her eyes before opening them again.																						
27	27		301									In the expansive opera hall, one gentleman sits alone, listening to her going through the script in her hand.																						
28	28		301								Allen	That's alright. You finished the whole thing. I'm still appreciating the aftertaste.	2																					
29	29		301									The gentleman shrugs, defusing the awkward situation.																						
30	30		301								Allen	I'm just curious why you kept staring at those letters on the side every time you were done with a scene.	2																					
31	31		301								Allen	Letters. Not very common nowadays, aren't they? Are they your source of inspiration?	2																					
32	32		301								Ayla	Not that they aren't... but perhaps I should say... they are what the play is based on?	1																					
33	33		301								Allen	Oh... an autobiography? I should keep my curiosity in check, then.	2																					
34	34		301									The man knocks on the floor with his cane, his smile slightly shifting.																						
35	35		204							2																								
36	36		301								Allen	Anyway, I suppose you're looking forward to what I have to say about your play.	2																					
37	37		301								Allen	Well, bravo! Remarkable work for someone new to the art form.	2																					
38	38		301								Allen	A young opera composer meets a group of art-loving kindred spirits on her way to search for a girl, ending up saved by her past self.	2																					
39	39		301								Allen	Journeys of self-discovery aren't uncommon in operas, but it is refreshing to see yours presented this way.	2																					
40	40		301								Allen	Only you can come up with ideas like that, Ayla.	2																					
41	41		301								Allen	Sure, your writing on the children might be a little too assuming, but that's nothing new for young writers.	2																					
42	42		301								Allen	Probably just your first instinct when you were writing, and you didn't realize it. Mark it down, and make sure you don't make the same mistake twice when you go through your draft again.	2																					
43	43		301								Ayla	Thanks, Chairman. But you must know that I'm not looking for simple comments like that.	2																					
44	44		301								Allen	Changes on the script, huh? Don't worry. I more or less got that when you were reading your script.	2																					
45	45		204							2																								
46	46		301								Allen	But... before I say anything, I must ask you if that's all you want, Ayla? You asked me to listen to your new play just to get my suggestions on changes to make?	2																					
47	47		204							1	1																							
48	48		301								Ayla	...Of course not. I... have something else I want to tell you.	1																					
49	49		301									Ayla lowers her head, her gaze turning to someone at the side.																						
50	50		301									That person is lying in her chamber, her hands crossing and resting above her abdomen. Her eyes are lightly shut, the corners of her lips slightly raised, her long hair draping by her sides.																						
51	51		301								Ayla	...	1																					
52	52		301									Ayla tries to call her by her name.																						
53	53		301									But she knows that person is not here now.																						
54	54		301								Allen	No matter how many times I've seen it, the Capriccio frame still impresses me with its intricacy. It's only here thanks to your push and design.	2																					
55	55		301								Allen	Did you bring it here because you have a new idea for a coating?	2																					
56	56		301								Ayla	Haha. Nothing that complicated, Chairman.	1																					
57	57		301								Ayla	She's here... just because... because...	1																					
58	58		204							1	8																							
59	59		301									Ayla looks nonchalant, but her voice is slightly shaking, and her words are stuck in her throat.																						
60	60		301									‚ÄîI just wanted her to be able to see this.																						
61	61		204							2	1																							
62	62		301								Allen	...Alright, relax. Let's change the subject.	2																					
63	63		301									Chuckling, Allen makes a few spins with his cane before standing up from his seat and walking toward the stage.																						
64	64		301								Allen	People in the saloon have been talking about you. They said you kept working late in your studio without sleeping, and they don't really see you that often anymore.	2																					
65	65		301								Allen	They said it wasn't like you, but I think you've just been focusing all your infectious passion on one thing.	2																					
66	66		204							2																								
67	67		301								Allen	That thing being this "Song of Flowers" you just read, isn't it?	2																					
68	68		204							1	4																							
69	69		301								Ayla	...It is.	1																					
70	70		301									Ayla turns toward the frame by her side again, Ayla's face reflected on the glass of the chamber.																						
71	71		301									It is a face of affection and regret.																						
72	72		301								Ayla	...Have you heard of whale songs?	1																					
73	73		301								Allen	You got me there. I once took a probe and stayed by the shore for a few weeks. I was almost frozen to death, but I heard nothing.	2																					
74	74		204							1	1																							
75	75		301								Ayla	Whoa, another wild thing you've done for art there, Chairman.	1																					
76	76		204							1

80	80		301									Ayla takes out a remote and opens her portable studio terminal.																						
81	81		401							1	51																							
82	82		301									It plays a slow and soft aria.																						
83	83		301									Allen, with all he has seen and done, is still slightly taken aback when he first hears it.																						
84	84		301									The tone ebbs and flows as it rises higher. Suddenly, a vast ocean seems to appear before his very eyes.																						
85	85		301									The female singer is not fully imitating the sound of a real whale, but she conveys the same expression in the melody.																						
86	86		301									‚ÄîA lonely blue whale is swinging its tail fin and cruising in the sea. Again and again it sings, its song echoing throughout the ocean depths, but there is no response.																						
87	87		301									The singing stopped. The song has no end, and the lonely blue whale did not find its kind.																						
88	88		301									Taking a few moments, Allen remembers where he has heard this aria before.

90	90		201							2	500111		-400																					
91	91		301							1	Allen	"Practice No. 654"... her unfinished aria.	2																					
92	92		301								Ayla	That's right. The one I have is incomplete.	1																					
93	93		301								Ayla	She said that she hadn't thought of an ending yet because she hasn't seen the ocean with her own eyes.	1																					
94	94		301								Ayla	She'd write the second half after she'd seen the real ocean.	1																					
95	95		301								Ayla	...Just like this.	1

97	97		201							1	500110																							
98	98		301							1		Ayla clears her throat and holds up her arms, suddenly singing with a gentle voice.																						
99	99		301									The tone also rises, but the direction the whale is heading has changed.																						
100	100		301									Ayla is not a skilled singer, but even her simple delivery has revealed to Allen the meaning behind the melody.																						
101	101		301									‚ÄîThe lonely blue whale is heading deeper into the ocean. It is still singing, and its voice would have formed a cage around it as it echoes more frequently in the narrow trench.																						
102	102		301									But the cage never forms. Instead, the further it dives into the trench, the more faded its voice is, its echo nowhere to be found.																						
103	103		301									Almost as if the whale is not diving into the ocean trench but a broader... universe.																						
104	104		301									It can no longer find its tribe, its kind, or even life.																						
105	105		301									And the whale is eventually torn apart by the gravity of the void. Its voice gradually fades until its last wail is silent.																						
106	106		301									The song ends. Ayla stops singing.																						
107	107		301									She gives Allen a brief moment to savor the aria before speaking again.

111	111		301							1	Ayla	Do you still remember Operation Red Tide, Chairman?	1																					
112	112		301								Allen	I do. That was her...	2																					
113	113		301									Allen does not finish. No one wants to be reminded how it ended.																						
114	114		301									Ayla does not continue his sentence as well. She keeps on going.																						
115	115		301								Ayla	During that operation, a scout from Strike Hawk recorded the song from the Corrupted... Siren, in order to compare it with our data.	1																					
116	116		301								Ayla	A long time after that, Babylonia's sonar detected a surprising recording. After checking, its sound wave closely resembles Siren's song.	1																					
117	117		301								Ayla	A... friend from the Task Force told me about that. I pulled some strings, hoping to get ahold of the recording... but what I got was an audio file with white noise and disordered sounds.	1																					
118	118		301								Ayla	But I had a feeling I know who sang that response.	1																					
119	119		301								Ayla	I repaired the audio file. It's a skill every member of the Archaeological Team knows.	1																					
120	120		301								Ayla	This song was what it ended up being.	1																					
121	121		301									As she says that, Ayla holds up her remote to her ear as if she can hear the whale song again.																						
122	122		301								Ayla	People from the Science Council told me it's impossible to detect and trace the source.	1																					
123	123		301								Ayla	For one thing, sonic waves decay, causing discrepancies in tracking. Our radar can only point at a general location. Secondly, it took time for the song to reach us. By the time we received the file, the singer could be long gone.	1																					
124	124		301								Ayla	We can't trace it, But I can't help but wonder who the singer might be. Did our receiver mistake white noise for a whale song? Was it an unknown machine playing music randomly? Or... was it a lament from a lonely blue whale left behind on Earth?	1																					
125	125		301								Ayla	The technicians gave me different theories, but I only believed in one of them.	1																					
126	126		301								Ayla	That was her signal. That was her whale song.																						
127	127		301									Ayla pauses again, looking at the sleeping frame beside her. There is a metallic iris blossoming on the frame's chest, an adornment for her performance.																						
128	128		301								Ayla	You might be wondering why I pushed for the development of this frame.	1																					
129	129		301								Ayla	It was because I wanted the whale song to continue. I want to use that song from Earth to make sure her voice doesn't end.	1																					
130	130		401							2	1515																							
131	131		301									Ayla turns on her terminal again, revealing a map before Allen. Several circles dotted the map like seeds spread onto the field.																						
132	132		301								Ayla	Whenever we located an area where her whale song appeared, I would imagine what she had experienced when she traveled there.	1																					
133	133		301								Ayla	Did she meet someone kind or dangerous? Would she encounter threatening tempests?	1																					
134	134		301								Ayla	Did she see the turfy mountains where the sheep nibbled? The banks with pioned and twilled brims? The... rainbow across the sky after the tempests?	1																					
135	135		301								Ayla	I put all these imaginations and sceneries along her journey into the Capriccio frame.	1																					
136	136		301								Ayla	If the person in my story walks the same path and meets the same people as the wanderer on the surface...	1																					
137	137		301								Ayla	Then, when she comes back, she will know that there has always been another whale song from Capriccio following her.	1																					
138	138		301								Ayla	She will know that someone out there in the stars has been humming her whale song, wishing her the best on the planet she loves so much.	1																					
139	139		301								Ayla	In the years to come, she will realize her journey wasn't alone when she looks back.	1																					
140	140		301								Ayla	She might chuckle, teasing me about how the character arcs of my story are wrong while we modify her frame together.	1																					
141	141		301								Ayla	I couldn't save her a few years ago. I can't find the whereabouts of that whale song now. The least I can do is give her a pleasant future.	1																					
142	142		301								Ayla	She gave me a soul with her Hamlet. This fragment of her soul has comforted me, so I must repay this kindness.	1																					
143	143		301								Allen	So you decided to write a story based on her past, didn't you?	2																					
144	144		301								Allen	You visited a few people who knew her during your time away from the saloon. I guessed that when you came to me with all your questions a few days ago.	2																					
145	145		301								Ayla	Nothing gets past you, Chairman.	1																					
146	146		301								Ayla	Her mind is so... alive. To recover her work, I had to find others to talk about what she was thinking back then.	1																					
147	147		301								Ayla	I was just surprised to find that commandant to be one of the people who knew her well... Oh, that's a secret. You didn't hear that.	1																					
148	148		301								Ayla	Regardless, I thought I knew her, but knowing the journey she has traveled now, I just... want to hold her and tell her how I feel.	1																					
149	149		204							1	8																							
150	150		301								Ayla	I want to tell her that the theater she wanted to visit on the surface has a replica here on Babylonia.																						
151	151		301								Ayla	I want to tell her that the opera she wrote is still well-loved. Many people l longing for the day it appears on the stage again. It's still the pride of her mother... and me.																						
152	152		301								Ayla	I want to tell her how many people are listening to the operas she recovered.																						
153	153		301								Ayla	I want to tell her that... the song she sang in that lonely space station has been found...																						
154	154		301								Ayla	I want to tell her I saw her pain and her strength... I saw her spirit quaking inside the tempest, bent but not broken.																						
155	155		204							1	4																							
156	156		301								Ayla	But she wasn't here... What else could I do?																						
157	157		301								Ayla	I... had to put them into this story!																						
158	158		301								Ayla	I started writing "Song of Flowers" when the signal of the whale song started heading toward the ruins of the Great Evacuation site.																						
159	159		301								Ayla	I came up with a story based on what happened when she was young, using conservation area 184 as a stage... But this time, I let her become a character in her own story as well.																						
160	160		301								Ayla	I mixed in a lot of different ideas and settings, but most of the characters in the story have real-life counterparts. Their names will be changed for the performance, obviously.	1																					
161	161		301								Allen	Counterparts... I guess the most obvious one was her father, Mr. Florance. He was a legend in WGAA.	2																					
162	162		301								Allen	A person in high places, he joined the fight after being inspired by art... until his honorable death on the field. What happened to him might have greatly affected his daughter, but it took a much bigger toll on his wife.	2

175	175		301							1	Ayla	She did become very repressed during that period of time.	1																					
176	176		301								Ayla	But Mrs. Florance stopped visiting counselors one day while still recovering pretty well afterward. The first time I saw her, she was with someone accepting, and her daughter was singing a lullaby with her. There was only love in her gaze.	1																					
177	177		301								Ayla	She worked hard for all of it.	1																					
178	178		301								Ayla	She talked to her mother for a very long time after that. I don't know what she said that changed her mother's mind, but she was allowed to study operas after that.	1																					
179	179		301								Ayla	One day, she "ran away" to this very theater. When her mother found her, she was performing Mr. Florance's last work as a one-person performance.	1																					
180	180		301								Ayla	It wasn't the first time she "ran away," but that was the only time she had the courage and the words to face her mother's pain.	1																					
181	181		301								Ayla	She said it was thanks to someone who found her performing alone during one of her escapes and offered her guidance.	1																					
182	182		301								Ayla	I don't know who he or she was... but if that person could see this performance, I hope the story will serve as my thanks.	1																					
183	183		204							2	1																							
184	184		301								Allen	Haha. I'm sure that person would see it if fate allows.	2																					
185	185		301								Ayla	Right... Another person on which I based one of my characters is Mr. Pieter, but I'm sure you've guessed it already.	1																					
186	186		301								Ayla	Even with all the talented people I've seen, he is still second to none. The operas he wrote have inspired many writers in WGAA, including her.	1																					
187	187		301								Ayla	I was surprised to find a famous playwright from the Golden Age buried in the army‚Äîwait, no. He stressed to me quite a few times that he wasn't "buried." This was his choice.	1																					
188	188		301								Ayla	It took me some effort to find him and tell him this story... and he agreed to help me with my script after seeing Selena's. I couldn't have finished this without his help.	1																					
189	189		204							2																								
190	190		301								Allen	And Pieter was one of the reasons why you came to me when your script was still unpolished, right?	2																					
191	191		301									Allen's timely interjection gives Ayla pause.																						
192	192		301									Ayla has been like a feral rabbit jumping around since Allen came here to listen to her story. She moves on from topic to topic, and he has acted like a patient guide, following and responding but never stopping her in her way.																						
193	193		301									But now, this guide has stepped ahead of the rabbit and planted a fence before her, stopping her from avoiding her past.																						
194	194		204							1	1																							
195	195		301								Ayla	Hah... I can't hide anything from you, can I? I didn't want to mention it.	1																					
196	196		301								Allen	Artists' eyes are sharp. You are quite insightful yourself.	2																					
197	197		204							1																								
198	198		301								Allen	But then, it wasn't hard to tell. I thought she was the protagonist of this story in the beginning, but there was a lack of her self-reflection in it. On the other hand, Pieter's role was very much highlighted.	2																					
199	199		301								Allen	It wasn't a wrong arrangement, per se, but it didn't feel like what a new writer like you would do.	2																					
200	200		202							1	2				1

204	204		301								Ayla	I didn't think I'd feel this way, but the first time I tried to write a story like that, I was drowned in that feeling.	1																					
205	205		301								Ayla	She would have called it...	1																					
206	206		301									Ayla raises a hand, moving it tentatively, seemingly trying to plug the right word from her M.I.N.D. Or perhaps she has found the word, but she is hesitant to say it.																						
207	207		301								Ayla	Lost.	1																					
208	208		301									After a while, she drops her hand.																						
209	209		301								Ayla	Right... Lost in the paints of my brushstrokes, in the words of my lines. They melt away from my canvas and fall from my script, traveling along my brush toward my arm, coagulating on my hand.	1																					
210	210		301								Ayla	Not that I never struggled to pick up my pen, but I never thought I would be a stranger to my canvas and my script. I can't even imagine what this painting and this play will look like when it's complete.	1																					
211	211		301								Ayla	I wondered many times what happened to her on the premiere of "The Acadia Evacuation" that put her on the battlefield.	1																					
212	212		301								Ayla	In the end, I attributed it to "pride"... That's my guess.	1																					
213	213		301								Ayla	But is that the truth? Their stories and their insights... have I understood them?	1																					
214	214		301								Ayla	Or have I twisted them so that I get the ending I wanted?	1																					
215	215		301								Ayla	Every time I step before my canvas, my head is filled with all these doubts.	1																					
216	216		301								Ayla	I started to lose sight of what her character would think in my story.	1																					
217	217		301								Ayla	So I avoided writing what she thought and just had her push the plot forward blindly.	1																					
218	218		301								Ayla	I wanted to ask Mr. Pieter for help, but I just found out that his transmission was lost near a conservation area... It was conservation area 184, near the evacuation site, where the whale song was last heard.	1																					
219	219		301								Ayla	I was even more lost after I heard the news.	1																					
220	220		301								Ayla	To be honest, I haven't made any changes since I wrote this ending. I've been trapped by this feeling for days.	1																					
221	221		301								Ayla	I can't take this... motionlessness anymore. All my muses will be gone if I don't talk to somebody.	1																					
222	222		301								Ayla	So say something, Chairman. I'm sick of drowning in this still water.	1																					
223	223		301									With that, the rabbit stops, standing still on the stage, reaching out for Allen, asking her guide to point her in the right direction.																						
224	224		301									And Allen already has an answer.																						
225	225		201							1	500111																							
226	226		301							1	Allen	Then, let me answer you with the scenes from your story.	1																					
227	227		301								Allen	Neither Flora, her father, Pieter, nor she was aware of the whole truth in your story. But they weren't motivated by truth.	1																					
228	228		301								Allen	They each set off on their path because they were inspired when they were moved by the stories they heard. Stories written by someone else.	1																					
229	229		301								Allen	That was their motivation. That was what drove their actions, am I right?	1																					
230	230		301								Allen	That was why you started writing this story, wasn't it?	1																					
231	231		201							1	500110																							
232	232		301							1	Ayla	Hmm...	1																					
233	233		201							1	500111																							
234	234		301							1	Allen	You visited the people she knew to learn about her story. If I guessed correctly, you have memorized every event and analyzed her character at each point in time.	1																					
235	235		301								Allen	You've walked her path, and you've looked into her bountiful heart. You know what kind of pressure made her lose her way, and you know how she held on when she was lost.	1																					
236	236		301								Allen	You said you had her push the plot forward blindly? No. You've made her come to life.	1																					
237	237		301								Allen	If this is just a story with a happy ending, then it would have ended with the two Constructs entering the theater and saving Flora.	1																					
238	238		301								Allen	But you had Flora opposing her future self, inspiring and freeing each other. I think she would have chosen the same if she saw her past self as well.	1																					
239	239		301								Allen	Perhaps a story where a person's past and future selves meet won't happen in real life, but you have given each of your characters a soul, and they have all expressed themselves to the fullest.	1																					
240	240		301								Allen	Maybe you didn't create her completely. But then, you know full well that the complete her doesn't belong in a story.	1																					
241	241		301								Allen	This is enough. If they can express how you feel, that is enough.	1																					
242	242		301								Allen	I think she would say the same if she were here.	1																					
243	243		301								Allen	"You already created the work you wanted to make, Ayla."	1																					
244	244		201							1	500110																							
245	245		301							1	Ayla	...Is that so?	1																					
246	246		301								Ayla	Please excuse me for a second, Chairman.	1																					
247	247		201							1	500111																							
248	248		301							1	Allen	Of course.	1																					
249	249		202							1	2				1																			
250	250		301									Allen nods, and Ayla turns silent, taking a deep breath.																						
251	251		301									The "excuse me" is not just because Ayla needs to stop the conversation. She also needs to create the right environment.

258	258		301									Ayla waves her hand, and the lights of the theatre turn off on her command one by one. Darkness spreads from the audience to the stage, stopping at a ray of light.																						
259	259		301									Ayla stands in the middle of the spotlight as if she is the source of light.																						
260	260		301									Ayla is always good at turning strange environments into her working space. Right now, the single ray of the spotlight in the dark has provided her with a small studio for her to think.																						
261	261		301									Ayla would probably feel too embarrassed to do this if someone else was in the audience. The sudden darkness can be, after all, quite uncomfortable.																						
262	262		301									But Allen seems to be used to Ayla doing this by now. He looks pleased instead of dismayed as he watches the rabbit standing inside the spotlight, her head raised.																						
263	263		201							1	500110																							
264	264		301							1	Ayla	(Exhales) ...	1																					
265	265		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Ayla does not focus on the dark. She follows the slowly unveiling stars and turns her gaze to the window walls of the theater.

269	269		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						A whole window of stars fills her eyes.																						
270	270		502							RImgBg1BlowUp																								
271	271		301									Once, Ayla would see that starry night and find it boring.																						
272	272		301									Those stars are so far away. Only one can actually reach her, and who knows how long ago its light started traveling.																						
273	273		301									The stars burn themselves so brightly, casting their photons into space in all directions.																						
274	274		301									The photons travel far and long, sailing forward in the cold for ages until they hit a surface, imprinting the brief image of their stars before getting reflected and scattered. By then, those stars might already have burnt out and died.																						
275	275		301									Would the stars have expected a response for their light? Is a response even possible?																						
276	276		301									Right now, looking at the countless, lonely stars out there, Ayla suddenly feels a sense of gratitude.																						
277	277		301									Unlike them, the light she casts is so much closer to her, almost reachable.																						
278	278		301									That light is cast on the blue planet below her, and she is gently singing.																						
279	279		301									Ayla has created this story. It focuses all her inspiration and gives life to the girl in her story.																						
280	280		301									Ayla's starlight and her longing have been cast on Earth. One day, they will reach the girl.																						
281	281		301									How long will that take? A day? A month? Years? Ayla does not know. Her light does not have to travel lightyears, but it has to traverse uncertainty.																						
282	282		301									Thinking about that, Ayla raises her hands. The studio terminal awakes once more, opening a holographic display before her under her commands.																						
283	283		301									She swipes across the display, hoping to open the map with the trails of the whale song. Instead, a photo of a smiling girl standing among bushes of flowers appears before Ayla.																						
284	284		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Ayla	Selena...

287	287		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						She says the girl's name in a daze.																						
288	288		301									The girl among the flowers smiles at Ayla.																						
289	289		301									The same way the girl smiled when she left Ayla.																						
290	290		301									This is an imprint of the moment before the girl left. Ayla takes its light and reflects it back to Earth.																						
291	291		301									When will the slow-walking, quietly-humming star see her light?																						
292	292		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					When that happens... will these two stars that have illuminated each other look the same?																						
293	293		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
294	294		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						‚ÄîThe distance of time, is it? Right... it is a shame, then. But even lost civilizations leave behind traces. They would have a long time to appreciate the marks we left behind.																						
295	295		301									‚ÄîAs long as we keep looking, the light of our art still travels across the universe... Then one day we will meet.																						
296	296		301									‚ÄîFor a second, the lines Ayla wrote echo within her.																						
297	297		301									Why? She wrote those words, but why does she only understand them now?																						
298	298		301									The gaze that travels between the display and the starry night lands on the sleeping girl in the chamber unintentionally.																						
299	299		301								Ayla	...Hah. Of course. Because I didn't write them all by myself.																						
300	300		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The girl's quiet smile has given Ayla the answer.																						
301	301		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cgqz2902.jpg																								
302	302		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						That line was not entirely Ayla's work.																						
303	303		301									They were the girl's words, written through Ayla from a memory.																						
304	304		301									Ayla's fingers linger on the terminal, touching her painting. For a brief moment there, her hand seems to travel through the canvas and reaches the field of flowers thousands of miles away.																						
305	305		301									‚ÄîIf she cannot tell how far it is, then she will keep shining until her light reaches the girl's eyes.																						
306	306		301									So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, so long lives this and this gives life to thee.																						
307	307		301									Ayla takes a deep breath again and raises her hand.

314	314		301								Ayla	I'm feeling much better.	1

319	319		301								Allen	How do the folks in the saloon say it... "This is the smile of the blunt, unclouded Ayla, who puts all of herself on her canvas!"	2																					
320	320		301								Ayla	Haha! No way, your imitation is perfect!	1																					
321	321		301								Ayla	I'll visit the saloon after I'm done polishing this script. Please send them my regards when you visit them.	1																					
322	322		301								Allen	Of course.	2																					
323	323		301								Ayla	Well... I still have another problem to consider... How should I do the background story? Maybe I can put it online so the audience can read them for free...	1

325	325		301								Ayla	Oh, hold on, I got it. Need to do it more cleverly...	1

327	327		301									Ayla jumps down the stage in a few steps, dashing out of the theater to her actual studio.

346	346		301								Allen	Young Selena... When I met her here, I wasn't that mature a writer either, and my comments barely held water. I didn't expect it would inspire her.	1																					
347	347		301									For a moment, Allen seems to find himself back in the field of flowers years ago, when he was also like a rabbit, running on the field unrestricted, followed by a gentle guide who watches him with a similar gaze to his now.																						
348	348		301								Allen	Ha. Seeds planted unexpectedly have now grown into an ocean of flowers.	1
