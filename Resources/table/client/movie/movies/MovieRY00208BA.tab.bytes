5	5		301									Pouting, Nanami swings her chainsaw around, and all the abnormal programs dare not approach her.																						
6	6		201							1	500324																							
7	7		301							1	Queen Program	Our kind must obtain physical bodies<//AVATAR> before Gestalt<//CAGE> removes us. We will replace the arrogant Constructs' minds and become whole.	1																					
8	8		301								Queen Program	And all of us here need you, Nanami<//#%?#%?>... We all want to be your friends<//??SEE??>...	1																					
9	9		301									The flocking programs are all speaking nonsense and bowing to Nanami.

15	15		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Hat-wearing Program	Ladies and gentlemen, this is the end of the line. Remember to bring your belongings with you, especially the socks! Don't forget the socks!																						
16	16		301									The hat-wearing program bows to Chrome and points to the square before them. There he finds a large crowd of abnormal programs gathering together, alongside some panicking external consciousnesses.																						
17	17		201							1	500155																							
18	18		301							1	Chrome	Why are you helping us?	1																					
19	19		301								Hat-wearing Program	Why, why... Why is a raven like a writing desk?																						
20	20		301								Chrome	I'm sorry‚Äîwhat?	1																					
21	21		301								Hat-wearing Program	You don't know the answer, which means you aren't mad‚Äîthat's good! The world doesn't need more madmen. You don't need it, and we don't need it either.																						
22	22		301									Chrome shakes his head and looks at you, confused.																						
23	23		302								Don't look at me. I don't know either.	24																						
24	24		201							1	500212																							
25	25		301							1	Lee	We should KEEP wasting time and NOT destroy those abnormal programs!	1																					
26	26		201							1	500155																							
27	27		301							1	Chrome	Huh? Oh... right. Our priority should be rescuing Nanami. What's happening right now must be connected to those programs capturing her.	1																					
28	28		302								That makes sense.	29																						
29	29		202							1	2				1																			
30	30		301									But before you all charge the enemies, you see the abnormal programs parting, and among them is the Queen Program and Nanami walking together slowly, hand in hand.																						
31	31		201							1	500091	1																						
32	32		301							1	Nanami	Did you... did you come here to get Nanami?	1																					
33	33		301									Nanami seems to want to run toward you, but the Queen Program puts a hand on her shoulder and holds her back.																						
34	34		201							1	500324																							
35	35		301							1	Queen Program	Do not hurry. Maybe they<//FLUTE> don't really want you to return to the real world<//NEW WORLD>?	1																					
36	36		201							1	500091	5																						
37	37		301							1	Nanami	H-how's that possible?!	1																					
38	38		201							1	500324																							
39	39		301							1	Queen Program	You have brought them much trouble on this April Fool's Day<//CELEBRATE>. Perhaps they no longer see you as a friend<//??SEE??>...	1																					
40	40		201							1	500322																							
41	41		301							1	Lucia	That's RIGHT! We DO mind! Nanami, we DON'T want you back!	1																					
42	42		201							1	500091	14																						
43	43		301							1	Nanami	Do... do you hate Nanami that much, Lucia?	1																					
44	44		201							1	500321																							
45	45		301							1	Liv	YES! We'll ALWAYS hate Nanami! EVERYONE thinks you're annoying! Aargh‚Äî	1																					
46	46		301									Liv tries to stop talking when she realizes how she sounds, but she is too late.																						
47	47		201							1	500091	14																						
48	48		301								Nanami	Lee, Nanami has brought you so much trouble... You must hate Nanami as well...	1																					
49	49		201							1	500212																							
50	50		301							1	Lee	...	1																					
51	51		301									Lee knows he cannot possibly explain himself, so he instead chooses not to say anything. But to Nanami, it seems like Lee is just silently acknowledging what she has said.																						
52	52		201							1	500155																							
53	53		301							1	Chrome	It's not like that... Nanami, they are...	1																					
54	54		201							1	500091	14																						
55	55		301							1		Nanami shakes her head and steps back, her expression devastated.																						
56	56		301								Nanami	If no one likes Nanami, then maybe Nanami should stay here... At least the programs here said they needed me. They said they wanted to be my friend...	1																					
57	57		302								Nanami!	58																						
58	58		201							1	500324																							
59	59		301							1		Before your voice reaches Nanami, the massive Queen Program stands in your way.																						
60	60		301								Queen Program	Of course these people are the enemies who hate Nanami<//#%?#%?>, which means they are our enemies as well... We shall remove you from here...	1
