13	13		301								Noan	I spent some time with the Gray Raven Commandant outside.	2																					
14	14		301								Palma	Can't you think of some other excuses for being late?	1																					
15	15		301								Noan	Um, I was asked to bring this cookie from Zone L to Commandant Simon.	2

19	19		301								Simon	Noan, I have already heard about the incident in the morning.	1																					
20	20		301								Simon	They contacted me the moment you were brought over. After all...	1																					
21	21		301								Noan	Will you be held accountable if something really happens?	2																					
22	22		301									Simon nods in silence.																						
23	23		301								Simon	So I went to check with Chief before you came back.	1																					
24	24		301								Noan	...	2																					
25	25		301								Simon	I'm not going to blame you. It wasn't your fault. Even if you tried to hide it from me... I know you just didn't want me to worry.	1																					
26	26		301								Simon	Still, I wish you can tell me and trust me if possible. We are teammates, after all.	1

29	29		301							1	Palma	Teammates? Really? Your attitude betrays you. Noan and you are actually identical in some way. You both look so kind and helpful, but you always shut people out. It's impossible to talk to you.	1																					
30	30		204							2	9																							
31	31		301								Noan	What?	2																					
32	32		301								Palma	Don't you realize it? Sometimes, you look like you are so concerned about passing your trouble to others. So you always keep a distance from people.	1																					
33	33		204							2	11																							
34	34		301								Noan	I think you are no different in that aspect.	2																					
35	35		301								Palma	Tsk.	1																					
36	36		301								Noan	But Commandant Simon isn't like what you said.	2																					
37	37		301								Palma	Alright, fine. Everything is a mission.	1

54	54		301									Simon gives one of the cookies back to Noan.																						
55	55		301								Noan	Gift?	2																					
56	56		301									To him, the cookie was just a piece of food that commandant casually handed over. It carries no special meaning and should be given to someone who appreciates it more.																						
57	57		301								Noan	As a Construct, I no longer need to eat. You should have it. I remember you said it tasted good.	2																					
58	58		301								Simon	...Is this your habit?	1																					
59	59		301								Noan	What?	2																					
60	60		301								Simon	You are too used to showing your kindness, even if something is supposed to be yours.	1																					
61	61		301								Noan	But...	2																					
62	62		204							2	16																							
63	63		301									It's just a piece of cookie.																						
64	64		204							2																								
65	65		301								Simon	I brought this up not just because of the cookie, but of all the things that happened lately.	1																					
66	66		301									He lets out a sigh as if he can read Noan's facial expression.																						
67	67		301								Simon	You are always easy to approach and gentle. Whether you are treated kindly or badly, you can accept it with ease.	1																					
68	68		301								Simon	When you first came to Dark Aries, I felt you were just like a lake.	1																					
69	69		301								Simon	I felt like all those observations and experiments were stones thrown into a lake. After some splashes and ripples, there was no further reaction.	1																					
70	70		301								Simon	Maybe that's your strength... That is how you are able to stay calm until now.	1																					
71	71		301								Simon	Unlike Palm... Um, I mean it's easier for me to talk to you.	1

77	77		201							2	500506		400																					
78	78		301							1	Simon	But that also gradually alienates you from other people.	1																					
79	79		301								Noan	...Me?	2																					
80	80		301								Simon	I'm not blaming you. I know you don't want to see this happen.	1																					
81	81		301								Simon	The affiliation with Ascendants, the abnormality in your frame, even the rumors in ACA related to the name "Noan"...	1																					
82	82		301								Simon	Compared with all that, I prefer to trust my own decision after spending all this time with you.	1																					
83	83		301									There is a hint of bitterness in Simon's tone. He never purposely keeps a distance from Noan, but his mission and duty force him to always be on guard.																						
84	84		301								Simon	I tried to stop them from monitoring or suspecting you. Sorry, I couldn't change anything in the end...	1																					
85	85		301								Simon	I know I'm probably asking too much, but I don't want you to lose yourself in this stressful environment.	1																					
86	86		301								Simon	You shouldn't be treated that way. You were a hero who saved them...	1																					
87	87		301								Noan	It's okay, I understand. There are too many unknowns and abnormalities in my frame. It's only a necessary precaution.	2																					
88	88		301								Simon	...	1																					
89	89		301								Simon	I can't really change anything.	1																					
90	90		301								Simon	But if someone can see the real you, and is able to disregard all the restrictions to lend you a hand...	1																					
91	91		301									He picks up the cookie and places it in Noan's hand solemnly.																						
92	92		301								Simon	I know eating is not necessary for Constructs. But even if it is only a small nice gesture...	1																					
93	93		301								Simon	Can you please not pass it on to others? It's not a stone thrown into the lake.	1																					
94	94		301								Noan	...	2																					
95	95		301								Simon	Otherwise, you would be rejecting someone that is willing to believe in you.	1																					
96	96		301								Noan	I see.	2

100	100		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		After the regular meeting, Noan stays back alone in the preparation room of Dark Aries. Looking at the cookie in his hand, he gets lost in thought.																						
101	101		301									It is not a rare treasure to the humans living in Babylonia.																						
102	102		301									The cookie is made in the shape of a smiley bear, with colorful candies on it. It is sealed in a transparent, shiny box.																						
103	103		301									In the old days... Whether he was in the lower cabin levels or wandering, he could only get very limited food.																						
104	104		301									Most people could hardly find enough things to eat, let alone make them in such a delicate form.																						
105	105		301									Before he came here, Noan had never seen any food like this.																						
106	106		301									All the instant soup, cans, hardtack or even grass and bark he gathered were nowhere near tasty. He was only eating to survive.																						
107	107		301									When Noan became a Construct, he was truly delighted because he no longer needed to eat, nor would he ever suffer from hunger. He could finally give his food to others who needed them more.																						
108	108		301									Give non-essential supplies to those who need it most. This is the principle that Noan learned from the crowd. Back then, they must help one another to survive.																						
109	109		301									So he did not hesitate at all when giving the cookie to Simon.																						
110	110		204							1																								
111	111		301								Noan	It's a... gift...	1																					
112	112		301									If accepting this gesture of kindness can earn him a moment of relief in this abyss of depression...																						
113	113		301								Noan	...	1																					
114	114		301									He opens the delicate box. Before he can take out the cookie inside, a note drops out.																						
115	115		301								Noan	...?	1																					
116	116		301									Is this why Simon insisted to return the cookie to him?																						
117	117		301									Slightly confused, he picks up the folded note. There is a line of small text on it.																						
118	118		304				AniZhuanchangBegin			â€”Nobody will forbid you from drawing here. Your work is beautiful. Please don't throw it away.	000000ff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1			1

121	121		301									Noan falls into a long silence staring at the note.																						
122	122		301									After what seems an eternity, he finally understands that all his actionsâ€”giving food to others, hiding his drawings, responding to hatred and rumors with kindnessâ€”all have one reason behind them.																						
123	123		301								Noan	...I'm still trapped in my old habits.	1

125	125		301									He already made up his mind to take this opportunity to embrace a new future.																						
126	126		301									But once he finds himself in an environment where he is watched and monitored, the self-defense instincts that he once gave up have come back again.
