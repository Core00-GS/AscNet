15	15		301								Jin Man	You might not think I was being serious, but I wasn't completely joking... You're worth the admission fee. There's no reason for you to risk going back to Kowloong. Who knows what that place looks like now?	2																					
16	16		301								Jin Man	Even if you're doing it for the girl... Why would you let her leave? The Nighter is the safest place to be for her...	2																					
17	17		301								Hanying	We can't all be as good as you when it comes to bartering and bargaining, Mr. Jin Man... Not to mention that we all define the "values" of our lives differently.	1

19	19		301								Jin Man	Hmph... Whatever. That's all I have to say. At the end of the day, I'm just a businessman looking for the best deal for me... I don't care what you do with your purchase as long as you can pay the price.	2																					
20	20		301									Jin Man takes a letter from his pockets, contemplating for a second before handing it to Hanying.																						
21	21		301								Jin Man	I've arranged the shuttle boat you need... It'll be waiting for you at the stern of the ship in three days when dawn breaks, disguised as a small cargo vessel. Hand this letter to the captain once you board it, and say nothing, understood?	2																					
22	22		301								Jin Man	You can pay me the rest of the fee once you're back on the shores of Kowloong.	2

37	37		301									She had encountered enthusiastic fans before who caused her occasional troubles—nothing alarming for the Nighter.																						
38	38		301									But this is different. The group looking for her includes half a dozen individuals instead of just a lone wolf or two... and they are not all humans. There are mechanoids and Constructs among them.

53	53		301									As the forks are still tangled, Hanying, having leaped into the air, pounces from the ceiling, launching herself at one of the men and landing forcefully on his hand with the pitchfork. He collapses before he can scream.																						
54	54		301									Since the pitchforks are interlocked, Hanying's plunge drives all of their weapons downward. With leverage, she launches several men back, sending them flying in all directions.																						
55	55		301			RImgBg1Shake						A female mechanoid also in a bamboo hat kicks the figures flying toward her back to Hanying. Despite knowing their ill intentions, Hanying still catches them by their collars and gently tosses them aside.

60	60		301							1	Hanying	Your foundation is lacking—	1																					
61	61		301									With a smile, Hanying bends backward, supporting herself with her arms. Dodging her assailant's claws with a backflip, she kicks the mechanoid right in the jaw with her raised feet, launching her assailant into the air in one swift, graceful dance-like move.																						
62	62		204							1	4																							
63	63		301								Hanying	Time to show yourself.	1																					
64	64		301									As Hanying stands on her feet, the mechanoid she kicked flies straight toward a rockery in the garden, shattering the small mountain into stones that bury the immobile mechanoid—and revealing the person hiding behind.

95	95		301							1	Hanying	...Who exactly are you?	1																					
96	96		301									The man cannot help but chuckle. He grips her hand tightly, and her pearl-white skin turns red under his forceful grasp.																						
97	97		201							1	500148																							
98	98		301							1	"Cradle"	Such magnificent craftsmanship. No wonder you're confident enough to pretend to be a human... What a masterpiece by Lord Villier.	1																					
99	99		301									Hearing that name, Hanying's pupils immediately constrict. Before his mechanoid companions can react, Hanying is already gripping the man by his throat.

103	103		301								"Cradle"	We are members of "Cradle"... or we were.	1																					
104	104		301									Hanying has heard of this name from Villier in the past. A malicious hacker group formed in Kowloong, Cradle was responsible for the attack on the Kowloong monarchy, which ended with Villier eradicating the group.																						
105	105		301								"Cradle"	It seems that he has shared quite a few secrets with you... which is just lovely. The more secrets of him we know, the more vicious our vengeance will be.	1																					
106	106		301									He looks at the highest point of Kowloong, the tower upon which resides the man he has been hoping to exact revenge.																						
107	107		301								"Cradle"	"Cradle"... fears not death but that undignifying defeat. We shall take his life in the most shameful manner in response. For example... at the hand of his creation, you.	1																					
108	108		301								"Cradle"	In three days, the man pretending to be "Qu" will leave his tower. That is our chance to strike.	1																					
109	109		301								"Cradle"	Once Villier is dead... the Nighter, this jewel in this damned age, will be ours.	1																					
110	110		301									Hanying's grip grows tighter, but the man before her shows no fear as if Hanying is the one whose life is at stake.																						
111	111		301								"Cradle"	You didn't kill me the first time because of the girl; you're not going to kill me now. You cannot deviate from your programming, you poor machine.	1																					
112	112		301								"Cradle"	Why a machine by Villier would show concern for a human girl does pique my curiosity, though, as an engineer myself.	1																					
113	113		301			RImgBg1Shake						Yoyo screams at that moment. The thug in the bamboo hat is pushing the tip of the knife slowly into her leg, and red, warm blood spills out gradually.																						
114	114		301								Hanying	...!	2

124	124		301								"Cradle"	The code signature we found in Villier's secret workshop in Kowloong was indeed correct... Your hardware might be impressive, but your software is barely secured.	1																					
125	125		301								"Cradle"	Did you make this "collar" yourself as well? How intricate. Is this how you've managed to stay among the humans? But the more intricate a thing is, the more fragile it is.	1																					
126	126		301								Hanying	D-don't...	2																					
127	127		301									All the secrets Hanying has been guarding, the treasures she has been collecting, are now wantonly revealed.																						
128	128		301								"Cradle"	...So that's what Villier's trying to do. How ridiculous! He's not right in the head either, is he? Hahaha!	1																					
129	129		301								"Cradle"	You're just another worthless puppet he threw away... Don't you despise him? But I suppose you can only feel what you were programmed to feel.	1																					
130	130		301									As the man goes through Hanying's memories like a hyena that has tasted blood, a small pebble hits him in the back. It does not injure him, but it does make him turn around.

147	147		301								"Cradle"	Now, tell her why you saved a little girl in the beginning.	1
