157	157		301									At the center of the high wall is a rudimentary but heavy gate. Scattered before the gate—																						
158	158		301									—Stands a crowd of mechanoids arranged in smaller groups.																						
159	159		301									But this appears only temporary. The smaller groups of mechanoids assemble into a larger collective.																						
160	160		301									Two groups form a squad, three squads form a platoon, and three platoons form a company...																						
161	161		301									You observe the mechanoids for five minutes as they spontaneously form several companies. Each predetermined commander carves identification marks on themselves with stones.

179	179		301									The mechanoids raise their fists in a display of force with their commanders before forming a large battalion and marching out.																						
180	180		301									—Within the space of twenty minutes, you have witnessed the formation and departure of an army.																						
181	181		301									Except for a few stragglers left to guard the gate, there is hardly any trace of the army that has just formed.																						
182	182		301									—Perhaps, this is a characteristic of mechanoids. Without the need for supplies, their strength is in numbers.
