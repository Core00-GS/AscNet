3	2		301							1	???	I can't thank you enough!																						
4	3		302								You're Komori, right?	4																						
5	4		301							1	Komori	Yes! And you must have been sent by Sagawa!																						
6	5		301							1	Komori	If it weren't for you, we would never have made it back in one piece...																						
7	6		301							1	Komori	These parts are getting more dangerous by the day...																						
8	7		301							1	Komori	Sagawa always wants us to move to somewhere else, but the elder always opposes the idea.																						
9	8		301							1	Komori	If even the elder's son can't change his father's mind, what chance do we have...																						
10	9		201							1	1031001																							
11	10		301							1	Liv	I see... so that's why Sagawa said he was going to "force his father's hand," huh?	1																					
12	11		301							1	Komori	What? He said that?																						
13	12		202							1																								
14	13		301							1	Komori	Does that mean... Oh, crap!																						
15	14		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1		As if alarmed by some bad news, Komori turns on her heel and runs off.																						
16	15		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Komori	Sagawa!																						
17	16		301							1		When you follow Komori back to the Towerfolk settlement, you see Sagawa tied up like a bundle.																						
18	17		301							1		...Surrounded by Towerfolk citizens who are armed and on the alert.																						
19	23		301							1	Sagawa	...																						
20	24		301							1	???	Credit where credit is due. You managed to get Babylonia to send us help...																						
21	25		301							1	???	But trying to get Towerfolk citizens to leave the tower is a serious crime.																						
22	26		301							1	???	You must be punished, if not by death then by pain!																						
23	27		301							1	Sagawa	Come on, let's face it! The Corrupted have their eyes on this place!																						
24	28		301							1	Sagawa	If we don't leave soon, we'll all be dead!																						
25	29		301							1	Elder	Occasional harassment is not going to kill us... And as soon as the KCC's mercs get here...																						
26	30		301							1	Sagawa	Stop kidding yourself! Our last two years' harvest will barely pay for those mercs!																						
27	31		301							1	Towerfolk Citizen	Elder! The Corrupted have penetrated the outer barrier!																						
28	32		301							1	Elder	What?!																						
29	33		302								Wake up to reality.	34																						
30	34		301							1	Elder	So what... We don't even have time to pack our things.																						
31	35		301							1		If we leave the tower like this... our lives will be doomed.																						
32	36		302								Babylonia will help.	37																						
33	37		301							1	Elder	...																						
34	38		301							1	Elder	Go knock on the door of every household! Tell them to pack their most valuable belongings. We're leaving!
