35	32		301							1		With some difficulty, Gabriel uses his cane to prop himself up.																						
36	33		301								Gabriel	Humans and their despicable behavior have always been the bane of our existence. If we do not turn to the great power of the Ascension-Network for help, how would the world be saved?	1																					
37	34		201							1	500100

74	71		301									Their weapons clash again, and Gabriel's first three quick strikes are blocked by the katana. Just before Gabriel can deliver his final pulverizing swing, however, Alpha flashes out of range.																						
75	72		201							1	500179																							
76	73		301							1	Gabriel	Haven't you learned your lesson from what happened in the Arctic?	1

81	78		301									Alpha responds as she stabs at Gabriel's chest from the right. He quickly flies up, avoiding the attack, though the low ceiling limits his movement.																						
82	79		201							1	500100																							
83	80		301							1	α	The main reason Luna wants to move the filtering forward is because she believes it's the only way to preserve the lives of at least some people.	1																					
84	81		301								α	When the filtering is complete, the weak will be corrupted by the Punishing Virus, while the Ascendants will bring a new beginning to the world.	1																					
85	82		301								α	Although I have no interest in the filtering, nor in Ascnet, I support the future she's chosen.	1																					
86	83		301								α	And you... you're just a lunatic who claims to serve Ascnet and the filtering, but really just wants to consolidate power for himself.	1																					
87	84		301								α	How are you any different from the humans?	1																					
88	85		202							1					1																			
89	86		301									She sheathes her katana and strides toward Gabriel, concentrating all her energy into the tip of her blade.																						
90	87		201							1	500179																							
91	88		301							1	Gabriel	If we get more power from the Ascension-Network, the humans will have no choice but to surrender! To reach this goal, any sacrifice is worth it.	1																					
92	89		201							1	500100																							
93	90		301							1	α	A despot with an insatiable craving for power has but one end—to be torn apart by those under your thumb.	1																					
94	91		301								α	I'll say this again. The road you've chosen has but one ending—absolutely nothing!	1																					
95	92		201							1	500179																							
96	93		301							1	Gabriel	It seems we can't come to a consensus. Well then, give me everything you've got!	1																					
97	94		301								Gabriel	Just as how I loathe your ridiculous feelings, you too wish to deny my ideals and aspirations.	1

99	96		301									Red circuits course through Gabriel's body, turning his wings blood red. As he hovers, each flap of his wings causes the unstable walls around them to tremble.

104	101		301									Gabriel looks down at the dust and smoke, thinking of what someone told him.

108	105		301									Just as he is turning around to leave, a multitude of shimmering blade-like beams bursts forth from where Gabriel's attacks were concentrated, shooting toward the gloating "angel" high above.																						
109	106		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The beams tear through him, sending him plummeting.																						
110	107		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cg1901_3.jpg																								
111	108		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Once the dust settles... Alpha finds Gabriel's remains among the destroyed walls.																						
112	109		301									His mechanical parts lie beneath the pale white light, the energy not yet dissipated causing them to twitch among the rubble.																						
113	110		301									The word "immortality" that was carved on his body was torn apart by the blade beam, whispering its master's unfinished ambition.																						
114	111		301									Those memories of the past buried deep and never talked about...																						
115	112		301									Those long-held aspirations, prejudice, and unspoken feelings...																						
116	113		301									Have all died together with the unknown origins of his name.																						
117	114		301									The remnants of what was once an angel struggles in his death throes, forcing his last hoarse words through the damaged voice module...																						
118	115		301								Gabriel	... not long before filtering... soon born...																						
119	116		301									But he has not even finished his last words before using up his last bit of energy and returns to a deathly stillness.																						
120	117		301								α	...																						
121	118		301									Alpha does not say anything and leaves for her next destination.																						
122	119		301									Her silvery hair flutters in the wind, revealing the team insignia that is usually obscured by her long hair and rarely noticed.																						
123	120		301									If the filtering that Ascnet has implemented is meant to be accompanied by blood and battle...																						
124	121		301									... The path Gabriel has chosen ultimately led to his funeral.																						
125	122		301									Did he fall victim to his own beliefs on a path he chose?																						
126	123		301								α	Farewell, you crazy martyr.																						
127	124		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					A breeze wafts through the sewers, lifting the hem of Alpha's outfit, as the darkness gradually envelops her figure.																						
128	125		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
129	126		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						While no one may know from whence the wind blows, or where it is headed, there will always be traces of what existed here.																						
130	127		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					After Alpha has disappeared into the distance, a golden-eyed girl quietly hugs the head that once stored Gabriel's memory...
