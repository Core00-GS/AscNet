43	46		301								α	Forsaken and the Forest Guard have aroused an offensive...																						
44	49		301								Luna	That's good enough. You can head back, Sis. Let them come.																						
45	52		301								α	Sure. If I keep fighting, I don't know how much longer I can hold back.																						
46	53		301								α	Is your work... finished?																						
47	56		301								Luna	Yes. I got the antennas buried in the pillars, just as Huaxu said.																						
48	59		301								α	I see.																						
49	60		301								α	Yet, you don't look... pleased.																						
50	63		301								Luna	Just witnessing stupidity... as always.																						
51	66		301								α	Is that so?																						
52	69		301								Luna	Tell the others to retreat, and I'll catch up with you later.																						
53	72		301								α	I've already contacted Roland and Lamia, who will be stopping the attackers in other directions. But Gabriel...																						
54	75		301								Luna	We can leave him. I'll retreat shortly after.

56	80		301									Closing the communications link, Luna silently surveys the wave of destruction left in her wake.																						
57	81		301									Why go so far? Her M.I.N.D. echoes with confusion that had been festering since the onset.																						
58	83		301								Luna	Huaxu.																						
59	84		301								Huaxu	Yes?																						
60	85		301								Luna	Even after reading the information you showed me, I still can't understand what this so-called human possibility is.																						
61	86		301								Huaxu	As a population, humans are extremely complex creatures, which cannot be explained by a single definition.																						
62	87		301								Luna	That doesn't mean your analysis for Qu was correct.																						
63	88		301								Huaxu	Without further information, sender Luna is unwilling to explain the nature of Ascnet to assist in computing.																						
64	89		301								Luna	It's not something that you, made by humanity, can understand.																						
65	90		301								Luna	Alright, enough.																						
66	91		301								Huaxu	Sender Luna's question does not yield a valid response.																						
67	92		301								Luna	That will not be necessary.																						
68	93		301								Luna	The Ascnet is the only way forward.																						
69	94		301								Luna	Only those who can share their power with me... Are qualified to live here once all of this is over.

79	104		301								Hassen	You mean... She had an ulterior motive?	2																					
80	105		301								Nikola	We don't know exactly what they're trying, but judging from previous behavior, that seems likely.	1																					
81	106		301								Hassen	Other than this, there's something I'm more concerned about...	2																					
82	107		301									Hassen taps a few times on the control panel. It seems to have loaded a filter template.

87	112		301								Hassen	The direction is different, I understand. But it serves the same purpose.	2																					
88	113		301									Nikola does not respond. Instead, he makes some adjustments on the control panel, sorting the energy distribution of the highlighted areas throughout the entirety of the battle along a time axis chart.																						
89	114		301									After staring at the chart for quite some time, Nikola stands up as if something had come to mind.
