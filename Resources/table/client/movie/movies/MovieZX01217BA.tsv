11	10		301									Standing at the corner of the street is a familiar-looking Phecda. Before Chrome could identify the figure, Kamui has already realized that it was the Phecda they saved in the industrial zone.

39	28		301								Phecda B	Because they saved us before.	1																					
40	29		301									"We aren't disobeying orders, we are repaying kindness." Thus replies the Phecda.																						
41	30		301								Phecda B	Our belief is to save everything that has value. Though Babylonia might walk a different path, are not their brave warriors, fighting on the streets, valuable?	1																					
42	31		301								Phecda B	And that belief in value is what unites us as a community. So, hey, you all are gonna help out, yeah?	1

70	53		301									Another of Lamia's feats—decompressing the virus within her to create a zone of such viral density, that even her surroundings fog up.
