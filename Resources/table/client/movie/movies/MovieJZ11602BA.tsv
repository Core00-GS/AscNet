9	9		301							1	Shady Merchant	Hey, lady, cute kid you got there! Bit of a waste to send him off in the "wagon," no? How about let me take him off your hands—at a premium, even! I know you ladies have it rough on this boat—	1																					
10	10		301								Woman	You getting ideas on my kid now?! Get the hell away before you piss me off!																						
11	11		301								Shady Merchant	Whoa, easy! There's no need to be uncivilized...	1																					
12	12		301								Child	Pffffftt!!!																						
13	13		301									The boy pulls a face at the shady merchant as his mother drags him away.

27	27		301								Shady Merchant	Business? Does it look like a candy shop here, kid?	2																					
28	28		204							1																								
29	29		301									Changyu quickly scans his surroundings, making sure no mechanoid guards are patrolling nearby. He removes the bag from his waist.																						
30	999		301									It is a most ordinary purse, identical to the one the merchant has on his stall. But Changyu is holding it more cautiously than one would a child, carefully unzipping the bag before the merchant's eyes.																						
31	30		301								Shady Merchant	I said get lost—what the hell... Is this... A Construct?!	2																					
32	31		301								Changyu	Shush! The Kowloong Crew's gonna confiscate it if they find out!	1																					
33	32		301								Shady Merchant	How did you...	2																					
34	33		301									The merchant coughs and lowers his voice, trying to sound calm and collected.																						
35	34		301								Shady Merchant	How did you get your hands on a Receptor? Where does it come from?	2																					
36	35		204							1	1																							
37	36		301								Changyu	I'm just the errand boy—my employer is a pretty private person, so I'm acting as his eyes and ears. And from what I've heard, you're the most reputable vendor in these parts.	1																					
38	37		301								Shady Merchant	You bet! You're in luck, kid, 'cause your new buddy Todd here is the fairest merchant of them all!	2																					
39	38		301									The shady merchant reaches for Changyu's bag as he speaks.																						
40	39		301								Shady Merchant	Now, the fair thing to do is to inspect the goods first...	2																					
41	40		204							1	5																							
42	41		301								Changyu	Hey!	1																					
43	42		301									Changyu clenches the bag in his hands, his face filled with suspicion.																						
44	43		301								Changyu	Give us an offer, and you can inspect it all you want. This is just my first stop of the night—my employer told me to get a few more offers before making a deal...	1																					
45	44		301								Shady Merchant	Trust me, you won't be getting a better offer than mine!	2																					
46	45		301								Changyu	Really?	1																					
47	46		301								Shady Merchant	Enough with the dawdling—I thought you're here on business? So show me the merchandise!	2																					
48	47		301								Changyu	Fine, but you better be careful. The Receptor cost my employer a fortune. He just got it from a trader who arrived from the mainland...	1																					
49	48		301									The shady merchant has stopped listening to Changyu's babbling. His hand meticulously traces the horned contour of the Receptor, his eyes wide with awe and greed.

55	6325		202							1																								
56	52		301									The hysterical hawker sprints in the direction of Changyu, screaming and shouting as he nears. He is holding all his wares in his arms, the bits and pieces falling all over as he frantically runs.																						
57	53		301									The shouting causes a commotion in the black market.																						
58	54		301								Merchant A	What's with the Kowloong Crew? They never paid attention to the black market! Is some bigwig making deals here again?																						
59	55		301								Merchant B	Just pack up and bolt! I don't want my stuff confiscated like last time!																						
60	56		301								Complaining Merchant	Come on! It's my first day here!

77	72		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The door of the gambling den by the street corner slides open, and out slips a young man. Shoutings can be heard through the gap from the many stirring gambling heads.																						
78	73		301									Red and green lights flash intermittently from the three neon signs above the door. The center one writes "Fortune's Favor," while to its two sides sit "Give Fools Their Gold" and "And Knaves Their Power."																						
79	74		301									The beggar who frequents outside the gambling den greets the exiting young man.																						
80	75		201							1	500148

84	79		301									Without answering, Changyu grins and casually throws the beggar a grub. He catches it.																						
85	80		201							1	500148																							
86	81		301							1	Elderly Beggar	You're gonna get busted if you keep taking shortcuts through the den...	1																					
87	82		201							1	500216	1																						
88	83		301							1	Changyu	I know what I'm doing, old man. How about you stop worrying, and go grab some food instead? My treat.	1

95	3215		401							2	1504																							
96	90		301									Before Changyu can answer, a group of barefoot urchins comes running down the alley.																						
97	998		301									Like a well-oiled machine, the children surround Changyu, some pulling his sleeves while others holding onto his legs, their voices chiming and chattering.																						
98	91		301								Urchins	Changyu! Changyu! Give us some snack money, please?																						
99	92		201							1	500216																							
100	93		301							1	Changyu	You monkeys!	1																					
101	94		301									Despite complaining, Changyu takes out a handful of grubs nonetheless.																						
102	95		301								Changyu	Scoot! Leave me alone!	1																					
103	96		301								Urchins	You're the best!																						
104	97		301									The urchins collect their bounty and scatter. And where they were, stands someone else leaning against the wall.																						
105	98		201							1	500227																							
106	99		301							1	Huainan	Didn't take you as someone charitable.	1																					
107	100		201							1	500216	1																						
108	101		301							1	Changyu	We're all literally on the same boat, trying to make ends meet. Not that it's my money anyway.	1

110	103		201							2	500227		-400

113	106		301							1	Changyu	Sigh, forget it...	1																					
114	107		301									Changyu gestures dramatically in disappointment.																						
115	108		204							1	1																							
116	109		301								Changyu	...Of course I got it!	1																					
117	110		301								Changyu	There's nothing I can't do if I set my mind to it! That guy immediately panicked when he saw me acting oh-so reluctant, and he swapped his money bag with my "horny" one during the fiasco.	1																					
118	111		301								Changyu	Real impressive switcheroo, I'll give him that... A shame he got outplayed. I wonder what his face looks like once he finds out the Receptor is fake.	1																					
119	997		204							1																								
120	112		301								Changyu	Well, you reap what you sow.	1																					
121	996		204							1	1																							
122	113		301								Changyu	By the way, you were fantastic! Even I got a little scared of the "Pulao Crew" chasing you!	1																					
123	114		301								Huainan	Stop exaggerating...	2																					
124	115		301									Perhaps discord does make concord. Changyu ran into Huainan a few more times since their first eventful encounter, and the two young men eventually became friends—and business partners.																						
125	116		301								Changyu	Let's roll! Full wallet means full bellies!	1																					
126	117		301									Huainan looks meek with Changyu's arm around him.																						
127	118		301								Huainan	Don't spend it all like you did last time—	2

130	960		401							1	201																							
131	119		301									The door to the gambling den suddenly bursts open, and two black-clad men drag and throw out a humanoid body. The injured figure gives a muffled grunt.																						
132	369		204							2	4																							
133	120		301									It is a Construct. Black liquid covers the Construct's face and hides the body's features. "It" groans, sporadically, as it extends its arm toward Changyu, seemingly desperate to grasp onto something.																						
134	970		204							1																								
135	121		301								Changyu	A Construct here of all places...	1																					
136	122		202							1	2				1																			
137	123		301								Damaged Construct	...																						
138	124		301									The Construct's hand drops. Its body lies still on the ground.																						
139	125		301									Changyu is no stranger to scenes like this. They are a common sight on the boat, and all he can do is look out for himself and nothing more. That is how one survives the Nighter.																						
140	126		301									Then he notices how tight Huainan is gripping his hand. Changyu can feel him shaking through his coat, struggling to stay composed.																						
141	127		201							1	500216		400																					
142	128		201							2	500227	4	-400																					
143	129		301							1	Changyu	You good?	1																					
144	130		301									The beggar nearby immediately adverts his gaze, pretending nothing has happened.																						
145	131		301								Huainan	...	2																					
146	132		301									Huainan takes a deep breath and lets go of Changyu, giving him a small nod.																						
147	133		301								Huainan	I'm good.	2																					
148	134		301								Changyu	...Is it the Construct?	1																					
149	135		301								Huainan	...Not our damn business, isn't it?	2																					
150	136		301								Changyu	They probably sold their bodies as merchandise to become Constructs. If that's what it takes for them to survive, then that's their choice, and that's how things go here. You... live with it.	1																					
151	137		301								Huainan	But... how? Have you ever considered that maybe people should just get to live? What if we weren't supposed to sell our souls only for a shot at life?!	2																					
152	138		204							1																								
153	139		301								Changyu	What's that all about? It's always a trade. Always.	1																					
154	140		301								Huainan	...Is that so. Maybe you're right.	2																					
155	141		301								Changyu	What you said is no way to survive on this boat!	1																					
156	142		301								Huainan	...Yeah, I was overthinking it. Let's go.	2																					
157	8525		301								Huainan	I've still got things to do after this.	2																					
158	143		301								Changyu	...Are you really alright?	1																					
159	144		301									They look into each other's eyes. Changyu scratches his head.																						
160	145		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Changyu	Let's go, then. What do you want to eat?	1

166	802		401						1000	2	1510																							
167	149		301									Out of nowhere comes a piercing scream, followed by frantic footsteps—gunshots—a heavy thud as something falls on the ground. Then everything is quiet again, save for the ravaging wind on the deck.																						
168	150		201							1	500148																							
169	151		301							1	Elderly Beggar	...So unfair.	1																					
170	152		301								Elderly Beggar	Probably runs out of gambling folks at this hour. Might as well call it a day.	1																					
171	153		301									The coughing beggar curls up in the freezing wind. He goes and packs up his belongings, only to find a pair of feet standing in front of him.																						
172	155		301								???	A question, old man.																						
173	156		201							1	500148																							
174	157		301							1	Elderly Beggar	You! Cough—What the hell are you doing here in the middle of the night?	1																					
175	158		301									Out of the shadow comes a young man crouching before the beggar.																						
176	159		201							1	500216																							
177	160		301							1	Changyu	Just wondering what's the deal with the Construct earlier. You heard anything about it?	1

180	163		301							1	Elderly Beggar	Oh... What's it to you?	2																					
181	164		301								Changyu	Just curious. C'mon, haven't I been treating you pretty well? Wanna give me the scoop?	1																					
182	165		301								Elderly Beggar	I don't mind telling you, but you better not get involved with that lot...	2																					
183	166		301								Changyu	I'm just being nosy. Folks like us, the worst thing we can face on this boat is uncertainty, don't you agree?	1																					
184	167		301								Elderly Beggar	Well... If you say so...	2																					
185	168		301									The beggar thinks for a moment.																						
186	169		301								Elderly Beggar	The "bad-wagon."	2																					
187	170		301								Changyu	"Bad-wagon"? You mean...	1																					
188	171		301								Elderly Beggar	Akdilek, the enterprise built on top of a train. They control the bulk of Earth's economy... For some reason, they have their eyes on us recently and bought a bunch of Constructs on the black market.	2																					
189	172		301									Changyu has heard of this "bad-wagon" in the past, but he never thought it would concern him someday.																						
190	173		301								Elderly Beggar	Word is they're experimenting on putting mechanoid brains into human bodies, even though swapping minds between different species is forbidden...	2																					
191	95122		301								Elderly Beggar	That, or they're buying the Constructs as toys for the Aristocrats... Now you know where the Construct bodies that they throw away every time we dock come from.	2																					
192	174		301								Elderly Beggar	And I hear that they're looking for humans suitable to be refitted into Constructs... Knowing what I know now, maybe you should keep an eye out.	2																					
193	810		204							1	5																							
194	175		301								Changyu	Is Akdilek why those merchants are attending the Trade Fair? But why the Nighter?	1																					
195	176		301								Elderly Beggar	Who knows? But no one's bothered to hide anything even when someone pokes around, if you know what I mean. Just don't do anything stupid.	2
