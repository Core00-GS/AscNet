5	5		302								I never knew a place like this existed in Babylonia.	6	How did you find out about this place, Lee?	6																				
6	6		301								Lee	It's a supply depot for ordering military-grade machine parts. It's off the beaten path, so only a few people know about it.	1																					
7	7		301								Lee	As for how I found this place...	1																					
8	8		301								Lee	Most machine parts in the workshop are uniformly rationed, but a few special parts need to go through an application process.	1																					
9	9		301								Lee	Parts are then sent anonymously to headquarters.	1																					
10	10		301								Lee	Even though there isn't an address listed on the orders, each order has a Diophantine equation and an irregular arc hidden on it.	1																					
11	11		301								Lee	After solving the equation, I got a set of coordinates.	1																					
12	12		301								Lee	I compared the curve with the terrain, then calculated Eden's trajectory to accurately pinpoint its location.	1																					
13	13		301								Lee	After that, I took some time while we were preparing for a mission to investigate the area, and I found it.	1																					
14	14		302								I have no idea what the heck you're saying, but it sounds impressive...	15	You're always quietly observing every little detail.	15

16	16		301								Lee	...Anyway, we should be able to find a core chip for the tiny robot here.	1																					
17	17		302								What kind of chip is it?	18

19	19		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lee	It's a special chip. There's no set ID code to identify it. Just stay here, and I'll go look for it.	1
