39	39		301									As I woke up from the deepest darkness, I saw a strange underground space.																						
40	40		301									Strange tubes extended in all directions connected to my body.																						
41	41		301									...My body?																						
42	42		301									I tried to move, but I was too weak.

47	47		301									Why is everyone so small? So far away?																						
48	48		301									I look at "myself" reflected in the glass.																						
49	50		301									I had become more detestable than any creature, more horrific than any nightmare... I was a monster, one that is completely inhuman.

54	54		301									The booming alarm made my head ache from the intense pain.																						
55	55		301									They want to... control me.

60	60		301									The response was almost built-in. It was as if I had a lust for blood.																						
61	61		301								Amberia	What am I... I'm a... weapon? No, NO!	1																					
62	62		301								Amberia	Why... Why are you doing this...	1																					
63	63		301									Still unable to feel anything, I broke free from my restraints and crawled towards the door in my mangled form.																						
64	64		301									In the hangar, the surrounding machinery began to bend to my will, as if under my control. They smashed the glass retaining them and attacked people as they attempted to flee.

67	67		301									The scream awakened a memory—numerous unfamiliar images and data poured into my mind...

69	69		301									Those who screamed in pain for the experiments were the same people who survived the riots in Soltavara. They were the ones rescued by the ARU, that included... Anfia.
