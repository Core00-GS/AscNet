4	4		301									These are all signs that the Construct under pursuit knows nothing about counter-tracking.																						
5	5		301									For someone to run in so flustered a fashion, they must, at the very least, be worth chasing.

19	21		301									The vital fluid footprints branch left and right curtly, but then eventually regroup. The regrouped trail tumbles toward the gate of the theme park in the distance.																						
20	22		301									You do not find any signs of a battle, or rather, this person seems completely incapable of fighting.

29	31		301									As imagined.																						
30	32		301									Looks like this Construct is not only completely oblivious to counter-tracking techniques, but is also heavily wounded.																						
31	33		301									Before prying any information out of his mouth, he will at least require emergency repairs.

37	39		301									He is restrained, but only so Liv can perform emergency treatment on him.																						
38	40		301									The Construct does not seem to be equipped with a functional Inver-Device. Even the frame design seems to be dated, harking back to the designs of Operation Acadia.																						
39	41		301									...Could this be Daedalus technology? But the Purifying Force is out on a mission right now, so it is impossible to confirm with Bianca.

46	48		301									Which is expected.																						
47	49		301									Seems like external help might be required to identify this person.																						
48	50		301									Since this Construct's frame screams Operation Acadia period from up to down, someone in Babylonia might know his background.																						
49	51		301									It is still a crapshoot, but it should not hurt to ask.

60	62		302								Doesn't seem like he can fight.	63																						
61	63		301								Asimov	You've piqued my curiosity. Is Liv doing emergency repairs on him?	1																					
62	64		302								Yes.	65																						
63	65		301								Asimov	I'll need Liv's Inver-Device for a short while to run a more comprehensive scan... Aaand, got it.	1

65	67		302								He's an Ascendant?	68																						
66	68		301								Asimov	That would have been a solid "yes" in the past, but after that Qu in Kowloong, I can't say for sure that he's the sort of Ascendant we know about.	1

77	79		302								Hidden function?	80																						
78	80		301								???	...Just kill me. The contents within will self-destruct when I die.	1

119	118		301								Roland	And the master need not explain to the guest their presence. 'Tis the other way round, the guests are the ones to explain their reason of visit.	1
