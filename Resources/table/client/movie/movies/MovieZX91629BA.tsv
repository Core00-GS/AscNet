33	33		301							1	Murray	Thank goodness! Finally got through...	1																					
34	34		301								Murray	Babylonia's positioning radar suddenly lost track of your singals about 20 minutes ago. I... Everyone was concerned.	1																					
35	35		301									Murray's face is marked with a troubled frown. His voice sounds glitchy, and his reaction is delayed due to the unsteady connection and signal blockade.																						
36	36		302								(Brief him on the situation)	37																						
37	37		301								Murray	I see...	1

40	40		201							1	500026																							
41	41		301							1	Lee	You must have looked into this site, Murray. Something must be blocking the signals on a large scale... We had to rely on the backup communication link.	1																					
42	42		301								Lee	To be honest, I'm surprised that we are able to connect in this circumstance.	1

45	45		301							1	Murray	According to the information Liv synced in the ruins, this is the site where Huaxu's key is held, correct?	1																					
46	46		301									Lee nods in agreement.																						
47	47		301								Murray	In that case, there is a strong likelihood that you will clash with the Ascendants.	1																					
48	48		301								Murray	I would've advised against diving straight in without adequate intel and a good connection. It would be difficult to call reinforcements in the event of an emergency.	1																					
49	49		302								But it's a matter of urgency.	50	I believe in Gray Raven.	56

51	51		201							1	500026																							
52	52		301							1	Lee	We created quite a stir when we arrived, which must have attracted the Ascendants' notice. Huaxu's coordinates from the last signal have shifted since the first one.	1																					
53	53		301								Lee	It took a long time for us to uncover this lead. We cannot afford to let them slip away.	1

66	66		301							1	Lee	I'll use it to trace our route and overlay the factory plan to form a topographic map, and sync it with you.	1																					
67	67		301								Lee	The backup comms has a limited amount of bandwidth. I'll send you a new topographic map every five minutes so you can monitor our route and the overall layout of this place.	1																					
68	68		301								Lee	As before, you can confirm the receipt of the message by sending me a feedback.	1
