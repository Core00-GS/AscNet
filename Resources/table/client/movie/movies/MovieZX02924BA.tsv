19	19		301							1	Lithos	You're the only one left, Gray Raven Commandant.	1																					
20	20		301								Lithos	The truth is I don't want to kill you. You're different from Ravenge. You're not... repulsive.	1																					
21	21		301								Lithos	I'm happy to bring you back if you want and turn you into a Construct as well. I can try to make you one of us. Our companion.	1																					
22	22		302								I'll pass.	23	Sounds good.	26																				
23	23		301								Lithos	Why?	1																					
24	24		301									Lithos slowly approaches you while paying attention to his surroundings. He does not seem hurried to take down his last target.																						
25	25		302								My actual companions need to connect to my Mind Beacon.	28																						
26	26		302								But I'd rather have Asimov do it.	27																						
27	27		302								Not to mention that my actual companions need to connect to my Mind Beacon.	28

29	29		301								Lithos	Can't I be one?	1

33	33		204							1	2																							
34	34		301								Lithos	I also want to find a way to coexist with humans, but I've failed to achieve anything except hurting more people...	1																					
35	35		302								You want to coexist with humans?	36																						
36	36		301								Lithos	I do. It must be hard for you to believe... but this is the one thing you can count on—	1																					
37	37		301								Lithos	I love this world, and I love most people in it. I desperately want them to outlive this apocalypse, even if it means they have to live on in a different, slightly less intact form...	1																					
38	38		301								Lithos	This does make me kind of an outlier among the Ascendants, you know?	1																					
39	39		302								...	40																						
40	40		301									You try to look for an exit again while he speaks. Unfortunately, you are on an open field right now. Without any covers, there is no way you can outrun a Construct, not to mention one with a strange mechanical chair.																						
41	41		301									It is not wise to confront an Ascendant alone. The best thing you can do right now is not to act rashly.																						
42	42		302								(Discreetly send another signal to Lucia)	43

44	44		301								Lithos	Ha... Does "Paper Crane" bother you?	1																					
45	45		204							1	1																							
46	46		301									Noticing your gaze, Lithos grins.																						
47	47		301								Lithos	This is the "torture chair" I use to torment or kill the people who sit on it. Well-behaved children should stay away from her.	1																					
48	48		301								Lithos	She was a mechanical wheelchair used to assist people with disability... but she has since transformed into this after my "fathers" remade her.	1																					
49	49		302								Your fathers?	50																						
50	50		204							1	2																							
51	51		301								Lithos	The people who raised me when I was young.	1																					
52	52		301								Lithos	You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you? That's okay. Simply put... she's just an infected mechanoid now.	1																					
53	53		301								Lithos	You don't have to understand her, and you don't have to know what happened between us. Just consider her as a Corrupted.	1																					
54	54		301								Lithos	After all, it doesn't matter what I say. You humans will always treat it as the weapon of an Ascendant.	1																					
55	55		302								...	56																						
56	56		301								Lithos	Do you regret coming here to investigate the deserters? These people wouldn't have been hurt if it weren't for you.	1																					
57	57		301								Lithos	The captain of the Purifying Force... Bianca, isn't it? Mister must have killed her by now.	1																					
58	58		302								I believe in her.	59																						
59	59		301								Lithos	...Believe?	1																					
60	60		301								Lithos	Are you going to keep resisting just because you believe things can change?	1																					
61	61		302								Of course.	62																						
62	62		301								Lithos	You're all the same, with so much confidence in your abilities... Can't you see how many of you are dying because of the Punishing Virus?	1																					
63	63		301								Lithos	You might think the filtering is cruel... but if you keep fighting like this, what's the difference between the filtering and a victory that no one survives?	1																					
64	64		301								Lithos	Ascendants are trying to save those with our gifts... Without us, even they are going to perish.	1																					
65	65		302								Without you, humanity would have won a long time ago.	66																						
66	66		302								We would have saved more people as well.	67																						
67	67		301								Lithos	...You can't save anybody.	1																					
68	68		301								Lithos	You can't control the Punishing Virus. Even the air is toxic to you now.	1																					
69	69		301								Lithos	The only way to survive this world is to pass the filtering.	1

71	71		301									The Punishing Virus around Lithos slowly forms into spikes that point at you.																						
72	72		301								Lithos	Humanity's courage and hope... are nothing but illusions. It's the flame that kills the moth.	1																					
73	73		301								Lithos	Before I crush that hope, Gray Raven Commandant, allow me to keep you with me. I will make sure to weave you a beautiful dream, even if you end up as fragments inside the Red Tide.	1

96	96		301								Lithos	...																						
97	97		301								Lithos	Is this your choice and your answer?																						
98	98		301								Noan	Yes. It doesn't matter how many times you ask. I'll never agree with you and the filtering.																						
99	99		301								Noan	I don't want to stay in a chasm of exiles and cages; I don't want to see their joyless smiles; I don't want to pity your crocodile tears!																						
100	100		301								Noan	I will not give up on my dream...!																						
101	101		301								Lithos	You can't save anyone without the power of an Ascendant. They will all die, just like your old comrades and companions did.																						
102	102		301								Noan	I know. But there are things I can do even as an ordinary person.																						
103	103		301								Lithos	Babylonia won't accept someone who has a connection with the Ascendants. They won't stop seeing you as a threat.																						
104	104		301								Noan	I know. Better be treated as a threat than keep making the same mistake.																						
105	105		301								Lithos	That's not the Eden you're looking for. They will exploit you and your desire to be a "hero" before discarding you or even accusing you of worse crimes you haven't committed.																						
106	106		301								Noan	I know. Been there, done that. I don't regret my choices.																						
107	107		301									Bella worriedly asked him three questions a few days before the battle on the train back then. Confused and stressed, all Noan could answer was "no idea."																						
108	108		301									But now, he knows he is not turning back, even if the path ahead is a grave laden with thorns!																						
109	109		301								Noan	My dream, that future we wanted, is right there beyond the seemingly infinite darkness.

281	281		301							1	Asimov	There are indeed some anomalies in his frame.	1																					
282	282		301								Asimov	But he wasn't controlling them, nor was he losing control. The Ascendant established a unique connection with him using the Punishing Virus.	1																					
283	283		301								Asimov	I believe the Ascendant left behind some special connection technology in his frame or his M.I.N.D. when the Ascendant turned him into a Construct.	1																					
284	284		301								Asimov	It's a fascinating design. It will certainly expand the possibilities for future Construct development.	1

288	288		301							1	Hassen	So you're saying that he isn't an Ascendant or a Transcendant?	2																					
289	289		301								Asimov	That's right. If I have to guess, the anomalies and his power only appeared because he was connected to and controlled by the Ascendant. He's just a normal Construct if he stays away from them.	1

292	292		301							1	Nikola	Quite fitting for the Ascendant they called "Swindler" back in the day. He was lying when he said the kid would "lose control if he leaves the Ascendants."	2																					
293	293		301								Asimov	I can't be sure if his frame or his M.I.N.D. have been affected by other factors because of that. Right now, I can't guarantee that he won't lose control again.	1																					
294	294		301								Nikola	It's probably safer to keep him in the lab for now.	2																					
295	295		301								Asimov	I don't recommend it. He has been nothing but corroborative. Locking him up any longer seems unnecessarily inhumane.	1																					
296	296		301								Nikola	Are you sure?	2																					
297	297		301								Asimov	He hasn't asked to change his frame, and every test and inspection was conducted as is.	1																					
298	298		301								Asimov	High-pressure tests often damage his parts, and the inspections require removing some components. Those aren't a walk in the park.	1																					
299	299		301								Asimov	He hasn't complained about anything. He would have shown it by now if he was incompliant.	1																					
300	300		301								Nikola	Do you have a way to prevent him from losing control?	2																					
301	301		301								Asimov	I do. I've left some "insurance policies" inside him after getting his permission.	1																					
302	302		301								Nikola	When can we be sure that the threat is completely gone?	2																					
303	303		301								Asimov	I'll need some time. The Ascendants are staying away from him currently. It will take longer to unravel its intricacies without a way to observe and collect samples.	1																					
304	304		301								Nikola	We'll get a sample if he comes into contact with an Ascendant again, won't we?	2																					
305	305		301								Nikola	Hmph. That sounds like something Kurono and their researchers would do. They won't let this go if they find out about him.	2																					
306	306		301								Asimov	He'll most likely die or defect if we do that. Before we solve this issue or replace his frame, I suggest keeping him away from missions that might involve the Ascendants.	1																					
307	307		301								Nikola	I guess I made the right choice assigning him to Dark Aries.	2
