30	30		301								Luna	Do you want to know why I became an Ascendant?	1																					
31	31		301								α	I do.	2																					
32	32		301								Luna	In the beginning, I just wanted to live.	1																					
33	33		301								Luna	But in order to see you again, in order to survive, something changed.	1																					
34	34		301								Luna	They only saw me as a threat that needed to be destroyed...	1																					
35	35		301								Luna	Once I was labeled a threat, it wasn't so easy to live. It came at a cost. Wasn't that the same for you, Sis?	1																					
36	36		301									Hearing this question, Alpha stares at the palm of her hand in disgust, then clenches her fist as if to crush something.																						
37	37		301									Lucia frequently makes this gesture, but she is far more gentle as if to hold onto something precious.																						
38	38		301								Luna	Do you want to go back?	1																					
39	39		301								α	I would still have some foolish hope had that never happened.	2

62	64		301									Time and war have ravaged this area, dealing irreparable damage to the land. However, a sense of familiarity still remains to give the three of them a sense of nostalgia.																						
63	65		301								Lucia	If this was where my suppressed memory took place...	1

74	76		301								Lucia	I'm really grateful to be with everyone.	1																					
75	77		301								Lucia	Even if this grateful feeling, according to the other me, comes from my ignorance of the truth.	1																					
76	78		301								Lucia	But now, no matter what I was born to do, I'm sure your conviction and tenderness would steer me once again in the right direction.	1																					
77	79		301								Lucia	...Yes, I'm sure of it.	1																					
78	80		301									She reaffirms herself quietly.																						
79	81		301								Lucia	Before the gap in my memory, I was a member of the previous Gray Raven team. That was before the three of you were a part of the Gray Ravens.	1																					
80	82		301								Lucia	Even without Luna by my side, I was still committed to fighting for Babylonia, for humans and my friends, just like I am now.	1																					
81	83		301								Lucia	But something happened during that gap in my memory, causing Alpha to walk down the path she's on.	1																					
82	84		301								Lucia	That's why... I can't give you my promise—I can't imagine what will happen after I remember.	1																					
83	85		302								But the Lucia I know doesn't like to run away.	86																						
84	86		301								Lucia	...Yes.	1																					
85	87		302								Also, I told you.	88																						
86	88		301								Lucia	Hm?	1
