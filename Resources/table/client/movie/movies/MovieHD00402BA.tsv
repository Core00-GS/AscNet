10	10		301								Lucia	They were last seen in the western base of the Gangdise Mountains—a place called the Jijing Monastery.	1																					
11	11		301								Lucia	During this time, there was a massive outbreak of the Punishing Virus throughout the area. Reports claim that it is highly concentrated.	1

23	23		301								Lucia	What's going on?																						
24	24		301								Lee	Don't panic. Let me check the radar data first. It could just be a false alarm... wait...																						
25	25		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	What is it?

27	27		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Lee	The radar shows that a barrage of long-ranged projectiles has locked onto us. They appear to be interstellar cruise missiles...																						
28	28		301								Liv	I've also got a reading on Punishing Virus reaction!																						
29	29		301								Lucia	The Punishing Virus... low Earth missile attacks... Must be the space station!																						
30	30		301								Lee	No, the space station isn't capable of attacking us while we're in low Earth orbit...																						
31	31		301								Lee	We're flying through a minefield—the remains of warships infected by the Punishing Virus are activating as we pass.																						
32	32		301								Lee	Normally, they should only lock onto transport-class airships...																						
33	33		301								Lee	Dammit... I chose to go the long way to stay out of danger, but I got us stuck in low Earth orbit for too long...																						
34	34		301									—!																						
35	35		301								Liv	...The cruise missiles are getting closer!																						
36	36		301								Lucia	Can we shake them off our tail?																						
37	37		301								Lee	It's too late. With our entry speed into the stratosphere, we can't outrun the missiles.																						
38	38		301								Lee	Even in the most optimistic scenario, the missiles will hit us in thirty seconds...																						
39	39		301								Lee	I got this. Activating manual flight control.																						
40	40		301								Liv	ETA... Twenty seconds!																						
41	41		301								Lee	Done...! Commandant I need to maintain operational procedures. Take the wheel.																						
42	42		302								Leave it to me.	43																						
43	43		301									BOOM—!																						
44	44		301									A missile explodes near the airdrop jet, throwing you into disarray.

59	59		301								Lucia	Have we regained control?																						
60	60		301								Lee	We have. I'm guessing our commandant graduated at the top of the class.																						
61	61		301								Liv	More... missiles... approaching fast!																						
62	62		301								Lee	Our airdrop jet should be a bit more agile, comparatively speaking... Let's change direction to widen the gap first.																						
63	63		302								Make it so.	64																						
64	64		301								Lee	Wait, what?! They're approaching from the other side too?																						
65	65		301								Liv	ETA... Fifteen seconds!																						
66	66		301								Lee	Brace for impact...
