4	4		301									Huainan is right there on the other side—his hair is a mess, his sunken eyes showing no emotions. Changyu has never seen him like this, as if a deadly blizzard is brewing under his skin, ready to be unleashed.																						
5	5		301									They stand opposite each other, eyes locked. A shiver goes down Changyu's spine.

8	8		301							1	Huainan	As you can see, I lied.	2																					
9	9		301								Changyu	Why is that?	1																					
10	10		301									"Were you worried for my safety? Or were you using me to get inside because you failed the test for Tantalum-193 affinity?"																						
11	11		301								Huainan	Not that I'm obligated to tell you this—	2																					
12	12		301								Huainan	To qualify as merchandise, I need to take advantage of who you are.	2																					
13	13		301								Changyu	...Who I am?	1																					
14	14		204							2																								
15	15		301								Huainan	Your suitability is what I've been after since the very beginning. That tycoon was just an actor I hired to get close to you.	2																					
16	100		301								Huainan	It took a while, I admit, getting close to you. But you've been so damn accommodating every step of the way, so at least it was effort well spent.	2																					
17	16		301								Changyu	...Why me?	1																					
18	17		301								Huainan	Don't flatter yourself. You're just one of a very long list of names.	2																					
19	18		204							2	4																							
20	19		301								Huainan	I've made so many plans, all for a shot to get what I want. You and Akdilek are both a means to an end.	2																					
21	20		301								Huainan	Akdilek is a buyer I contacted quite a while ago. They needed suitable bodies, so I needed tools to fabricate my qualification.	2																					
22	120		301								Huainan	That also took a while. So much energy wasted on names after names, looking for someone that fits the bill. And so much time spent spreading rumors of Akdilek's evildoing...	2																					
23	21		204							2																								
24	22		301								Huainan	Which is funny, by the way. You won't believe how easy it is to sway the public's opinions.	2																					
25	23		301								Huainan	All it took was a few made-up stories told at the right time. People are always more willing to believe in weird bullshit than stone-cold facts.	2																					
26	24		301								Changyu	But that Construct we saw—	1																					
27	25		301								Huainan	You're so gullible sometimes. You thought you knew the beggar? Do you want to know how few grubs it took me to have him put on a show for you?	2																					
28	26		301								Changyu	So Akdilek never wronged you...	1																					
29	27		301								Huainan	You were quite insistent, so I had to make something up to quench your curiosity.	2																					
30	28		301								Huainan	Credit where it's due. What you said about following the "ebb and flow of the plot" was really inspiring. I wouldn't have gotten as far as I have without pushing you down the drain and watching you flow.	2																					
31	29		301									Now it all makes sense: the times Huainan got unexpectedly quiet, the weird questions he would sometimes ask, the days he was unaccounted for...																						
32	30		301									Changyu is shaking.																						
33	31		301								Changyu	Why... Why are you trying to be Akdilek's merchandise?	1																					
34	32		204							2	4																							
35	33		301								Huainan	Merchandise gets to leave this boat—to finally leave this abomination behind...	2																					
36	34		301								Changyu	...You want to leave the Nighter.	1																					
37	35		204							2																								
38	36		301								Huainan	You always knew that, didn't you?	2																					
39	37		301								Changyu	You won't survive out there without the boat's resources and filters! The world outside is filled with Corrupted!	1																					
40	38		204							2	5																							
41	39		301								Huainan	Then how have the visiting merchants survived?!	2																					
42	40		301								Huainan	Are Corrupted even real? Have you seen one with your own eyes? What if they're also just ideas planted in our heads by those collars? How can you tell what is real and what is a goddamn dream?!	2																					
43	41		301								Changyu	I-I don't know—I have seen them, I—I can't remember...	1																					
44	101		502							PanelActor1Shake																								
45	42		301								Changyu	Argh! My head—it hurts—	1																					
46	43		204							2	4																							
47	44		301								Huainan	You know?	2																					
48	45		301								Huainan	One night I suddenly realized I couldn't recall my past at all. Once that doubt seeped in, I couldn't get rid of this... pain.	2																					
49	46		301								Huainan	I should be the one asking why.	2																					
50	47		301								Huainan	To live like a machine following its program day after day after day for all the years to come, barely a shell of yourself—	2																					
51	48		301								Huainan	Why?! Why would you accept that fate?!	2																					
52	49		301								Changyu	No... It's not like that...	1																					
53	50		301								Huainan	The collars might not control how we think or act, but they for sure make a fool out of all of us! If they tell us to dive, we make sure we drown ourselves and drag someone down with us!	2																					
54	51		301								Huainan	Even your ridiculous, self-righteous justice...	2																					
55	52		204							1																								
56	53		301								Changyu	I...	1																					
57	54		301								Huainan	Every goddamn thing on this boat knows this. Even you, and you just accept it—is that not funny to you?	2																					
58	55		301								Huainan	None of you bothers to imagine something more, to see through their lies, because they are so damn safe and comfortable.	2																					
59	56		301								Huainan	And more of you... You praise it. You praise this ridiculous butterfly dream weaved by Huaxu because you're so damn used to it.	2																					
60	57		301								Huainan	You disgust me. "Huaxu", or whatever that authoritative piece of shit calls itself, and the docile pigs that willingly praise and grovel to it... You all disgust me.	2																					
61	58		301								Huainan	I will not stand living my life on a leash, based on some "hope" that one day this boat may dock on habitable land.	2																					
62	59		204							2	5																							
63	60		301								Huainan	I'm getting rid of this damn monster—I'm going to the real world—I'll find out who I am—I will be free.	2																					
64	61		301								Changyu	Huainan... I-I've never thought of it like that, but I—	1																					
65	62		204							2	4																							
66	63		301								Huainan	You're just like them.	2																					
67	64		204							1	16																							
68	65		301								Changyu	That's not true!	1																					
69	66		301								Changyu	I've listened to everything you've said! I-I remember every word, and I've never stopped thinking—	1																					
70	67		204							2	5																							
71	68		301								Huainan	Enough! What does it matter, if you're just gonna end up like the rest of those fools? So turn your back on me already, and carry on with that damn dream of yours!	2																					
72	69		204							2	4																							
73	70		301								Changyu	You could have told me!	1																					
74	71		301								Changyu	If you would've just told me that you feel stuck here and you wanna go home—	1																					
75	72		301								Huainan	You thrive here, Changyu. You're happy here. So dream your homecoming dream, or deliver your self-righteous justice if it fulfills you. I wasn't going to take that away from you.	2																					
76	73		301								Huainan	Head back, and pretend nothing's happened. I'm only another damn thing that got traded away on this boat, someone you briefly met... Someone who brought you a few decent memories.	2																					
77	74		301								Changyu	How can I pretend nothing has happened after everything we've been through?!	1																					
78	75		301								Huainan	You made your choice when I offered you reality away from this dream!	2																					
79	76		301								Changyu	Bullshit!	1																					
80	77		301								Changyu	You've never thought to trust me! Because you've never seen me as anyone other than one of them—	1																					
81	78		301								Changyu	Do you think I've never had my doubts about you?	1																					
82	79		301								Changyu	"The worst thing we can face on this boat is uncertainty..." Isn't that right?	1																					
83	80		301								Changyu	I never told you that.	1																					
84	81		301								Huainan	Changyu... You're so goddamn naive.	2																					
85	82		301								Changyu	Would you have told me everything if I chose the truth then?	1																					
86	130		301								Huainan	...Does it matter anymore?	2																					
87	83		301								Huainan	All you need to know is... you would've lived if you'd chosen the truth.	2																					
88	84		301								Huainan	But you've decided to stay in your dream, so let me make sure you don't wake up. I will not allow you to expose what I've done.	2																					
89	85		301									Huainan raises his weapon. The blade glistens in the wind.																						
90	86		204							2	5																							
91	87		301								Huainan	Don't be so damn trusting. That's what you said.	2																					
92	88		204							1	5																							
93	89		301								Changyu	Huainan... You don't deserve my trust!	1																					
94	90		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Changyu	If this is what you want, then so be it.	1
