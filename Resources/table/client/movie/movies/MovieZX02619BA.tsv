4	4		301									Awake from the absurd dream, Nanami is still drifting in space.																						
5	5		301									She hears a voice among the stars, speaking a language different from any human language she is aware of. Her ears have captured the sound and somehow understood it.																						
6	6		301								Nanami	...Who is that?																						
7	7		301								"Universe"	We heard your voice in the center of "universe."																						
8	8		301								"Universe"	But you still seem to have some "confusion."																						
9	9		301								Nanami	Confusion... Right. Nanami... is beginning to not understand why I'm doing this.																						
10	10		301								"Universe"	Thinking is a sign of evolution.																						
11	11		301								Nanami	Are you saying that Nanami has evolved?																						
12	12		301								"Universe"	You think, therefore you are. Everything here is the realization of your thoughts. We can show you everything you have ever thought about, as well as everything you seek but cannot witness.																						
13	13		301									Still confused, Nanami manages to grasp the key information in the conversation.																						
14	14		301								Nanami	Where is the future where humans and machines live happily with each other?																						
15	15		301								"Universe"	Everything you and humankind feel, know, and come in contact with on Earth exists three-dimensionally.																						
16	16		301								"Universe"	To lives of higher dimensions, time becomes another form—more like a physical object.																						
17	17		301								"Universe"	"Your past, present and future are but different pages on a book."

26	26		301									The simulation only exists in Gestalt's data space and has no impact on things happened in the past, or are happening right now.																						
27	27		301									While Nanami is venturing in the data space... Lots of things have happened on Earth, more or less under the influence of Nanami's action after she returns from the simulations.																						
28	28		301								Nanami	It's been so long already?	1

46	46		301									In a F.O.S. uniform, a much younger Commandant stares into the starry sky by a French window in Eden.																						
47	47		301								Nanami	【kuroname】... 【kuroname】!																						
48	48		301								【kuroname】.	...Huh? Who's talking to me?																						
49	49		301								Nanami	I am...																						
50	50		301									Nanami realizes that this Commandant doesn't recognize her.																						
51	51		301								Nanami	I'm the star that you are looking at.																						
52	52		301								【kuroname】.	Can stars talk too?																						
53	53		301								Nanami	We can! But I'm very, very far away... So my voice is hardly heard by anyone!																						
54	54		301								【kuroname】.	How far are you?																						
55	55		301								Nanami	Very... At the border of the universe, probably.																						
56	56		301									Nanami was about to say something else when a classmate pats Commandant on the shoulder.																						
57	57		301								Classmate	What are you doing? Spacing out?																						
58	58		301								【kuroname】.	I think I've heard a star talking...																						
59	59		301									Nanami chuckles. She just loves pulling pranks on Commandant, even at a time like this. She feels warm recounting all these familiar moments.

66	66		301									I have grasped something, Nanami thinks.																						
67	67		301									...A machine is designed, manufactured, and born into this world with a mission. That mission is coded and inscribed in the machine's logic program—and that's all that matters to the machine.																						
68	68		301									But unlike machines, or any other tool in the world, humans never carry any purpose since their birth.																						
69	69		301									No human is given any particular duty or purpose. They only come to the planet as creatures. In other words, humans are abandoned since birth.																						
70	70		301									With their primitive instincts, however, humankind learned to walk the Earth, conquered things, created things, and eventually reached a point where they were able to assign missions to that which they had created.																						
71	71		301									They can become anything they want to be, do anything they want, love anyone they love.																						
72	72		301									They can become a soldier, an opera singer, or a comic artist.																						
73	73		301									Love is what gives humankind unlimited potential. Even with its infinite computing power, the most sophisticated of supercomputers can't even get to the bottom of human potential.																						
74	74		301									When Commandant leaves, Nanami's surroundings once again assume the scene of the universe.

110	110		301							1	Nanami	Because I will find it myself.	1																					
111	111		301									There is light in her eyes, as if she can really see a future where humans have prevailed. No matter what, she believes in it. She believes they are actually living that future. That they are the universe where the cat lives.
