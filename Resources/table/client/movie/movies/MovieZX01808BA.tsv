3	3		301			DialogEnable						Before Ray began to understand the world around him, he had already forgotten his mother's face.																						
4	4		301									From very early on, he was raised by his father and grandma.																						
5	5		301									His grandma has always lived in the shadow of hatred.																						
6	6		301									She says that the Punishing Virus has taken everything from her.																						
7	7		301									How did it exactly?																						
8	8		301									Ever since he was born into this world and opened his eyes for the first time—he did not know.																						
9	9		301									The world was already like this.																						
10	10		301									But everyone always tells him that the world should not be like this.																						
11	11		301									That machines should not attack humans. That those towering builds used to be our homes.																						
12	12		301									Mankind had spread to every corner of the Earth, conquered the highest mountain and reached the deepest trench.																						
13	13		301									We were just shy of leaving this planet and spreading our footprints across the cosmos.																						
14	14		301									We should not be like rats subsisting in the dark corners of an apocalyptic world.																						
15	15		301									However, he had never seen that bygone era. All that remains in his hands are the vestiges of the past.																						
16	16		301									Perhaps, not even that.																						
17	17		301									Should he be filled with hate? Toward whom?																						
18	18		301									People do not blame landslides, earthquakes, tsunamis, and the cruelty of nature.																						
19	19		301									When something has become a part of this world, it is no different from natural disasters. The Punishing Virus is no different.																						
20	20		301									Ray has only seen this world, so he has naturally accepted all of its cruelty.																						
21	21		301									Deep within his memory, he sees the blurry image of a woman hugging him and humming an unknown song.																						
22	22		301									—A lullaby.																						
23	23		301									At least that's what the people of the Golden Age called it.																						
24	24		301									The lyrics have been lost to time. All that remains is the melody.																						
25	25		301									It's like a gentle stream of warm and tender feelings.																						
26	26		301									That's the last sound left by his mother.

150	147		301								Hans	I would not call it a betrayal. If sacrificing myself would lead to victory, I'd gladly die on the battlefield.	2																					
151	148		301								Lucia	Exactly. Every soldier in Babylonia is willing to sacrifice their life for a distant victory.	1

162	159		301								Lucia	"The World Government Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act" should only apply to civilians of the World Government. In doing so, you regard them as comrades. Do you not?	1

171	168		301								Hans	The laws of war are complex yet simple: all factors can be quantified into the addition and subtraction of effective strength. The first party to have their effective strength reduced to zero will be declared the loser.	2																					
172	169		301								Hans	We can think about feelings, but war will not, and neither will the Punishing Virus.	2																					
173	170		301								Hans	In our war against the virus, the only thing we can do is try our best to preserve our effective strength.	2
