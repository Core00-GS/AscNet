22	22		301								Ayla	You've gotta be a genius!																						
23	23		301								Ayla	I really, really, LOVE the story!																						
24	24		301								Ayla	Why don't you write it down? Just like how you adapted The Tempest, you can turn it into a play on stage.																						
25	25		301								Ayla	I'm sure your original script will be one of the greatest. I can't wait to see it!																						
26	26		301									Her heart is pounding, excited and exhilarated for the possibilities the future holds.																						
27	27		301								Selena	I think this story still has a lot of room for improvement...																						
28	28		301									Selena clenches her fists without anyone else noticing.																						
29	29		301									It is a world pieced together by fragments of fantasies.																						
30	30		301									She knows only a little about storywriting. And she isn't that experienced in this trade either. If she was to go freestyle right now, she would tell this fantasy story like singing a poem...																						
31	31		301									Selena doesn't feel at ease at all.																						
32	32		301								Ayla	But I really enjoyed your stories.																						
33	33		301								Ayla	They are beautiful.																						
34	34		301								Ayla	They are all so beautiful that when you told me those stories, I could see the story happening in my mind. I am going to draw those scenes right now!																						
35	35		301								Selena	But...																						
36	36		301									Selena hesitates. What is it that she wants to say?																						
37	37		301									Is the storyline too dull? Is her idea too naive or impractical? Or, is it that she was too obsessed with the romance and beauty that she couldn't control herself but put in too many fragments of thoughts and failed to make the sentences rhetorical enough?																						
38	38		301									She has always known her own shortcomings.																						
39	39		301									The words that were to come out of her mouth get intercepted halfway as Ayla reaches out to take Selena into her arms. Selena did not see this coming at all.																						
40	40		301								Ayla	...That's why I think your work is very impressive, Selena.																						
41	41		301									Her body is warm to the touch. And her heartbeats are strong.																						
42	42		301								Ayla	...Will you let me design the stage and settings for this play?																						
43	43		301									Her pink eyes show the purest, most sincere colors.																						
44	44		301								Selena	...Yes.																						
45	45		301								Selena	Thank you, Ayla.																						
46	46		301									Her mind is racing.																						
47	47		301									Yes, this is a naive fantasy. Yes, it is a mess. And yes, her story is unsophisticated and lacking flavor.																						
48	48		301									But everything has to start somewhere.																						
49	49		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She wants to write it down. She wants to give it a try.

53	53		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Before going out on the space station mission, Selena talked to Allen, the Chairman of the WGAA.																						
54	54		201							1	500111																							
55	55		301							1	Allen	Your opera once took Babylonia by storm and the WGAA thought highly of your career. There was no doubt you had real talent and skills.	1																					
56	56		301								Allen	You come from a wealthy family, and your future was incredibly bright. There was nothing compelling you to become a Construct.	1																					
57	57		301								Allen	So why did you become a Construct and join the Archaeological Team?	1																					
58	58		301								Allen	Don't get me wrong, members of the Archaeological Team can continue to engage in their previous pursuits. It's just that there are archaeological tasks to be performed regularly and so the amount of time you can spend on operas is much less than before.	1																					
59	59		301								Allen	I doubt you've given up the opera... You're not the fickle sort.	1																					
60	60		202							1					1																			
61	61		301									She ponders for a while but decides not to answer the question. Instead, she changes the subject.																						
62	62		301									She starts talking about an original opera with Allen.																						
63	63		301									It isn't "The Acadia Evacuation", which is based on real events. Instead, it is a nameless fantasy story, its ending unknown and its arc incomplete.																						
64	64		301									It is Selena's first-ever original work since she started her career as a writer, but compared to "The Acadia Evacuation", it is only a half-finished work that is much shorter and less popular. It counts as practice at best.																						
65	65		301									After "The Acadia Evacuation" became successful, the theater owners and publishers flocked to her, hoping Selena would let them play or publish her work.																						
66	66		301									But Selena said that, other than "The Acadia Evacuation", the only work she had was an incomplete story she wrote when she was still inexperienced. To her surprise, the want-to-be partners didn't lose interest in her upon learning this.																						
67	67		301									Some people told her how valuable a writer's early books could be, some offered to publish that story, and some were amazed by the brilliant ideas behind her story and even wanted to read it whether it could be published or not.																						
68	68		301									Selena turned them all down.																						
69	69		201							1	500111																							
70	70		301							1	Allen	Were you distressed by the recognition and attention that your work brought to you?	1

80	80		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The soldier's words lash her and judge her.																						
81	81		301									She was arrogant for portraying an era with which she was completely unfamiliar and taking the liberty to speculate how the people were struggling and feeling in that world. She had described a war filled with pain and sorrow as a story that was magnificent and glorious.																						
82	82		301									How foolish that was. Shame, confusion, anxiety, and many other mixed feelings haunted her like ghosts, forcing her to face the crimes she had committed and blaming her for the awful plays.																						
83	83		301									She could not be forgiven. She could not forgive herself.																						
84	84		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She was not going anywhere. Her work was not going anywhere.

90	90		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Words that come out of the tip of her pen are throwing questions and doubts at her.																						
91	91		301									Is the story realistic enough? Is it accurate enough? Or, is it all just her imagination and speculation?																						
92	92		301									How can she describe reality? Has she strayed away from the truth all along?																						
93	93		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Selena turns around.																						
94	94		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory40.jpg

96	96		201							1	500282	4																						
97	97		301							1	Selena	I returned to the virtual exhibition center, where I first used my little robot to act out The Tempest.	1																					
98	98		202							1					1																			
99	99		301									The exhibition center had had its technologies renewed. It even had a new manager to look after things.																						
100	100		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The holographic games centered around war are as popular as always. The more casual sections were replaced with exhibition stalls of that theme.																						
101	101		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory58.jpg																								
102	102		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						That day, when Selena returned home, she made a choice.																						
103	103		201							1	500282	4																						
104	104		301							1	Selena	I sent an email to the new manager and requested to set up a stall for virtual plays.	1																					
105	105		202							1					1																			
106	106		301									She didn't send the email as Selena, the famous playwright of Babylonia. Instead, she put an anonymous signature.																						
107	107		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Just like back when she was a young, inexperienced writer with no reputation or resource but a heartful of passion, she nervously waited for a chance to make herself seen.																						
108	108		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory59.jpg																								
109	109		301			AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin					But Selena's email was like a rock that sank to the bottom of the sea and caused no ripples.																						
110	110		301			AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin					She waited three more days and decided to send another email. This time, she attached her work and pleaded to tell the recipient about her dream and plan for the exhibition.																						
111	111		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory58.jpg																								
112	112		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Two days later, she finally received a reply. The manager refused her request and didn't even tell her why.																						
113	113		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					After some hesitation and thought, she decided to have a talk with the manager face-to-face to plead once again.																						
114	114		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory40.jpg																								
115	115		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Selena filed a request to the exhibition center's online system and asked to meet the new manager. She arrived early at the meeting room, but the manager never came until the center was almost about to close.																						
116	116		201							1	500282	4																						
117	117		301							1	Selena	The manager didn't recognize me. That... calmed me somehow.	1																					
118	118		202							1					1																			
119	119		301									The manager was impatient with Selena's persistence. He took the documents and files, which Selena carefully put together, only to take a quick glance at them.																						
120	120		301								Exhibition Manager	Every stall in this exhibition center displays only the most valuable works. I don't know where you got the idea that you could request a stall for free, but... we simply cannot spare any stall for your work, not even the stalls in the corner.																						
121	121		301									The manager accented on the word "free."																						
122	122		301									Selena immediately said she would be willing to rent a stall and sign an insurance contract in case the stall was damaged in any way.																						
123	123		301									But the manager didn't take the offer.																						
124	124		301									Instead, he waved his hand, turned around, and turned on his communication device.																						
125	125		301									Selena kept a polite distance and waited patiently.																						
126	126		301									Selena was persistent and not about to give up anytime soon. The manager realized she would not let him be if they didn't draw a conclusion to this discussion.																						
127	127		301									So, he turned off his communication device and took a deep breath as if he was making a big decision.																						
128	128		301								Exhibition Manager	I cannot give you a stall of your own. You said your story is about a champion and an evil dragon, right? That theme is a cliche, but...																						
129	129		301								Exhibition Manager	...At least it involves fighting. You have one day to use the exhibition stall. And you can pick one of our partners' gaming samples to create a package, so that you can show your play during the in-game loading screen.																						
130	130		301									Her heart was racing. After the manager left and she could no longer hear his footsteps, she placed her hand on her heart and crouched slowly.																						
131	131		301									Her mixed feelings were overwhelming. She was incredibly excited and exhilarated, even more so than she was right before "The Acadia Evacuation" debuted. She could hear her veins pulsing and her heart pounding.																						
132	132		301									It was probably because her blood was coursing faster, which gave more pressure to the blood veins. She felt a bit sad somehow. The suffocating feeling came rushing in just as quickly as it vanished. She breathed gently.																						
133	133		201							1	500282	4																						
134	134		301							1	Selena	I realized back then how lucky I was to build that makeshift stage and make the play happen.	1																					
135	135		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					I was also lucky to meet audiences that knew to appreciate the play and like-minded friends.																						
136	136		202							1					1																			
137	137		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory58.jpg																								
138	138		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After that, it was a stressful preparation.																						
139	139		301									Selena didn't tell anyone about this and didn't share her feelings and thoughts with anyone either.																						
140	140		301									It was a 1-on-1 duel between her and herself only. She wouldn't let anyone help. Selena prepared alone and made sure to follow the guidelines given by the manager: breaking down the story, replacing unnecessary parts with interactive gaming content... She worked hard to mix the play with games.																						
141	141		301									"Mix" might not be the most accurate word for it, but the partner's gaming sample is centered around combat and doesn't really leave any room for storytelling.																						
142	142		301									If she forced her stories into the game, it would be too awkward and out of place. The players who came to enjoy the combat would likely lose their patience. But if she omitted too many parts of the story, the play would be confusing to the audience who had an interest in exploring the story.																						
143	143		301									Facing all these challenges, she wasn't planning to back down. She had something to show in its most original form. This was her only chance.																						
144	144		301									Introduction, connection, transition, and ending. The most important part was to bring an immersive experience to the audience and prevent them from distracting them.																						
145	145		301									An idea came to Selena's mind. What if she used the windows between battles to bring everyone a vintage, calming fantasia in the form of recitative?																						
146	146		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					That would fill the blank in this gaming sample with colors and hopefully make everything lively.																						
147	147		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory40.jpg																								
148	148		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Then, on the exhibition day, she sent the software to the manager and arrived at the center early, waiting.																						
149	149		301									The staff started to get things ready in the exhibition center. This was the first time they demonstrated gaming samples. There were comment systems set up next to the exhibition stalls, so that the audience could leave their comments after experiencing something.																						
150	150		301									The moment the exhibition machine lit up, Selena felt like her heart was going to burst.																						
151	151		201							1	500111																							
152	152		301							1	Allen	You are very good at designing plays. I'm sure people liked your innovative work at that exhibition.	1																					
153	153		202							1					1																			
154	154		301									Selena gives a very faint smile and shakes her head.																						
155	155		301									It didn't end well at all.																						
156	156		301									The combat was all about real-time experience. It was nothing like stories, which would take time to read. No one was patient enough to bear with the storytelling part.																						
157	157		301									The two things just weren't meant to be presented together.																						
158	158		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Most people didn't want to visit her stall. And for those who did, they got distracted by the other cooler, more awesome games pretty quickly.																						
159	159		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
160	160		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						"This is tedious."																						
161	161		301									"What was that music in the beginning? That was annoying."																						
162	162		301									"This is a failure."																						
163	163		301									"This is a waste of time."																						
164	164		301									"I like the thrilling combat, but what's the storytelling about?"																						
165	165		301									"Boring."																						
166	166		301									"I can see the designer put a lot of effort into it... but this is wrong."																						
167	167		301									"What is this? I'm confused."																						
168	168		301									"What is the singing part supposed to be? Touching?"																						
169	169		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					"I can see that this is storytelling, but it is so out of place. I was hoping for a more immersive feeling."																						
170	170		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory40.jpg																								
171	171		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						...																						
172	172		301									Someone kicked the robot.																						
173	173		301									This is obsolete.																						
174	174		301									This is wrong.																						
175	175		301									This is a joke.																						
176	176		301									The romance isn't romantic enough. And the tragedy isn't tragic enough.																						
177	177		301									This isn't worth my time.																						
178	178		201							1	500282	4																						
179	179		301							1	Selena	Those were the comments I received.	1

181	181		202							1					1																			
182	182		301									It was like the sting of a needle.																						
183	183		301									Selena is stone-faced when she says it.																						
184	184		301									Sure, the audience was critical, but they were not just haters. The comments were genuine and honest.																						
185	185		301									So, after the exhibition was over, she asked the manager to get the data of the exhibition comment system. She collected the comments the audience left and reviewed every single one of them.																						
186	186		301									They were the genuine comments she was hoping for. It was hard but also the way it was meant to be.																						
187	187		301									Selena knew she had to look at things from an unbiased perspective. That was how she could really understand how the audience felt about her work and improve it accordingly.																						
188	188		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She knew no matter how critical the comments were, they should be respected and valued. The comments were the truth she had always wanted to know.

194	194		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
195	195		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						She has always known her own shortcomings.																						
196	196		301									Has her arrogance ruined another one of her works?																						
197	197		301									Is she going too far weaving every romantic fantasy with such care and polishing every phrase so tirelessly?																						
198	198		301									In this battle within herself, she has lost all judgment.																						
199	199		301									The audience tried to guide her, but eventually, no one was there to point her in the right direction.																						
200	200		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Her verdict has been announced. But the thing she thought would be the evidence judges her once more.

204	204		301									The character she controls dies countless times because of her poor mechanical skills.																						
205	205		301									But the champion doesn't choke on their blood. Instead, they fight to their last breath.																						
206	206		301									The melodies and tones turn into noisy, annoying music that echoes non-stop.																						
207	207		301									A question comes to her mind.																						
208	208		301									Had what happened in the exhibition center happened when she first started her career, would everything still be the same?																						
209	209		301									Hadn't she met Ayla and gotten inspired, would she continue to write more plays?																						
210	210		301									She ponders the question for a very long time.																						
211	211		301									There is no answer.																						
212	212		301									At that moment, she cannot find an absolute, clear answer.																						
213	213		301									Selena imports the data of her draft into Hamlet. She hasn't made any changes to it, but she has added some new endings.

227	227		301								Selena	The final touch for the new frame's M.I.N.D. adaptation is also done.	1

230	230		301									Ayla insisted on developing the new frame earlier and acted as the lead designer for its appearance.																						
231	231		301									She proposed many ideas, which were accepted and optimized.																						
232	232		301									In the space of M.I.N.D., Selena is looking at herself.																						
233	233		301									The frame she is using right now is suitable for an archaeological mission with a standard appearance.																						
234	234		301									The appearance of this new frame is more like a dress one would wear to a ball or a banquet. The entire set looks particularly fancy.

242	242		204							1																								
243	243		301								Selena	Many people, including myself in the past, thought I never doubted my own talents. They thought I had absolute confidence in myself.	1																					
244	244		202							1					1																			
245	245		301									Even when she is lost, she still makes decisions and takes action.																						
246	246		301									She wants to try it and prove it. She wants a chance at redemption. And she is constantly moving forward.																						
247	247		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The moment her new frame is configured, in the illusory space of M.I.N.D., Selena sees the beast in herself clearly as if looking in a mirror.

250	250		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		Is that the way she liked herself best?																						
251	251		301									It was as exquisite, delicate, innocent, and beautiful as the delightful music in a fantasy.																						
252	252		301									She was arrogant and a lucky person who lived in Eden. She had delusional dreams. Her sins. The beast within her.																						
253	253		301									But she never looked away from the fire that burned within her. She would bear all these burdens on her journey.

257	257		301							1	Selena	I knew all too well the fantasy was an incomplete play.	1																					
258	258		301								Selena	But it still had some merits.	1																					
259	259		202							1					1																			
260	260		301									Her arrogance doesn't come from her presumptuous attempt to portray reality.																						
261	261		301									She reflects on her naivety.																						
262	262		301									But she cannot blame it on her very first work.																						
263	263		301									She cannot blame it on herself in the past.																						
264	264		301									This is because she understands it better than anyone else that herself in the past tried to portray a fantasy world using her utmost genuine feelings.																						
265	265		301									Her arrogance is part of the reality.																						
266	266		301									Her naivety is part of the reality.																						
267	267		301									Treating naivety as a mistake and erasing it, refusing to admit her very first work, and refusing to accept who she once was, those are the real arrogance.																						
268	268		301									If her arrogance is a ferocious wolf, a lion, a leopard, a beast within her, and the sins she cannot leave behind, it is all the more reason why she must bear this burden and move on.																						
269	269		201							1	500282	4																						
270	270		301							1	Selena	I think no thought or action that can be called progress or improvement is built upon the elimination of something that came before.	1																					
271	271		204							1	1																							
272	272		301								Selena	I really like that fantasy story.	1																					
273	273		202							1					1																			
274	274		301									She likes the play, the way she tried to create stories, the incomplete fantasy story, all her wildest imaginations that she put into it, and how she gave it her all to perfect the story. She went all out and even more than that.																						
275	275		301									She knows there is still a very long way to go. She once doubted herself. She was once rejected. But despite all that...																						
276	276		301									...The path she treads leads her to where she is now, whether that path is a winding trail or an easy road. All that happened to her made her who she is.																						
277	277		301									She is naive and innocent but also constantly making progress. She made mistakes but also atonement. She was a human and then a Construct. She was a writer and then a fighter.																						
278	278		301									It is without doubt and undeniable that she is herself whether she likes it or not. The pieces of the past complete her. All the wrong and right decisions and all her behaviors and thoughts are part of Selena.

281	281		301							1	Selena	After this operation is done, I am going to do two things.	2																					
282	282		301								Selena	I will attend the next WGAA party with my new frame.	2																					
283	283		301								Selena	And I will reimagine the original story in the most perfect way possible using Hamlet. It will include the new ending. I want everyone to see it.	2																					
284	284		301								Allen	Are you doing this to prove something or to get a new verdict?	1																					
285	285		301								Selena	I'm doing this to express myself and relive the past.	2																					
286	286		301									She is doing it to make progress and move on.																						
287	287		301								Allen	Even if the audience is going to mistake your message?	1																					
288	288		301								Selena	There is no such thing, Allen.	2																					
289	289		301								Selena	Why did you name the play machine Hamlet?	2																					
290	290		301								Selena	There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's eyes.	2

305	305		302								I'm awake.	306	I recorded that melody.	306																				
306	306		301									Ayla looks at you nervously. One can only imagine how much anxiety she has gone through during this time.																						
307	307		301									You wonder if you went missing, would someone try to find you and hope for your return as desperately as Ayla wants to find her.																						
308	308		301									This thought in your mind quickly fades away like mist because there is a more important matter to attend to right now.																						
309	309		302								I'm sure that's the second half of the whale song.	310	I have recorded the message. We can use the machine to analyze it.	312																				
310	310		301								Ayla	...That means...	1																					
311	311		302								That means Selena might still be alive.	316
