3	3		301			DialogEnable						By the time the last Corrupted is defeated, the celebration inside the Forsaken camp is already coming to a close.																						
4	4		201							1	500005																							
5	5		301							1	Guard Leader	Reporting, Sir! We've finished inspecting, and there is only minimal damage to the camp with no casualties. No one has even noticed the Corrupted were here.	1																					
6	6		201							1	1101001																							
7	7		301							1	Watanabe	Hmm... How about the Babylonian? We're in trouble if our supplier gets injured...	1																					
8	8		401							2	1509																							
9	9		301									The CUB nearby stands up and makes a low electronic sound toward one of the checkpoints. Watanabe raises an arm, and the Patrol Leader slowly approaches the checkpoint.																						
10	10		201							1	500005																							
11	11		301							1	Patrol Leader	The... "supplier" is here indeed. So are the kids.	1																					
12	12		202							1					1																			
13	13		301									Watanabe breathes a sigh of relief. He looks at the children sleeping in each others' arms, with their slow, deep breaths.																						
14	14		301									Without a word, he removes his jacket and walks up.																						
15	15		201							1	1101001																							
16	16		301							1	Watanabe	Only children would do something like that.	1																					
17	17		202							1					1																			
18	18		301									It might have been a lament, or maybe acceptance. Watanabe covers the sleeping children with his blanket, his motion remarkably gentle.																						
19	19		301									The soldiers standing around also approach, carefully picking up the children and carrying them to a tent inside the camp along the paved trail.																						
20	20		301									Watanabe stays behind and walks toward you, crouching and shaking you awake.																						
21	21		201							1	1101001																							
22	22		301							1	Watanabe	You awake yet, „Äêkuroname„Äë? You helped with the decoration, didn't you?	1																					
23	23		302								(Shake head)	24	(Yawn)	25																				
24	24	26	301								Watanabe	Is that so? I'll leave it, then.	1																					
25	25		301								Watanabe	Seems like it took a lot of effort.	1																					
26	26		204							1	1																							
27	27		301								Watanabe	Even when they're forsaken on Earth, kids are still gonna be kids... With their kid logic and priorities and choices.	1																					
28	28		301								Watanabe	Some things don't get taken away by a catastrophe. That's why I stayed behind.	1																					
29	29		301								Watanabe	And you, and your garden of Eden... should know this better than I do.	1																					
30	30		302							9563	I... can submit a request.	33	Babylonia may be able to help raise them.	34																				
31	31		204							1																								
32	32		303							9563																								
33	33	35	301									A frown flashes over Watanabe's face for a second, and then he is his usual, calm self again, shaking his head.																						
34	34		301									Watanabe holds his hand up, indicating that this is the end of this discussion.																						
35	35		301								Watanabe	I don't think a fake paradise like Babylonia will provide them with a real future.	1																					
36	36		301								Watanabe	The silly, purposeless decorations, the childlike innocence, and the essence of a human being...	1																					
37	37		301								Watanabe	The only thing we can build upon is the thing they grasp in their hands.	1																					
38	38		302								Do you mean... their creativity?	39	Do you mean... their hope?	39																				
39	39		301								Watanabe	Maybe. But whatever it is, they are the children of the Forsaken, and they are the future of humankind.	1																					
40	40		204							1	1																							
41	41		301									Watanabe pats the CUB next to him, and his expression softens.																						
42	42		301								Watanabe	It's not how powerful they are on the battlefield... It's the other thing, the feeling you have when you know you have it by your side...	1																					
43	43		302								That's what Asimov meant by "partner," I think.	44																						
44	44		301									Watanabe does not answer you. He goes ahead and disconnects with the CUB, letting it revert to its standby state.																						
45	45		301								Watanabe	The location of our delivery is the outpost of the abandoned city you marked?	1																					
46	46		301								Watanabe	About a station away from there is a supply port of ours. It's a neutral zone and close to Babylonia's outpost.	1																					
47	47		301								Watanabe	I'll take you there now.	1																					
48	48		301								Watanabe	I wanted to say that I needed a ride, but I don't see why I need to hide from you.	1																					
49	49		301								Watanabe	I've been asked to keep you safe, „Äêkuroname„Äë, understood? I know it's supposed to be your solo mission, but we better be safe than sorry.	1

52	52		301							1	Guard Leader	Mr. Watanabe, Sir, you're leaving already?	1																					
53	53		301								Patrol Leader	Hold on, Sir, you said you'd cook for us when we're back!	2																					
54	54		301								Guard Leader	...We never get to taste your dishes! Do you really have to go now?	1																					
55	55		301									The soldiers all put down the supplies they are collecting, sounding disappointed.																						
56	56		302							977	Do we really need to go now?	60	I... also want to try your cooking.	61

60	60	62	301							1	Watanabe	Yes, we do, pronto.	1																					
61	61		301							1	Watanabe	That's... for another day.	1																					
62	62		301								Watanabe	Winter is coming, and our to-do list is unusually long‚Äî	1																					
63	63		301								Watanabe	„Äêkuroname„Äë, we'll leave the other businesses for the next time we meet. As for you guys‚Äî	1																					
64	64		301									Watanabe snaps his finger at his people.																						
65	65		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Watanabe	Plan's not changing. We'll see when I get back.	1
