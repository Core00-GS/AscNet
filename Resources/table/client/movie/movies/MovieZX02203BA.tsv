5	6		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The logs have been arranged from left to right chronologically by Liv. Your fingertip flips over a page, and another memory is reawakened in your mind.

13	13		301							1	Hassen	First of all, congratulations on completing this confidential special ops. Gray Raven can finally take a rest in the coming days.	1																					
14	14		302								"Confidential special ops"...	15	Rest?	15																				
15	15		301								Hassen	That's right. You must be able to tell from reuniting with your team that Kurono's control over Gray Raven has been dismantled by us.	1																					
16	16		301								Hassen	You have proven yourself with your actions, and it's only fair that we reward you with more than just empty words and congratulations.	1																					
17	17		301								Hassen	When you're back on Babylonia, we will host the grandest welcome ceremony for you.	1																					
18	18		302								It's not just to congratulate me, I suppose.	19	...	20																				
19	19	22	301								Hassen	Haha, you're smart. Now's a pretty good time to do this...	1																					
20	20		301								Hassen	Your reaction seems to suggest that you've got something to say.	1																					
21	21		301								Hassen	You're a smart person. I suppose this is not that bad a time.	1																					
22	22		301									Hassen smiles and nods.																						
23	23		301								Hassen	After this ceremony, Gray Raven will no longer be an ordinary squad under the Task Force but war heroes that make the impossible possible.	1																					
24	24		301								Hassen	The people will follow you. They will look up to you. You have brought them a spark of hope for victory and overcome desperate situations time and time again.	1																					
25	25		301								Hassen	They will see every move the Gray Ravens make.	1																					
26	26		301								Hassen	And because of that, Kurono can no longer take Gray Raven away—from the people.	1																					
27	27		302								Is this necessary?	28	Why this?	29																				
28	28	30	301								Hassen	Absolutely. People are looking for heroes—for hopes that will bring the war to an end, and the Gray Ravens are the perfect candidates.	1																					
29	29		301								Hassen	Because people are looking for heroes—for hopes that will bring the war to an end, and the Gray Ravens are the perfect candidates.	1																					
30	30		301								Hassen	To carry out this plan, Gray Raven's main mission in the coming days will be to boost morale in each fighting region to establish people's hope for victory.	1																					
31	32		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Hassen	That's what the people want, and that's how we protect you.	1

39	39		301									Apart from returning to Babylonia to hand in your mission logs, you and the Gray Ravens have spent most of your time going from safe zone to safe zone among different areas on the surface, far away from the frontline.																						
40	40		301									It might be more free carrying out the Parliament's mission and being forbidden to contact some people than being locked in Kurono's cell, this overprotection has nonetheless grown weary on you.																						
41	41		301									The Babylonia night is still far from over. You open the mission log on the desk to confirm the final details before submitting.
