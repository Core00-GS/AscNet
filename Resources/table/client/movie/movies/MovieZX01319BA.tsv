14	14		301							1	Nanami	Let's see... Nanami has save-data for "Iron Formation BX," "Space Jack," "Danger Zone 2055," and "Bitter Villa." How many ice creams can Nanami get?	2																					
15	15		301							1	Sophia	One.	1

30	30		301									Liv is wearing an unforeseen solemn expression. You can only surrender.

32	32		301							1	Liv	We can't let anything happen to Commandant before we return to Babylonia for a full check.	2																					
33	33		301							1	Lucia	...So, does this mean... Commandant can't play with us?	1																					
34	34		301							1	Lucia	And just when Commandant got an extended vacation because of the injuries...	1																					
35	35		301							1	Liv	Lucia, that's because it might be dangerous to fly in Commandant's current condition. That's why President Hassen extended the vacation time for recovery...	2																					
36	999001		301								Liv	...And Celica—for some reason—sent over a whole set of things labeled "Summer Paradise Experience Pack" via a transport craft...	2

41	39		301									Lee, who has joined the three of you at some point in time, hands you a box of porridge-like thing.																						
42	40		301							2	Lee	Here, a synthetic porridge, jujube flavored. I used the food stall over there and made it following the recipe.	2																					
43	41		301							2	Lee	Most of the theme park facilities have been repaired. According to Asimov, we can run a power test today.	2																					
44	999003		302								You all changed into beach clothes, huh...	42																						
45	42		301									But, the underground is still closed off for now. Tentative measures were taken to disconnect the pump room from the ground through... explosions, to stop the spread of the Corrupted.																						
46	43		301									Follow-up troops will have to go deep inside the dead zone here and clear out the remaining Corrupted... Hopefully not Gray Raven.

48	45		301							1	Lucia	They're all playing.	1																					
49	46		301							1	Lucia	They're saying that they have to fully enjoy the legendary theme park before the transport crafts arrive.	1

79	76		301									After a nigh-eternity and countless sacrifices, counterattack is finally on the horizon for Babylonia.
