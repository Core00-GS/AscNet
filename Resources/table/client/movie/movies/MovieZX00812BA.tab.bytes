7	6		301								Liv	The energy inside the chamber is... being absorbed by Kamui! His M.I.N.D. is overheating!	1

11	10		301							1	Bianca	Karen's situation might happen again if this continues! The Tenebrion he's consuming is too powerfulâ€”we have to remove the threat before it gets out of hand!	1																					
12	11		302								I think there's still hope...	12																						
13	12		301								Lucia	Indeed. Just like Karen's case, we might be able to save Kamui with the same method.	2

17	16		301							1	Bianca	No, I won't let you go through with that. This risk is far greater than Karenina's condition.	1

19	17		301								Lucia	But it's still worth a try... Kamui, he is our companion.	2

27	24		301							1	Lee	I'm afraid our lives will be much more boring in the future without this guy lightening the mood.	2																					
28	25		301								Lee	But most importantly, I dislike farewells just as much as I hate fighting my own companions.	2																					
29	26		201							2	1031001	14	-400																					
30	27		301							1	Liv	I don't like them as well. I was afraid of Lee's situation just now and... s-so, if the same thing happened again... Bianca, please, wait for a bit more.	2

34	30		301								Liv	The viral density has nearly dropped to zero! There won't be a corruption risk if we establish a connection now!	2																					
35	31		301								Bianca	I understand. Then let me join you and see this through to the end.	1																					
36	32		302								Thank you.	33
