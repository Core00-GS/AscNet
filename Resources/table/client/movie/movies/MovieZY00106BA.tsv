7	6		301									After passing all the trials, you arrive at an open space with barely any decorations, and in the center is a familiar-looking crate.

21	13		301								Foreman	Ought to have a human as the Taoist, oughtn't we?	1																					
22	1009		302								That crate...	14	Have you been watching?	15																				
23	14	16	301								Foreman	Right, of course. Take it back! We haven't touched a single thing inside.	1																					
24	15	16	301								Foreman	I've been monitoring the whole place through those recon drones above you.	1																					
25	16		301									With that, Foreman turns around and gestures dramatically like a Master of Ceremonies.																						
26	17		301								Foreman	As you can see, this group called Gray Raven has passed all of our trials, and is the first to set foot in this place!	1																					
27	18		301								Foreman	Therefore, it is my honor to announce that Gray Raven is the winner of this year's Fist of the Taoist, and their commandant, 【kuroname】, shall be crowned the Taoist Supreme!	1

37	23		301							1	Foreman	I'll answer what I can... and Foreman is fine.	2																					
38	24		301								Liv	In that case, Foreman... We found out during our trial that this place was originally a factory, and you... Are you all mechanoids that weren't evacuated?	1																					
39	25		301								Foreman	Probably. I remember the chief foreman, who, y'know, was the foreman in charge, telling all the humans to evacuate immediately, so those folks all followed him and left.	2																					
40	26		301								Liv	And... you all stayed behind because the evacuation order didn't include you...	1																					
41	27		301								Foreman	That's right, and we've been wandering in this place ever since.	2

50	31		301							1	Liv	Will you consider relocating after this? Babylonia has set up several bases on the surface...	1																					
51	32		301								Foreman	No, I don't think so. I think we will stay.	2																					
52	33		301								Liv	Even when it's dangerous?	1																					
53	34		301								Foreman	Because this place is filled with our memories of the ol' days. We've been commemorating the chief foreman and the humans even when it isn't the Ghost Festival.	2

65	41		301								Lee	It's the drones! Liv, protect Commandant!																						
66	42		301								Liv	Copy!																						
67	43		301									Lucia and Lee believe the light to be a sign of danger, and they immediately draw their weapons while Liv watches the surroundings.
