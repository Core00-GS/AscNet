4	4		301									After deliberating with Haicma and Spooner, Nanami came to this place alone, paying attention to her surroundings all the way.

6	6		301							1	Nanami	Just come out, will you? I don't have much time.	1																					
7	7		301								Nanami	I know what you've done to Power, and I've picked up on all the signals. Good job fooling the heat sensors by staying around the furnace, but none of your little tricks will ever work on me.	1

11	11		301									A man rises from the pile of metallic rubbish beside the furnace. Clad in black, the man is covered in a worn-down military exo-skeleton and a thick cloak. Half of his face is covered by a mask.																						
12	12		301									He remains very calm, just putting his hands up high to show he has no hostile intentions.																						
13	13		301									Nanami feels more confused when he actually stands in front of her.																						
14	14		204							1	7																							
15	15		301								Nanami	Are you... a human?	1																					
16	16		301									The man probably escaped the sensors because he has no pulse, and his body temperature is quite low. Still, Nanami can detect breathing and life signals in him.																						
17	17		301								Man-In-Black	You could say that.	2																					
18	18		204							1																								
19	19		301									The man puts down his arms. His cloak moves slightly with his action, showing the battery of the vital circulatory device on his waist—he seems to have had a bad wound. Now he is a half-mechanoid.																						
20	20		301								Man-In-Black	I saw you in the fortress, taking so much attack without a scratch. Nanami, the powerful leader of the machines. Is that right?	2																					
21	21		204							1	14																							
22	22		301								Nanami	I wasn't aware of what happened back then... So...	1																					
23	23		301								Man-In-Black	I understand that you were scared, and I won't blame you for that. After all, as leader of the machines, you know better than anyone else... what the machines have done to humankind.	2																					
24	24		204							1	4																							
25	25		301								Nanami	Believe it or not... but this isn't at all what I hoped to see. Since you're from the human side, could you just help me spread this message...	1																					
26	26		301									Nanami stops cold—she knows that a mere message will achieve nothing if they do nothing to change the situation. The machines will just keep fighting, and humans will just fight back, too.																						
27	27		204							1	14																							
28	28		301								Nanami	...It was me... I failed.	1																					
29	29		301								Man-In-Black	Great minds think alike. The other humans might be scared of you, but I'm not. My brother told me that you were once friends with Gray Raven.	2																					
30	30		204							1	7																							
31	31		301								Nanami	Gray Raven?! Do you know Commandant? And Lucia, Liv, and Lee?! A-are they... still alive?	1																					
32	32		301									The man falls silent, keeping his gaze on the girl as if contemplating how best to answer her questions.																						
33	33		301								Man-In-Black	...Well, I suppose you can say I know them. There's no point hiding who I am now.	2																					
34	34		204							1																								
35	35		301									He reaches out a hand and tells her his name.																						
36	36		301								Man-In-Black	My name is Murray, Lee's brother. I have seen 【kuroname】 a few times.	2																					
37	37		301									Nanami grabs his hand.																						
38	38		204							1	4																							
39	39		301								Nanami	Can you tell me how they are doing?	1																					
40	40		204							2	2																							
41	41		301								Murray	We're all doing pretty well actually. 【kuroname】 has been promoted, and I am the Gray Raven Commandant now. Haha! So I do end up fighting alongside Lee...	2																					
42	42		204							1	14																							
43	43		401							1	36

47	47		401							1	33																							
48	48		204							2	14																							
49	49		301								Murray	This happened quite a while ago... but the experiment with the new specialized frame failed. Being the first specialized frame, Liv died fighting the twins.	2																					
50	50		204							1	7																							
51	51		301								Nanami	Liv... Empyrea...	1																					
52	52		301									Nanami tries to remember the key terms Murray mentioned.																						
53	53		204							2																								
54	54		301								Murray	The war intensified quickly after that. The Church of Machina showed up and hit humankind harder than the Punishing Virus, and our resources either "decayed" or were stolen by the machines.	2																					
55	55		204							1	14																							
56	56		301								Murray	We can't even leave Earth... The Church of Machina is trying to wipe out humankind.	2																					
57	57		301								Murray	When a captain dies on our side, one of their subordinates takes their place, and when a general dies, one of their soldiers takes their place—and so on until there is no one left.	2																					
58	58		204							2	14																							
59	59		301								Murray	【kuroname】 isn't a commandant anymore because both Hassen and Nikola... have passed.	2																					
60	60		301								Nanami	H-Hassen...	1																					
61	61		301								Murray	This happened a month ago when humans lost the biggest underwater fort we had along with our leaders.	2																					
62	62		301								Murray	Strike Hawk went down into the fort to save the soldiers who stayed behind to protect the children there. Wanshi was the only one who made it back with a dead infant in his arms.	2																					
63	63		301								Murray	Captain Bianca from Purifying Force became a "witch" after picking up a weapon made with the Punishing Virus. She eventually sank with the fort into the depths of a contaminated ocean.	2																					
64	64		301								Murray	【kuroname】 and I are survivors of that battle.	2																					
65	65		301								Murray	【kuroname】 lost both hands from an infection, but a lack of resources meant we couldn't replace them with advanced prosthetics. 【kuroname】 had no choice but to leave the frontline and take over as humanity's leader.	2																					
66	66		204							2																								
67	67		301								Murray	The remaining Gray Ravens kept the name as a symbol of resistance for humankind, with Wanshi taking over Liv's place. Most of the time, Gray Raven fights without a commandant, and I try to help where I can when I can.	2																					
68	68		301								Murray	Lucia and Lee need to take turns fighting now because we're short on maintenance parts, but Gray Raven is still fighting, and they're still humanity's best champions.	2

81	81		301								Murray	Cerberus was cornered to a dead end, but Vera traded her life with mine.	2																					
82	82		301									Lowering his head, Murray looks at his fingers, half of which are now robotic. He laughs, apparently at himself.																						
83	83		301								Murray	But was it worth it? I may have survived, but I couldn't even keep the heart Lee gave me.	2

92	92		301								Murray	WGAA wasn't able to evacuate in time, trying to rescue all the Golden Age relics when the machines invaded Babylonia. Their landing went wrong, and they all burned to death with the very relics they were trying to save.	2																					
93	93		301									Murray speaks with a flat tone.																						
94	94		301								Murray	We lost contact with ARU, Akdilek, and Kowloong as soon as the war began. While we did manage to join up with some of their lost soldiers later, they had nothing but bad news to share.	2																					
95	95		301								Murray	Forsaken became nothing more than a bunch of severely infected souls. Rumor was Watanabe had to put an end to their suffering by...	2																					
96	96		301								Nanami	...Enough.	1																					
97	97		301								Murray	But you were the one who asked, no? What are you feeling now? Disdain? Guilt? This is the world we live in, and I can go on and on telling you about our suffering if you want.	2

102	102		301							1		Raising her head, Nanami is on the verge of tears, yet her tone is not relenting.																						
103	103		301								Nanami	You told me all that because you were afraid Nanami wouldn't "betray" the Church of Machina, taking away humanity's chance to survive, right?	1																					
104	104		301								Murray	...	2																					
105	105		301								Nanami	You came to me because you wanted to save someone. Am I right?	1

110	110		301								Murray	...	2																					
111	111		301									With Nanami—founder of the Church of Machina—standing right before him, Murray cannot keep his cool completely. What he has said, however, has gotten into Nanami. Murray contemplates his next move.																						
112	112		301									Nanami pauses for a moment, then speaks again.																						
113	113		301								Nanami	...Nanami hasn't exactly figured out what "Gear" is planning, but...	1																					
114	114		301								Nanami	If "Niflheim" is humanity's last base, then you'd all better run now.	1																					
115	115		301								Nanami	Zero plans on dealing humankind one last blow tomorrow, but I'll do my best to stall "Gear" and buy you time.	1																					
116	116		301									Nanami gives Murray the transmitter that belongs to the Church of Machina she got from Haicma.																						
117	117		301								Nanami	I'll keep you updated on "Gear" with this transmitter. Don't bring it back to your base, though, because the Church of Machina can trace you through it.	1																					
118	118		301								Nanami	Hope it can help.	1																					
119	119		301									To her surprise, Murray takes it without a word. His metal fingertips feel cold when they touch her palm.

142	142		301									These orders circulate among the machines. As sudden as the orders are, they are chalked up as Sage's eccentricity.																						
143	143		301									Unable to think up an effective plan, Nanami resorts to organizing a gathering as a way to minimize the number of machines heading onto the battlefield. There is, however, no telling if this is going to hold the army back for real.
