4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Lucia	Commandant.	1																					
5	5		301								Lucia	I still don't think they suit me.	1																					
6	6		301								Lucia	They look good but I just feel a bit on edge when using this frame.	1																					
7	7		302								You said it looks good!	8	You don't feel comfortable?	9																				
8	8	10	301								Lucia	Twin tails do not match my style.	1																					
9	9		301								Lucia	It's just that... How should I phrase it... I'm not used to it...	1																					
10	10		301								Lucia	I only know how to fight, so I've always focused on weapons and strength... I've never cared about appearances before.	1																					
11	11		301								Lucia	But ever since you came after I received this frame, I've felt a bit strange.	1																					
12	12		302								What's that got to do with me?	13	Strange?	13																				
13	13		301								Lucia	Yes.	1																					
14	14		301								Lucia	I started to care about what people thought of me and what kind of impression I left...	1																					
15	15		301								Lucia	It's all useless for executing missions.	1																					
16	16		301								Lucia	But I can't stop myself from thinking about it... This feeling, maybe I can only erase it by rebooting...	1																					
17	17		302								You're afraid of change?	18	I won't allow that.	19																				
18	18	20	301								Lucia	I'm afraid.	1																					
19	19		301								Lucia	I know, which is why I can only try to make myself forget these feelings.	1																					
20	20		301								Lucia	If I accepted them, I may become an entirely different Lucia than I am now.	1																					
21	21		301								Lucia	Is it really alright for someone like me to feel like that?	1																					
22	22		302								You are you, Lucia.	23	I'll still be by your side no matter what happens.	24																				
23	23	25	301								Lucia	You're always like that...	1																					
24	24		301								Lucia	You're always like that, Commandant... Always coming up with straightforward and surprising solutions.	1																					
25	25		301								Lucia	I can now confirm that Commandant is the root of these problems.	1																					
26	26		302								My fault?	27	(Apologize first)	27																				
27	27		301								Lucia	So, um... The twin tails, do you think they look good, Commandant?	1																					
28	28		302								I love twin tails!	29	You look really good with twin tails!	29																				
29	29		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Commandant... It's a bit embarrassing hearing that from you...	1
