4	4		301			DialogEnable				1		As time goes by, you have visited more stalls and Pulao keeps getting more prizes. Apart from the mask she won in the shooting bottle game, there are other little gadgets like a panda keychain, robot model, dancing princess sticker, wooden knife...																						
5	5		301									As Pulao walks, the gadgets bump into one another, adding more knocking noise to her laughter.																						
6	6		301									The fierce Dragon Child is gone. Pulao is taking little bites at the cotton candy in her hand. She looks just like an ordinary girl who is having so much fun.																						
7	7		301									In your hand are two discount coupons of Foon's Morning Tea—the mega prize you just won in the shooting game.																						
8	8		302								Why are we having it at lunch time if it's called "morning tea"?	9																						
9	9		301								Pulao	Um... I don't know. But as long as it tastes good, names don't matter.	1																					
10	10		301								Pulao	Too bad that you only played two rounds before the owner asked you to leave, Commandant.	1																					
11	11		301				DialogDisable				Pulao	But he was almost crying...	1																					
12	12		302								Speaking of my name...	13																						
13	13		302								If you call me "Commandant"...	14																						
14	14		302								Wouldn't that expose ourselves?	15																						
15	15		301			DialogEnable					Pulao	You're right. From now on, I will call you 【kuroname】. And you can call me... Laopu!	1																					
16	16		302								Are you sure that will work?	17	Can you think of another name?	17																				
17	17		204							1	2																							
18	18		301								Pulao	Don't worry. Nobody is going to find out.	1																					
19	19		204							1																								
20	20		301								Pulao	Look, Commandant, that's the morning tea store I mentioned earlier. His char siu buns are the best. Let's go!	1																					
21	21		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Pulao	I can smell the food already! It must be char siu bun! Wait for me!	1

26	26		204							1	2																							
27	27		301									Pulao's vision module seems to be locked onto the steaming hot pastries. The drool down her mouth already gives the answer.																						
28	28		302								Char siu bun.	29																						
29	29		301								Uncle Foon	Great pick. My char siu buns are the best in the West District. How many would you like?	2																					
30	30		301									Pulao first holds out 3 fingers but shakes her head. She then extends all 5 fingers. Her eyes are sparkling.																						
31	31		302								I'll have five.	32																						
32	32		301								Uncle Foon	Five char siu buns? No problem.	2																					
33	33		301								Pulao	Not five buns! Five steamers of buns! Steamers!	1																					
34	34		204							1	11																							
35	35		301									Pulao interrupts the conversation, but when Uncle Foon looks over, she soon lowers her head and stares at the floor tile.																						
36	36		301								Uncle Foon	Five steamers? My buns are quite filling. Are you sure you can finish?	2																					
37	37		204							1																								
38	38		301									You look at Pulao in doubt. She seems to have noticed it. Her head is rapidly nodding like a tally counter.																						
39	39		302								We can.	40																						
40	40		301								Uncle Foon	Fine, as long as you don't waste food. Dine-in or take away?	2																					
41	41		302								We will have them here. Can I use these coupons?	42																						
42	42		301								Uncle Foon	Wow, I didn't know you were a sharpshooter. Of course.	2																					
43	43		301								Uncle Foon	Alright, take a seat. I'll bring the buns to you later.	2

47	47		301									Pulao looks around and points at a square table. There is already a diner sitting there.																						
48	48		301								Pulao	Com... 【kuroname】, let's sit at that table.	1																					
49	49		301									She lowers her voice, tips her toes and whispers in your ear.																						
50	50		204							1	11																							
51	51		301								Pulao	I want to take this chance to ask the civilians their opinion on the Dragon Children. We played too much that I almost forgot my task.	1																					
52	52		301									Finally remembering why she changed her outfit in the first place, Pulao seems a little embarrassed.																						
53	53		204							1																								
54	54		301								Pulao	Excuse me, do you mind if we sit here?	1

56	56		201							2	500236		400																					
57	57		301							1	Diner	No problem at all. I'll move a little.	2																					
58	58		301									Pulao carefully takes off the gadgets. Soon, the bench is covered with all sorts of toys.																						
59	59		301								Diner	You don't look like toy sellers. Why so many goodies?	2																					
60	60		204							1	11																							
61	61		301								Pulao	We aren't. We won them in games.	1																					
62	62		301								Diner	There are lots of stalls in the West, but they are quite difficult. It must take some serious skill to get so many prizes. Do you play very often?	2																					
63	63		301								Pulao	Not very often...	1																					
64	64		301								Diner	It must be talent then.	2																					
65	65		301								Diner	You don't look very familiar. Where are you from?	2																					
66	66		204							1																								
67	67		301								Pulao	The Central District.	1																					
68	68		301								Diner	Oh, Central is great. The busiest place on the ship, though the Dragon Children live there as well.	2

71	71		401							1	211																							
72	72		301									The diner's unintentional words make Pulao frown again. She opens her mouth as if she wants to mutter something, but fear and concerns stop her.																						
73	73		301									She looks at you, seeking help.																						
74	74		302								Where are the buns...	75	Give her an encouraging look.	77																				
75	75		204							1	4																							
76	76	78	301									Pulao puffs out her cheeks, visibly upset at your lousy acting skill.																						
77	77		301									Pulao bites her lips and makes up her mind.																						
78	78		301									After taking a deep breath, she carefully picks her words.																						
79	79		204							1	14																							
80	80		301								Pulao	Does everyone dislike... um, hate the Dragon Children?	1																					
81	81		301								Diner	...	2																					
82	82		301									The silence seems to already give Pulao an answer. She continues asking.																						
83	83		301								Pulao	But the Dragon Children helped everyone to return to their home. Why can't they forgive them?	1																					
84	84		301									Pulao raises her voice without realizing it, as if she is voicing out all the grievances over the past days. You feel like this is the only way she can catch a break from all the misunderstandings.																						
85	85		301									The diner is apparently stunned by the serious tone of this "little girl," who was only playing with her prizes moments ago.																						
86	86		204							1	11																							
87	87		301								Pulao	Sorry... I shouldn't talk like that.	1																					
88	88		301								Diner	It's fine. It's just that... You're just a kid. You don't need to know.	2																					
89	89		204							1	14																							
90	90		301								Pulao	But I want to.	1																					
91	91		301									The diner turns to you instead and remains quiet. He seems to be asking your opinion.																						
92	92		302								I want to hear it too.	93																						
93	93		301								Diner	Alrighty. I'll talk about it then.	2																					
94	94		301								Diner	Young lady, let me ask you first. Do you want the Nighter to go back to what it used to be?	2																					
95	95		301								Pulao	Of course not!	1																					
96	96		301								Diner	Neither do I. In that sense, I am grateful to the Dragon Children and other outsiders to save us from that hell. If only they could have come sooner.	2																					
97	97		301									The diner shakes his head, laughing at himself.																						
98	98		301								Diner	That's how I got greedy... After escaping from hell, nobody wants to go back.	2																					
99	99		301								Diner	But I didn't do anything for this precious freedom. It's like rainwater in a desert. I need it, but I don't know how I can get it, or how I can protect it.	2																					
100	100		301								Diner	After a short moment of joy, I fell into fear.	2																					
101	101		301								Diner	Are the Dragon Children on our side? Will they control us like the former leader? What can we do if they really do so?	2																					
102	102		301								Diner	Besides, all the new constructions on the Nighter were done by the Dragon Children themselves. Ordinary people like us could do nothing but simple businesses. It makes me feel like...	2																					
103	103		301									He swallows with hesitation and finally speaks weakly.																						
104	104		301								Diner	Like there is no security in life. It's like I'm living on floating ice.	2																					
105	105		301								Diner	I don't hate them. In fact, I don't even dislike them.	2																					
106	106		301								Diner	I just don't know how to face them.	2																					
107	107		301								Pulao	Sorry, I never knew...	1																					
108	108		301								Diner	What are you sorry about? I feel much better after saying it out.	2																					
109	109		301								Diner	Uncle Foon, another white porridge please.	2																					
110	110		301								Diner	But I never thought you would care about the Dragon Children so much. Aren't you scared of them?	2																					
111	111		301								Pulao	I have never hated them.	1																					
112	112		301								Diner	What about you?	2																					
113	113		302								I believe in them.	114																						
114	114		204							1																								
115	115		301								Diner	...	2																					
116	116		301								Diner	Sigh. Now I have become the bad guy.	2																					
117	117		301								Diner	It's true that some people are wary of the Dragon Children because they have done something dodgy in the past. It must have become a reflex. I probably shouldn't say this to you though.	2																					
118	118		301									The conversation is interrupted by hot, steaming buns.																						
119	119		201							2	500462		400																					
120	120		301							1	Uncle Foon	Here come the buns! And you, don't make a sweeping statement like that.	2																					
121	121		301									Uncle Foon puts down five steamers of buns and one bowl of white porridge as he talks to the diner.																						
122	122		301								Uncle Foon	I only stayed on the ship because of the Dragon Children. Without them, I would have died long ago.	2																					
123	123		301								Uncle Foon	Sigh. Who would have thought the leader could change so much the moment we set sail?	2																					
124	124		301								Uncle Foon	Some Dragon Children like to buy char siu buns from me. But they all wear masks and don't talk a lot.	2																					
125	125		301								Pulao	Really? Which one?	1																					
126	126		301								Uncle Foon	Um, Yaci? Not sure if I have said it correctly. I can't read.	2																					
127	127		301								Uncle Foon	Oh, and there's another one I know. His name is Chaofeng. But he always hangs down from the ceiling at night. It freaks me out.	2																					
128	128		301								Pulao	Pff, I'll remind him not to.	1																					
129	129		301								Uncle Foon	?	2																					
130	130		302								Ahem, Laopu.																							
131	131		204							1	11																							
132	132		301								Pulao	Oh, because... I live in the Central street. So I get to speak to the Dragon Children occasionally.	1																					
133	133		201							2	500236		400																					
134	134		301							1	Diner	No wonder you care about them that much.	2																					
135	135		301								Diner	Anyway, you said you could speak to the Dragon Children, didn't you?	2																					
136	136		301								Pulao	Yeah.	1																					
137	137		301								Diner	Could you ask the Bixi Crew in charge of constructions...	2																					
138	138		301									There is hesitation, fear and remorse on his face. His mouth is trembling. Pulao just calmly stares at him and waits.																						
139	139		301									Finally, he gulps down the white porridge in front like it is some sort of alcohol.																						
140	140		301								Diner	Gargh, it's hot! Actually, I used to be an engineer. My design even won some awards.	2																					
141	141		301								Diner	So... I can be of help too if they are in need.	2																					
142	142		301								Diner	Then the Bixi Crew won't have to start working before dawn. Everybody gets to sleep well...	2																					
143	143		204							1	12																							
144	144		301								Pulao	But aren't you scared of the Dragon Children?	1																					
145	145		301								Diner	Just like me, many people were forced to become tradesmen in order to earn miles.	2																					
146	146		301								Diner	It will be great if we can pick up the old jobs that we loved.	2																					
147	147		301								Diner	You and Uncle Foon make me feel like the Dragon Children aren't that scary. It's time for me to move on.	2																					
148	148		201							1	500462		-400																					
149	149		301							1	Uncle Foon	What are you talking about? She's not a Dragon Child, she can't do that for you. Go ask them yourself, you slippery punk.	1																					
150	150		301								Diner	I don't have the guts right now. Maybe next time, I promise!	2																					
151	151		201							1	500446	12	-400																					
152	152		301							1	Pulao	Hmm... I'll try.	1																					
153	153		301								Pulao	No, I'll make sure to pass your words properly!	1																					
154	154		301								Diner	Don't stress yourself, girl. I didn't mean it that seriously.	2																					
155	155		201							1	500462		-400																					
156	156		301							1	Uncle Foon	Is that how you ask for help?	1																					
157	157		301								Diner	My bad, my bad. Sorry.	2

162	162		202							1	2				1																			
163	163		301									Before you realize it, Pulao has already picked up the white buns and dug in.																						
164	164		301									Cognitive inertia often becomes an obstacle that stops people from seeking truth. For a while, you thought what happened here was but a replicate of Babylonia.																						
165	165		301									But on this land, humans don't have the prejudice against Constructs. It could be attributed to the difference in history or culture.																						
166	166		301									After breaking through the wall of misunderstanding, Pulao realizes the view on the other side isn't as dangerous as she thought. Her courage has paid off and brought her new motivation.
