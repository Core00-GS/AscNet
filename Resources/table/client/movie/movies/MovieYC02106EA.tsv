12	12		301			RImgBg1Shake						Her eyes bulge out as a sharp pain hits her nerves as if millions of steel needles are piercing through her skull. She opens her mouth to scream for help, only to swallow more cold sea water.

16	16		301									After a long time, Lamia's body has finally adapted to the hypergravity effect caused by the intense water pressure and settled down.

36	36		301								Medical Director	All readings normal and stable. It took some time, but she is already used to this new body.	2
