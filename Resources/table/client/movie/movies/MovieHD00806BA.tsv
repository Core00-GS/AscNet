4	4		301									The chime of notification suddenly rings inside Strike Hawk's lounge.																						
5	5		301									>>>>Mission notification delivered.																						
6	6		301									>>>>Construct: Wanshi. Mission selected.																						
7	7		301									As it rings, the dimly lit sleeping pod slowly opens up and awakes from sleep mode.																						
8	8		301									Inside sleeps one of the three members of Strike Hawk.																						
9	9		201							1	500273	8																						
10	10		301							1	Wanshi	Can't I catch a break for once... What's wrong this time...	1																					
11	11		301									Constructs technically do not require sleep, but waking up to a mission notification is still very irritating.																						
12	12		204							1																								
13	13		301								Wanshi	...Oh, this thing. We'll probably sort it out in a week.	1																					
14	14		301								Wanshi	But... what just... fell on my eye masks?	1																					
15	15		301									Taking off his mask, Wanshi finds two stickers attached to it, one for each eye. The stickers are red, with a golden "good fortune" written on them, and they look very festive.																						
16	16		301									Wanshi shakes his head helplessly.																						
17	17		301								Wanshi	...What a nuisance. Hey, Kamui.	1																					
18	18		301								Wanshi	They should be here at this hour. I should head out and take a look.	1																					
19	19		301									Wanshi gets up from his pod and discovers that something else is also attached to the two sides of it.																						
20	20		301								Wanshi	Aren't these couplets... Gotta hand it to him.	1																					
21	21		401							2	1516																							
22	22		202							1																								
23	23		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The notification ringtone is still going on in his comms, but Wanshi pays no attention. He grabs his gears and takes his time to head out.																						
24	24		201							1	500273																							
25	25		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Wanshi	Hey, Captain, did you know Kamui—	1																					
26	26		301									Rubbing his eyes, Wanshi notices both Chrome and Kamui are sleeping on the floor on top of the soft cushions.																						
27	27		301								Wanshi	...Fell asleep, huh?	1																					
28	28		301									In the main room of the lounge, a holographic display lies on the floor.																						
29	29		301									It is probably playing the performance review and related footage of Kamui on the battlefield.																						
30	30		301								Kamui	Zzz... Capt... let me do another one...																						
31	31		301									Seeing that the footage goes for at least a dozen hours, Wanshi cannot help but tremble.																						
32	32		301									He wonders if it was the boring lectures that bored Kamui to sleep, or if the obstinate Kamui had spent all of Chrome's energy.																						
33	33		301								Wanshi	...I guess I can skip the goodbyes. Great, if it means I can skip the scolding.	1																					
34	34		301									Wanshi turns to look at the couplets by his pod before looking at the sleeping Kamui, and his eyes narrow with an idea in mind.																						
35	35		301								Wanshi	Seeing that you pulled a prank on me—	1																					
36	36		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Wanshi	It's only polite to return the favor.	1																					
37	37		202							1					1																			
38	38		401							2	1516																							
39	39		301									And then the refreshed Strike Hawk member leaves the room with a yawn.																						
40	40		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						While the two sleeping members in the lounge are now covered with their own blankets.																						
41	41		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					"Kamui, replace my eye mask as a peace offering." is written on a piece of red paper, attached to Kamui's blanket.

45	45		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Ayla	Chairman, all the couplets have been given out today, and everyone seemed to like them.	1																					
46	46		301								Allen	That's wonderful news. Thanks for your hard work today, Ayla.	2																					
47	47		301								Ayla	Hard work indeed. Especially when we had to deal with Nikola...	1																					
48	48		301								Allen	Sigh, we'll get used to it.	2																					
49	49		204							1	4																							
50	50		301								Ayla	By the way... Can I take another set of couplets back?	1																					
51	51		301								Allen	Sure. Do you still have somewhere to decorate?	2																					
52	52		301									Ayla nods with a slight hint of sadness, and Allen can guess where she is planning to put them from her face.																						
53	53		301								Allen	Of course... You can go.	2																					
54	54		301								Ayla	Thank you, Chairman... Then I'll...	1																					
55	55		202							1																								
56	56		301									Ayla does a small parting gesture and turns to leave.																						
57	57		301								Allen	—Instead of just a beautifully decorated room, I think what Selena would want to see more when she returns is a happy, energetic Ayla. So, please, take care of yourself.	2																					
58	58		301									Ayla does not reply. She takes a deep breath, and then she smiles.																						
59	59		201							1	500110		-450																					
60	60		301							1	Ayla	Of course! I'm not giving up on her! I'm going to find her in the coming year!	1																					
61	61		204							2	1																							
62	62		301								Allen	That's good to hear. Happy New Year, then, Ayla—and may your wish come true.	2
