47	47		301									The children turn around and look at Nanami, who is deep in thought.

53	53		301									She gently pats the small approaching mechanoids and gestures to the children to pass her the decorations they made.

64	64		301									Nanami tilts her head and thinks, looking at the Xi running everywhere.																						
65	65		301								Nanami	...Sort of? I guess this is a mission, more or less... You know what? Yeah, Nanami is indeed on an important mission!	1																					
66	66		301									Ayla does not pay much attention to Nanami's speech to herself. She just takes out a pair of red couplets from her bag.																						
67	67		301								Ayla	I was trying to find you in your room earlier today only to find out you weren't there. I've prepared some New Year decorations for you!	2																					
68	68		301								Nanami	Couplets! They're so well written! Did you write them, Ayla?	1																					
69	69		301								Ayla	Of course not. It's from Yuan Ye, the CUB who was with you. Asimov said that being in contact with you guys has introduced it information on Lunar New Year, but I don't really understand what he was saying.	2																					
70	70		301								Nanami	I see! I can't believe that it's not just cute, it's also super smart!	1																					
71	71		301								Ayla	Right? I also think it's cute, but nobody seems to appreciate it... By the way, do you want me to put the couplets on for you?	2																					
72	72		301								Nanami	Um, sure...	1																					
73	73		301									She thinks for a second before shaking her head.																						
74	74		301								Nanami	Maybe not!	1																					
75	75		301								Nanami	Nanami wants to go back to Babylonia to do it herself! That's what makes it meaningful!	1																					
76	76		301								Ayla	Alright, then. I'll leave them on your desk!	2																					
77	77		301								Ayla	II have to head to my next stop to give out more couplets. Goodbye, Nanami! Happy New Year!	2																					
78	78		301								Nanami	Happy New Year, Ayla!	1

83	83		301								Nanami	In that case, Nanami has to take a trip to Babylonia, or else it would be very impolite!	1																					
84	84		301									Nanami is not sure why her free-spirited self needs to find an excuse to convince herself to return to Babylonia‚Äîperhaps something has changed, or maybe nothing has‚Äînot her, not Babylonia. Regardless...
