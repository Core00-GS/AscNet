5	5		301			DialogEnable				1	Construct A	Affiliation unknown, and there are no bionic machines infected with the virus in the group. Has the route alliance been fighting them?	1																					
6	6		301								Construct B	From our observations over our visit, this does seem to be the case. This is something that only happens in this polar region.	2

9	9		301							1	???	The numbers on the report shouldn't have any mistakes, right?	1																					
10	10		301									On the snow, a group of Constructs and a Commandant discuss the current situation.																						
11	11		301									The Commandant, who doesn't look in good shape, leans on a tree in the middle of the discussion to make it more comfortable. The Construct also express concern for his physical condition.																						
12	12		201							1	500019																							
13	13		301							1	Construct A	Commandant Simon, should we head back to the alliance Stronghold first?	1																					
14	14		201							1	500201	1																						
15	15		301							1	Simon	I have a little OCD, so I will be even more uncomfortable if I don't sort out the current problems.	1																					
16	16		301									And so he sits on the ground and picks up a fallen branch to make a map in the snow.	1																					
17	17		204							1																								
18	18		301								Simon	This route is not under attack by unknown bionic machines. Their defense is insufficient, so they have asked Babylonia to lend support.	1																					
19	19		301								Simon	And the higher ups have decided to divide the support in two stages. The first stage would be done by us, land forces that can be deployed immediately.	1																					
20	20		301								Simon	The second stage will be done by the support sent from Babylonia, led by one of the Forest Guard and named Rosetta.	1																					
21	21		201							1	500019																							
22	22		301								Construct A	So the support should be arriving in a few days, right?	1																					
23	23		201							1	500201																							
24	24		301								Simon	Yes. We can start various operations when they do, like driving off the bionic machines and taking back the occupied alliance ship route area...	1

27	27		301							1	???	I hear the support troops will also have their Commandant.	2																					
28	28		301								Simon	Atiel... Where did you run off to?	1																					
29	29		301									A Construct runs out of the forest, interrupting Simon's thoughts. The marks on her body show that she has been fighting something up to a moment ago.																						
30	30		204							1	10																							
31	31		301								Simon	Can't you listen to commands? You're always running around... I've stressed how important teamwork is, right?	1																					
32	32		204							2	5																							
33	33		301								Atiel	What I do is also beneficial to the battle. But I wonder how our ragtag team is going to match up with the Commandant the higher-ups sent.	2

35	35		201							1	500019																							
36	36		301							1	Construct A	It's true that we're temporary troops transferred from various teams, but can't you put it more nicely?	1

39	39		301							1	Atiel	Haha, sorry.	2																					
40	40		301								Simon	Including me, all of them were temporarily transferred... The main fighting force can only look to HQ.	1																					
41	41		301								Atiel	Simon, your face is all tensed up again. Relax!	2																					
42	42		301				PanelActor1Shake					So saying, Atiel slaps Simon hard on the back again. She means well and to encourage a comrade, but it is like a huge blow to Simon.																						
43	43		204							1	10

49	48		301									While Simon is still in pain, a message is suddenly transmitted from Babylonia.																						
50	49		301								System	—【kuroname】.																						
51	50		201							1	500201	10																						
52	51		301								Simon	Ahem... I see. Get the representative here... Ugh.	1

54	53		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Atiel	Talking as you throw up? You're pushing yourself too hard, Simon.	1
