5	5		301									All she knew was the medical department was swamped with people. Even Lustrous, who she had not seen for a long time, was there.

23	23		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Lamia finds herself on a clean hospital bed when she wakes up.																						
24	24		301									Her arms have become metal. The black shell and red joints glow under the pale white light.																						
25	25		301									There is a large black plate on her head that looks like the head of a hammerhead shark, made from the same metal used in her arms.

27	27		301									She cannot see the lower half of her body as it is covered under a blanket. But based on the metal parts on her waist, they are probably also replaced by machines.																						
28	28		301									Her brain gradually starts to recover from anesthesia, as if it has finally accepted the reality and realized it's not a dream.

34	34		301									The medical director mumbles to himself.																						
35	35		301								Medical Director	Hmm, there are some minor problems, but it's a success nonetheless. Can't ask for much more from the first trial.	1
