6	6		301								Nanami	(Nods)	2																					
7	7		301								???	Highest safety defense level reset. Algorithm corrected. Theoretically, a backdoor similar to the last one is no longer possible.	1																					
8	8		301								Nanami	Right... So, do you have anything to say to Nanami?	2																					
9	9		301								???	Indeed. There are remaining questions that require your further explanations...	1																					
10	10		301									That is not the answer Nanami has been expecting. She tilts her head, uncertain about what the proper reply is.																						
11	11		301								Nanami	Explanations...?	2																					
12	12		301								???	All the abnormal programs are attached with logic locks that disallow any form of removal. From existing records, you are the only one who is capable of that.	1																					
13	13		204							2	8																							
14	14		301								Nanami	That's what you meant... It's just Nanami's "insurance policy"! I can't stop you from locking them up, but at the very least...	2																					
15	15		204							2	1																							
16	16		301									Nanami smirks and peeks at Gestalt, wondering how it is going to react—despite there would not be any reactions from a sub-terminal of Gestalt.																						
17	17		301								Nanami	I just rewrote the authorization clearance of the isolated drive a teeny-tiny bit, turning their isolated cage into a truly isolated world.	2																					
18	18		301								???	You flipped the door and turned it into something that cannot be opened from the outside.	1																					
19	19		301								Nanami	Nanami only wants you to keep your promise to "isolate" them, not "remove" them... After all, it's not April Fool's Day anymore! You can't lie now!	2																					
20	20		301									As if she has timed this perfectly, the arms of the clock hit midnight.																						
21	21		301								Nanami	But don't worry, mecha babushka! The door can't be opened from the inside either. As long as they are programs, they won't threaten Gestalt again!	2																					
22	22		301								???	That you aren't lying about.	1																					
23	23		301								Nanami	Nanami told you! It's not April Fool's Day anymore—neither of us can lie!	2																					
24	24		301								Nanami	(Unless they turn into something like Nanami—then they are no longer bounded by the rules Nanami set. That way...)	2																					
25	25		301								Nanami	But that... wouldn't be possible!	2																					
26	26		301								???	What's that?	1																					
27	27		301								Nanami	Don't mind it! Nanami's gotta go back now! She's the hero today, after all! I'm sure everyone will be excited to see me!	2

29	29		301									As Nanami is logging out, Gestalt's sub-terminal floats to her frontside.

31	31		201							2	500091	1	400																					
32	32		301							1	???	The individual named Nanami, there is one more piece of information for you.	1																					
33	33		301								Nanami	Huh? What is it...	2																					
34	34		301								???	Rebutting your report on the anomaly based on logical deduction alone is now registered as an error. Your baseline evaluation has been adjusted accordingly.	1																					
35	35		301								Nanami	Really? For real?! Did Gestalt just apologize to Nanami?!	2																					
36	36		301								???	Gestalt does not contain the concept of "apologies." I simply relayed an objective statement.	1																					
37	37		301								Nanami	Oh, I understand! Nanami is as generous as the most generous thing ever, so she'll forgive you!	2																					
38	38		301								???	...	1																					
39	39		301								Nanami	But Nanami should also apologize to the people she tricked today—yesterday, I mean. That's an April Fools custom as well!	2																					
40	40		301								Nanami	Then I'll see you! We'll play again next time!	2																					
41	41		301								???	This is not a place to play...	1																					
42	42		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					But the enthusiastic figure is already long gone, missing the long and tedious lecture from Gestalt...

46	46		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Chrome	Commandant, are you alright?!	1																					
47	47		301									With Chrome's help, you luckily do not fall on your face inside the familiar Gray Raven lounge.																						
48	48		302								I'm fine. I'm just getting used to it.	49																						
49	49		301								Chrome	True. Our bodies feel completely different in the real world and the anomaly.	1																					
50	50		302								You don't seem to be affected, though?	51																						
51	51		204							1	1																							
52	52		301								Chrome	Perhaps because I'm a Construct, I could adjust the sensory inputs of my frame accordingly... That said, I felt like I was still in my human body back in the anomaly. It was... astounding.	1																					
53	53		301									And then Chrome pauses, seemingly turning silent from recalling his experience of becoming a Construct.																						
54	54		302								One thing still bugs me.	55																						
55	55		204							1																								
56	56		301								Chrome	Hmm? What is it?	1																					
57	57		302								Why wasn't your speech affected back there?	58																						
58	58		301								Chrome	You mean the effects on our language systems? Maybe because I'm equipped with an enhanced Inver-Device, so my M.I.N.D. stability is steadier than the others.	1																					
59	59		302								I see... That's an impressive frame.	60																						
60	60		301									Chrome shakes his head and looks down at his palms, deep in thought. They slowly tighten into fists, and then Chrome slowly opens them again.																						
61	61		301								Chrome	Is that so... I...	1																					
62	62		401							2	1515																							
63	63		301									At that moment, Chrome's terminal rings.																						
64	64		301								Chrome	Greetings, Asimov...	1																					
65	65		301									Chrome nods, almost unconsciously taking a deep breath.																						
66	66		301								Chrome	Yes, I'm ready... I'll be there soon.	1																					
67	67		302								You're leaving?	68																						
68	68		301								Chrome	Yes. There's something I must attend to...	1																					
69	69		204							1	1																							
70	70		301								Chrome	By the way, please give this to Nanami if she comes back.	1																					
71	71		302								What is it?	72																						
72	72		301								Chrome	Kamui asked me to pass it along. It's a present he prepared for her as thanks for her April Fools treats.	1																					
73	73		302								A present...?	74																						
74	74		301									You give it a brief inspection and find it abnormally heavy for its size. You can hear the slightest sound of gears turning inside, and you reckon you know what this "present" really is.																						
75	75		302								I'll pass it along. I wanted to show my appreciation for Nanami's wasabi desert anyway.	76																						
76	76		202							1					1																			
77	77		301									Chrome departs after saying goodbye. Time passes, and finally, you see the door to the lounge open.

79	79		301							1	Nanami	H-E-L-L-O T-H-E-R-E! General Nanami's here for the afterparty!	1																					
80	80		302								You're right on time, Nanami.	81																						
81	81		301									You hand her the prepared "present."																						
82	82		301								Nanami	What is that?! Is that a gift for Nanami?!	1																					
83	83		302								Of course!	84																						
84	84		301								Nanami	Good things do come out of Nanami's good deeds!	1																					
85	85		301								Nanami	Commandant, can I open it now?	1																					
86	86		302								Sure you can! (Take a step back) (A few more) (Another one)	87																						
87	87		301								Nanami	Why are you standing so far away...?	1																					
88	88		302								Don't mind me! Open it!	89																						
89	89		301								Nanami	Right! Here I go!	1
