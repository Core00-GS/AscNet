13	13		301								Hassen	I'll leave the investigation to you.	2

62	63		301								Forest Guard A	Most of the people in the areas we searched were injured by collapsing debris or from being trampled as they tried to escape. As for the death toll...	2																					
63	64		301									The Forest Guard raises her head and gazes off at the distant horizon, seeing the snow-covered hellscape glow in the sunlight.																						
64	65		301									She remains quiet for some time, as if reluctant to speak.																						
65	66		301								Forest Guard A	I just received a list of the people who went to... the research institute. Almost all the serious injuries and dead are concentrated there.	2																					
66	67		301								Forest Guard A	As for the names on the list, none of them are included on the civilian registration form, except for a few familiar names.	2																					
67	68		301								Forest Guard A	It seems that... Before that, some... people were still buried alive with the secrets of the institute.	2																					
68	69		301									She hesitated a little when speaking. She wanted to add something worthy, but decided to force it down.																						
69	70		301								Diana	...The death toll is lower than anticipated. It's a miracle...	1																					
70	71		301								Forest Guard A	Out of all of this destruction, that's where most of the casualties are? Did she intentionally cause all of this commotion to give people time to evacuate?	2																					
71	72		301								Diana	I can't say I believe it, but I'd say so based on the death toll... Or was there some hidden motive?	1

96	102		301									Closing her eyes, it seems as if she can still hear those cries of desperation echoing in the recesses of the "Reception Hall of Peace".																						
97	103		301									The underground research lab, which had brought nightmares to Amberia and countless other people, has now been turned into ruins in a way she cannot possibly have imagined.																						
98	104		301									She lifts the collapsed stone slab, exposing the bloodstained ruins below. The mix of overlapping bright and dark reds is a silent testimony of their suffering.																						
99	105		301									Most of those who fled to the research institute knew what secret atrocities were buried here.																						
100	106		301									However, it was because of these secrets that they viewed this secret underground research lab as a safe haven.																						
101	107		301									The armor plating, execution grounds, and observation rooms built to conduct these experiments gave these people the illusion that they would never be found—much like the secrets kept within these confines.																						
102	108		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					"Sinners should be executed where they committed their crimes," Rosetta has heard. And now, seeing all these people buried in the ruins with countless test subjects, she wonders if they were indeed "sinners."

108	114		301							1	Forest Guard E	For the time being, I would classify this as C-grade damage. The destroyed houses are mainly concentrated in the area we first witnessed. Most of the buildings in other areas survived.	1

114	120		301								Watanabe	A warning? Why would she go through the additional trouble, when this was clearly her target?	1																					
115	121		301									...Maybe it was to lure those who knew about these secrets to seek shelter in the research institute.																						
116	122		301								Rosetta	Then destroy them all in one fell swoop...	2																					
117	123		301								Watanabe	What do you mean?	1
