7	7		301									Lamia lowers her hand and lies flat on the edge of the rooftop, knowing that she can try no more.																						
8	8		301								Lamia	This is bad. This is really bad. Really really bad...	1

12	12		301							1	Lamia	I can't. You aren't the one who's about to die.	1

14	14		301								???	What if I told you you don't need to die?

16	16		301									With the sound of a machine running, the speaker who has been hiding in the shadows of the rubble appears on the rooftop and sits next to Lamia.

18	18		301							1	Lamia	No way. I'm not strong enough, and it doesn't matter whether I choose to fight them head-on or run away, Gabriel and the Polyphage will still catch up to me and devour me in the end.	1

21	21		301							1	"421"	As an Ascendant... Are you really scared of death?	2																					
22	22		301								Lamia	I don't feel much, to be honest... Ascendants are usually driven by emotions stronger than their own lives, but wishes don't get fulfilled if we're dead.	1																					
23	23		301								"421"	And you do have one such wish yourself, no? One that's so strong that not even death can deter you...	2																					
24	24		301								Lamia	Maybe, but I'm not going to tell you, because you're probably just going to sell it as a piece of information.	1																					
25	25		301								Lamia	But I hate the idea of dying a meaningless death, so I'm just going to try a little harder to stay alive until...	2																					
26	26		301								Lamia	Hey! I almost fell for that... You're terrible!	1																					
27	27		301								"421"	I didn't do anything. You were the one who kept talking.	2																					
28	28		301								"421"	Back to what I was saying. If you fulfil my conditions, then I can help you walk away from Gabriel's war alive no matter who wins.	2																					
29	29		301								Lamia	Hmm... How do I know if you'll live up to your promise? We do, as a matter of fact, belong to different sides.	1																					
30	30		301								"421"	I'm a dealer, and trust is of utmost importance in a deal.	2																					
31	31		301								"421"	And you don't have a choice. Otherwise you wouldn't have come all the way to see me, no?	2																					
32	32		301								Lamia	This is super bad... Having to live under someone else's protection.	1																					
33	33		301								"421"	This isn't too different from when you first started working for Luna.	2																					
34	34		301								Lamia	Uhh? How do you know something from so long ago?	1																					
35	35		301								"421"	There is no secret here.	2																					
36	36		301								Lamia	...	1																					
37	37		301									The little robot looks away from a silent Lamia at the surging Red Tide over the horizon in the distance.																						
38	38		301								"421"	Don't sweat it. The conditions aren't overly difficult.	2																					
39	39		301								"421"	And you won't need to worry about Luna getting suspiciousâ€”if that's something you still worry about at all, that is.	2																					
40	40		301								Lamia	...Are you always this pushy with women?	1																					
41	41		301								"421"	It depends.	2																					
42	42		301								Lamia	Well then... What should I do exactly?	1																					
43	43		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				"421"	I want the "key" that can cause the lake to flood.	2
