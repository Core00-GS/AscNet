3	3		301			DialogEnable						I found myself in a strange place after entering the game. I took a few steps around, and realized this must be the spawn point of this game.																						
4	4		301									I didn't see anyone around, but Kamui mentioned we would be playing in teams.																						
5	5		301									I anxiously opened the menu and selected the Member section.																						
6	6		301								System	Character: 【kuroname】. Team members: Vera, Camu, Karenina.																						
7	7		301									I was shocked when I saw their names.																						
8	8		301									Never thought I would be forming a team with them.																						
9	2001		302								What!?	1000	Not even one Gray Raven?	1000

12	9		301							1	Karenina	What's up? You got a problem?	1																					
13	10		301									It was Karenina.																						
14	2003		201							2	500181		600																					
15	11		301							1	Vera	I didn't see this coming...	2																					
16	12		301									Vera came from the right. She was dragging her blade on the ground, making a clinking sound.																						
17	2004		201							3	500176		-600																					
18	13		301							1	Camu	You took so long.	3																					
19	14		301									Camu also jumped out from the left.																						
20	15		301									They walked to a position and stopped, then formed a regular triangle around me, still wearing their summer Coatings.																						
21	9999		301									I looked at the system notifications. These outfits seemed to be the default "hero's attire" generated by the system data.																						
22	2005		302								Did you have to rehearse for this entrance?	16	Aloha?	18																				
23	16	17	301								Karenina	What rehearsal? They were just copying me!	1																					
24	17	20	301									Still impressive though.																						
25	18	19	301								Karenina	...Did you hit your head?	1																					
26	19	20	301									I actually liked that line. Too bad she didn't.																						
27	20		301								Karenina	Enough stupid jokes. Now that the last member is here, let's hurry up and head to the castle.	1																					
28	21		301								Vera	True. Speaking of which, Karenina, you went for scouting, didn't you? Did you see any castle? We have to go there for the King, right?	2																					
29	2006		302								What castle?	22	Were you all here earlier than me?	23																				
30	22	25	301								Karenina	That's our main quest objective. This must be another of those role-playing games, where we need to take a quest from the King and defeat the Demon King.	1																					
31	23	24	301								Vera	About ten minutes. Constructs seemed to load the game faster. Now Gray Raven will probably be ahead of us.	2																					
32	24	25	301								Camu	That's why we must hurry. I don't want to lose to that fool.	3																					
33	25		301								Karenina	I went for scouting, but not for the castle.	1																					
34	26		301								Vera	What did you do then?	2																					
35	27		301								Karenina	To find the other team and kill them, of course. If we spawned nearby, they shouldn't be too far away.	1																					
36	5001		204							2	1																							
37	28		301								Vera	Wow... I didn't expect that. How did you go?	2																					
38	29		301								Karenina	Nothing, duh. I came back empty-handed. Do I have to explain everything to you?	1																					
39	30		301								Vera	No. I just want to hear you admit your failure.	2																					
40	31		301								Karenina	You red-haired ****... 	1																					
41	32		301								Camu	Stop it! Enemies have heard us!	3

50	34		301							1	Karenina	Screw the enemies. I have more important things to do now!	1																					
51	35		301								Vera	Oh can you?	2																					
52	5002		202							1	2																							
53	36		301									Seeing there was nothing he could do to stop those two, Camu let out a roar, threw his greatsword away and charged toward the enemies, while Karenina was falling for Vera's taunt.																						
54	37		301			RImgBg1Shake					Demon	Beep! Beep! Beep!																						
55	38		301									It was a complete chaos.																						
56	39		301									Only one word could describe my feeling at the moment.																						
57	40		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Hopeless.
