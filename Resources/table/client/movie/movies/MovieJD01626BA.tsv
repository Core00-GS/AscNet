7	7		302								Let's sort out all the key information first.	8																						
8	8		301								Liv	Alright, I've laid out all the known information on the Ascendants and Huaxu. I can use this database to screen for useful intel.	1

16	16		301							1	Liv	Sorry... I haven't found any clues that match the keywords...	1																					
17	17		301								Lee	Same here. However, some projections appeared when I was looking for clues regarding the farewell letter.	2																					
18	18		301								Lee	Seems like the letter has been read in full already, because I saw two people shouting for joy and heading for the location shown with the coordinates.	2																					
19	19		301								Lucia	When was this recorded?	3																					
20	20		301								Lee	The timestamp was too blurry to identify. Seems like it was a long time ago.	2																					
21	21		301								Lucia	Even after all this time, there still hasn't been any news on how to control the Punishing Virus...	3																					
22	22		301								Lucia	In other words, they may have run into danger, or it may have been completely useless information.	3																					
23	23		302								Any new clues, Lucia?	24																						
24	24		301								Lucia	I saw a large number of scavengers devoured by the Red Tide.	3																					
25	25		301								Liv	A large number of... scavengers?	1																					
26	26		301								Lucia	They seemed enthralled and willing to be engulfed by the Red Tide.	3																					
27	27		301								Lucia	I only saw this brief moment. I don't have any other information.	3																					
28	28		301								Liv	We'll keep an eye out. Let's keep going, Commandant.	1																					
29	29		301								Liv	The Corrupted up ahead are all on the right. The path on the left seems to be safer.	1
