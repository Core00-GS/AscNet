13	8		301									After the battle, Rosetta approaches the rescued ARU members, offering help.																						
14	9		301									But her extended hand is met with the same hostility as before.																						
15	1006		302								We rescued you.	10	Why are you so hostile to the Forest Guards?	11																				
16	10	1007	301								Fisher A	Y'all just repayin' yer debts.	1																					
17	11	1007	301								Fisher A	The Capt. had ye over, aye... Yeah, yeah, thanks n' all, but this's ARU matter, not yers.	1

22	13		301							1	Diana	...They should be able to get this place up and running like before in no time. But anyway, I never thought the reinforcements from Babylonia would be „Äêkuroname„Äë and you, Rosetta.	1																					
23	14		301									Confirming the safety of the surroundings, Diana approaches you. She seems relieved at seeing you once again.

26	15		301							1	Rosetta	I'm only temporarily staying at Babylonia. So if the ARU requires help, I'd naturally be the most appropriate candidate.	2																					
27	16		301								Diana	What about you, „Äêkuroname„Äë?	1																					
28	1012		302								At the behest of our dear Rosetta.	17	Thanks for your help in Kowloong.	19																				
29	17	18	301								Diana	Huh, I see... So Constructs in Babylonia get to appoint their commandants? If „Äêkuroname„Äë is on the menu, then color me intrigued.	1																					
30	18	23	301								Rosetta	This is only a temporary arrangement. „Äêkuroname„Äë is still the commandant for the Gray Ravens.	2																					
31	19	20	301								Diana	Oh... You found out? And here I was, hoping to be a hero behind the scenes.	1																					
32	20	21	301								Rosetta	Don't try something that dangerous again, Diana. Especially with my kind of luck.	2																					
33	21	22	301								Diana	Sigh, here you go with the luck stuff again, Rosetta.	1																					
34	22	23	301								Rosetta	...	2																					
35	23		301								Diana	Anyway, „Äêkuroname„Äë... Did Rosetta make you wear this?	1																					
36	1013		302								A big plump robot I am...	24	Yes.	25																				
37	24	26	301								Rosetta	It's bulky, but it has the defensive capability to match. And if you activate its built-in acceleration system, you might just be able to keep up with us for a few seconds.	1																					
38	25	26	301								Diana	That means she cares about you.	1																					
39	26		301								Diana	These Polar Soldier units just feel so nice and smooth. I've seen all sorts of piloted models, but somehow this one gives me warm and fuzzy feelings inside...	1																					
40	27		301									From gentle head-scritches of your Polar Soldier unit, Diana's hand gradually quickens into rambunctious rubbing. The paint above your head is definitely thinning.																						
41	28		301								Rosetta	Diana... Now's not the time for that. Do you have info on the current situation?	2																					
42	29		301								Diana	Yep. We received intel of the Babylonia reinforcements leaving the base and rushed over. Now, we're ready to recover the lost territory.	1																					
43	1014		302								You should be able to handle the bionics.	30	What were you guys doing before?	33																				
44	30	31	301								Diana	True, but we're shorthanded. If we want to hold a region, we'll have to station too many of our forces.	1																					
45	31	32	301								Diana	And if we don't do so, no matter how many areas we recover, they'll likely be recaptured again.	1																					
46	32	1015	301								Diana	That's why we were engaging in guerrilla warfare up until this point.	1																					
47	33	1015	301								Diana	We were conducting guerrilla warfare. The enemy has us outnumbered, so we have to resort to picking off the enemies trying to attack the main base.	1

60	38		301								Simon	Boss, I want to confirm the status on the regions recovery. We've managed to retake the resource pipeline. What about the hub facilities on your end?	1																					
61	1023		302								Done and done.	39	Are you guys okay?	40																				
62	39	42	301								Simon	I knew you'd kill it, Boss. Now, things can finally get moving.	1

69	42		301								Simon	In short, I intend to continue dispersing forces to deal with areas where the enemy's defenses are weakest. Boss, can you rendezvous with us at this position?	1

74	44		301								Simon	Yeah, a residential region. It occupies a larger area, so there are several times the bionics defending it.	1
