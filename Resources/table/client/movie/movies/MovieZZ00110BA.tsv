7	7		301							1	Nikola	You don't understand its true value.	2																					
8	8		301								Hassen	I get it. It's necessary for us to have a training mechanism for commandants on standby, but it doesn't have to be "this" one.	1																					
9	9		301								Nikola	Our understanding and awareness of "war" are weak. Even for those at F.O.S.	2																					
10	10		301								Nikola	They only wish to train a commandant's "commanding skills," not "military skills."	2																					
11	11		301								Hassen	War, huh...	1																					
12	12		301								Nikola	Most importantly, with the current team structure, the commandant's long-term partnership with Constructs creates an unnecessary emotional attachment between them.	2																					
13	13		301								Hassen	Well, isn't that a good thing? Trust between each other allows them to execute missions more effectively.	1																					
14	14		301								Nikola	Yes, it is a benefit. But it's also a recipe for disaster.	2																					
15	15		301								Nikola	Do you remember the tragedy that befell the Suzaku squad? That's the result of unnecessary emotions between a commandant and Constructs.	2																					
16	16		301								Hassen	Alright... I'll consider it.	1																					
17	17		301								Hassen	However, the security and functionality of the system must be confirmed before we can formally discuss the matter.	1																					
18	111		204							2	13																							
19	18		301								Nikola	Of course. We found the most reliable commandant to test it.	2

26	24		301								Nikola	Looks like even they don't realize the terrifying force of a commandant whose fate is interlaced with multiple powerful Constructs.	2																					
27	25		301								Nikola	They could even overthrow Babylonia if they so choose to.	2																					
28	26		301								Nikola	Indeed... This idea may not have taken root yet, but it must be nipped in the bud.	2
