28	28		301								The Dead Commandant	What is it?																						
29	29		301								Coco	I've discovered that the red tide retains the consciousness of the dead and can speak!	1																					
30	30		301								The Dead Commandant	What?!																						
31	31		301								Coco	I found the missing commandant in the red flood!	1																					
32	32		301									The four of you, as well as the three projections, all look surprised.																						
33	33		301								Coco	She kept calling my name and asking if I had seen her sister...	1																					
34	34		301								The Dead Commandant	That doesn't make any sense! What do you think it is? The River Styx of Hades?																						
35	35		201							1	500019																							
36	36		301							1	Rowler	Bahahaha, I didn't think you were gone all this time because you were out daydreaming!	1

38	38		301									Their tease causes Coco to tremble slightly with anger. She stops smiling and bites her lip. The commandant realizes their rude behavior and sighs, motioning Coco to continue.																						
39	39		201							1	500257																							
40	40		301							1	Coco	Not only did I find out about the missing commandant... I uncovered two other commonalities after I went asking around the other scavengers.	1																					
41	41		301									Coco maintains her polite smile, but her voice has a solemn undertone.																						
42	42		301								Coco	First off, the voices they've heard also come from those who died in the red tide, which is different from the River Styx. It's not like you can hear everyone who has ever died...	1																					
43	43		301									The commandant nods. She relaxes a bit, then swipes the screen with her fingertip to show a video to the other three.																						
44	44		301								Coco	I'm not sure if the red liquid has to be the direct cause of death, or if it applies to all those that get swallowed up after death.	1																					
45	45		301								Coco	I didn't see how the commandant died. I just found some of the things she left behind near the tide.	1																					
46	46		301								Coco	Even though I could hear her, I could only distinguish a few vague sentences. It's impossible to judge whether the red liquid retains her consciousness or is just imitating her.	1																					
47	47		301								Coco	The second thing is, the scavengers said they could hear her voice too.	1																					
48	48		301								The Dead Commandant	In other words, this is a phenomenon that anyone can observe. It's not like other paranormal folklore...																						
49	49		301								Coco	But her voice only appeared when I got close to the tide. Kind of like how no one would greet a stranger in a distant crowd.	1																					
50	50		201							1	500019																							
51	51		301							1	Rowler	Whaddaya mean? I would if they're good lookin'!	1

81	81		301								Lucia	Based on the clues we just obtained, I'd be willing to bet.	3																					
82	82		301								Lucia	With the Red Tide as big as it is now, there's sure to be a lot more remains in it.	3																					
83	83		301								Lucia	But why were there so many people and Corrupted stationed in this area?	3																					
84	84		301								Lee	Maybe they weren't stationed here but gathered here.	1																					
85	85		301								Lucia	Gathered here? You mean the Red Tide lured them here?	3

101	102		502							RImgBg1Shake																								
102	103		301									Just as the commandant gives the order, the Ascendant throws the human against the ceiling, and the commandant's neck snaps from the impact, quietly falling to the other side of the room.

118	119		301								Lamia	Missing something?																						
119	120		301								Coco	How did you come out of... Wait, how can a Corrupted like you talk?

121	122		301								Coco	Who the hell are you?!																						
122	123		301								Lamia	That doesn't concern you. Since you were investigating under the Ascendants' watchful eyes, you can't walk out of here alive.																						
123	124		301								Coco	What's an Ascendant? What do you mean by their watchful eyes? Did you create the tide?																						
124	125		301								Lamia	Quit asking so many questions. I can't answer them all at once.																						
125	126		301								Lamia	But one thing is certain. This is providence. So, the world cannot find out yet.																						
126	127		301									With that, you hear the sound of an explosion. Coco screams as the stairs collapse.																						
127	128		301								Lamia	I accidentally said too much, but it doesn't matter. She's already dead.																						
128	129		301									Lamia sighs and jumps down from the second floor, her scowling fading into the distance.																						
129	130		301								Lamia	How troublesome. Now I have to chase the other guy who ran away, but I'm sure he hasn't gotten far with that injury.

149	150		302								Lose us "too"?	151																						
150	151		301								Bridget	Yeah. We've already lost contact with a lot of teams due to the poor signal, or because of that red liquid.	1

154	155		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Bridget	The Red Tide, eh?	1																					
155	156		301								Bridget	It's just like you said. Huaxu most likely let Gestalt discover these coordinates.	1																					
156	157		301								Bridget	Since the Ascendants want to use the Red Tide, their base must be nearby. We need to give this target higher priority!	1																					
157	158		301								Bridget	What's wrong? Worried that changing your objective will cause issues?	1																					
158	159		302								No. I also think tracking them should be our priority.	160																						
159	160		301								Bridget	Agreed. I'll report the new target to the higher-ups. Hopefully, they'll dispatch more people.	1																					
160	161		301								Bridget	But, as you know, with the signal as bad as it is here, it's probably going to be sunset when we hear back.	1																					
161	162		301								Bridget	Continue with your mission! Based on what the others have said, Huaxu is most likely at the Ascendants' base.	1

168	169		302								That would be great.	170																						
169	170		301								Bridget	Alright, I'll dispatch a ship to get you. Wait by the hotel window, like Cinderella's carriage waiting for her at midnight!	1																					
170	171		302								What's the situation with Babylonia?	172																						
171	172		301								Bridget	We haven't received any good news. But, at least we haven't heard anything worse.	1																					
172	173		301								Bridget	Seems like it's still roughly at the same altitude as when you first left. It's rising slowly, but it can't accelerate for a while. Which means that it's still in danger of being targeted from the surface.	1																					
173	174		302								How about the others?	175																						
174	175		301								Bridget	As you know, most of the crew has descended along with you. Those that remained onboard are scrambling to clean up.	1																					
175	176		301								Bridget	Regardless, this has been a slap in the face for some people.	1																					
176	177		302								Some people?	178																						
177	178		301								Bridget	Those who got a little too complacent hiding in Babylonia.	1																					
178	179		301								Bridget	As long as matters on Earth aren't resolved, I won't be surprised if this happens again. And no one can guarantee that we will be so successful next time.	1
