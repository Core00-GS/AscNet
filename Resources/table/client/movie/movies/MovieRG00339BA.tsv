9	9		301									The Demon King "Celica" stood right in front of us. She turned over and greeted us like friends.

11	11		301							1	Liv	Could you tell us why we have to fight?	1																					
12	12		201							1	500001																							
13	13		301							1	Demon King	Because the Demon King must be defeated by heroes. Only by doing so can you bring peace to the world.	1																					
14	14		302								We have already defeated the King. Is that not enough?	15	We can have world peace if you stop what you are doing.	16																				
15	15	17	301								Demon King	Of course not. He was only a system bug, not a condition for world peace.	1																					
16	16		301								Demon King	More Kings like him would be created if I stop now.	1																					
17	17		301								Demon King	This game world was originally set in the way that, peace would be restored once the heroes had defeated the Demon King.	1																					
18	18		301								Demon King	In the last run, the heroes didn't complete their quest but ended the game abruptly, causing the world to crash.	1																					
19	19		301								Demon King	I didn't want to continue hurting others, so a system error occurred, creating a King who replaced my position.	1

21	21		301							1	Karenina	Were you part of the reason why that King turned evil?	1																					
22	22		201							1	500001																							
23	23		301							1	Demon King	Yes. That's why I wanted to stop his plan myself.	1																					
24	24		301								Demon King	Unless you destroy me completely, this game will never end properly and it's a matter of time before the next King shows up.	1

28	28		301							1	Demon King	You're exactly right, Holy Maiden.	1																					
29	29		301									After the farewell message, the Demon King was engulfed in darkness, until an alien-like creature crawled out.
