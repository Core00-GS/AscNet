4	4		301							1	Doctor	President Hassen, she was unconscious in a pool of blood when we found her. Most of her sensory modules had been cut off, resulting in her not noticing the severe damages on her body.	1																					
5	5		301								Doctor	Or should I say... she noticed but didn't care anymore.	1																					
6	6		201							1	500011																							
7	7		301							1	Hassen	How is she now?	1																					
8	8		201							1	500042																							
9	9		301							1	Doctor	We performed emergency maintenance on her frame. She's already awake.	1																					
10	10		201							1	500011																							
11	11		301							1	Hassen	Thank goodness.	1																					
12	12		201							1	500042																							
13	13		301							1	Doctor	Also, we recommend switching frames for her, the longer it's delayed, the more her personality will deviate.	1																					
14	14		201							1	500011																							
15	15		301							1	Hassen	...I understand. Take me to her.	1																					
16	16		201							1	500042																							
17	17		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Doctor	Of course, please follow me.	1

20	20		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Hassen follows the doctor past layers and layers of security before reaching the ICU ward. He enters the room after three light knocks on the door.																						
21	21		201							1	500011																							
22	22		301							1	Hassen	It's been four days since we found you. I'm glad you're awake now.	1																					
23	23		201							1	500128																							
24	24		301							1	Bianca	I... There's nothing for you to be glad about... You should've left me to die back on the roof.	1																					
25	25		201							1	500011																							
26	26		301							1	Hassen	...I'm sorry for everything that has happened, but they didn't happen all for nothing. You don't need to reject yourself like that.	1																					
27	27		201							1	500128																							
28	28		301							1	Bianca	...	1																					
29	29		201							1	500011																							
30	30		301							1	Hassen	Oh, where are my manners? I'm Hassen, the leader of Humanity.	1																					
31	31		301								Hassen	Firstly, I would like to thank you on behalf of all humanity for destroying Daedalus.	1																					
32	32		201							1	500128																							
33	33		301							1	Bianca	I didn't do anything special. It was just senseless killing...	1																					
34	34		201							1	500011																							
35	35		301							1	Hassen	No, what you did was taking out Kurono's traitorâ€”Wen.	1																					
36	36		301								Hassen	If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have been able to track him down and Daedalus' network wouldn't have been destroyed.	1																					
37	37		301								Hassen	And because of you, that bastard got what he deserved.	1																					
38	38		301								Hassen	You did the right thing, no matter in the snow plains, the church, or to Wen's underlings. Your actions have undoubtedly saved many. It's just that your faith may have been used by people with ulterior motives.	1																					
39	39		201							1	500128

42	42		301									Hassen pulls over the monitor by the hospital bed and taps on it a few times. Holograms of different cities are projected into the air, with all kinds of numbers flashing above.																						
43	43		201							1	500011																							
44	44		301							1	Hassen	Look at these. These are the cities you've been to. If it weren't for your timely elimination of the Corrupted, the population of these cities would've dropped drastically, and eventually leading to their fall.	1																					
45	45		202							1					1																			
46	46		301									The models of the cities morph and crumble as Hassen spoke, turning into a pile of ruins in the end.																						
47	47		201							1	500128																							
48	48		301							1	Bianca	Really...?	1																					
49	49		201							1	500011																							
50	50		301							1	Hassen	Yes, you saved them from destruction.	1																					
51	51		201							1	500128																							
52	52		301							1	Bianca	...	1																					
53	53		201							1	500011																							
54	54		301							1	Hassen	Sometimes, people like you are needed. Shooting a soundless arrow in the dark and not in the light, misunderstood and even detested.	1																					
55	55		301								Hassen	But this is the only way to ensure the sun can rise once more and that the world can be protected.	1																					
56	56		201							1	500128																							
57	57		301							1	Bianca	...	1																					
58	58		201							1	500011

61	61		301									Hassen taps on the screen and a flat area is shown.																						
62	62		201							1	500128																							
63	63		301							1	Bianca	That's!	1																					
64	64		201							1	500011																							
65	65		301							1	Hassen	Yep, where Daedalus once stood. It's completely gone now, as if it never existed in the first place.	1																					
66	66		301								Hassen	People are still living the same peaceful lives, but now the threat has been completely eliminated.	1																					
67	67		201							1	500128																							
68	68		301							1	Bianca	You did this?	1																					
69	69		201							1	500011																							
70	70		301							1	Hassen	Yes, more specifically, the Purifying Force of Humanity did.	1																					
71	71		301								Hassen	You had no direct contact with them but your motives were the same in this event.	1																					
72	72		301								Hassen	You stopped Daedalus together.	1																					
73	73		201							1	500128																							
74	74		301							1	Bianca	...	1																					
75	75		201							1	500011																							
76	76		301							1	Hassen	I think you'd fit right in, Miss Bianca. So I'd like to ask you on behalf of Humanity, will you join the Purifying Force?	1																					
77	77		201							1	500128																							
78	78		301							1	Bianca	I...	1																					
79	79		201							1	500011																							
80	80		301							1	Hassen	Take some time to think about it, kid.	1																					
81	81		201							1	500128																							
82	82		301							1	Bianca	...	1																					
83	83		201							1	500011																							
84	84		301							1	Hassen	I've faced many dead ends too when I was your age, but we can't always let the past stop us.	1																					
85	85		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Hassen	Rest for now, we'll meet again soon.	1
