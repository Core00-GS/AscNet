5	5		301									Walking through the bustling market, Lucia carefully observes her surroundings.																						
6	6		301									Aside from vendors selling goods, the organizers have also arranged a variety of activities during the celebration to earn tons of Star Tickets.																						
7	7		301									That is Lucia's goal.																						
8	8		204							1	4																							
9	9		301									Like using her skills with a bow to earn the highest score in "Whac-a-Mole".																						
10	19		301									Or using her impeccable hand-eye coordination to get first place in "Kendama".																						
11	29		301									Now, Lucia is about to register for "Double Trouble".																						
12	30		302								...	31																						
13	31		301									Looks like you were right to quietly follow Lucia over here. Seems like collecting Star Tickets is her top priority.

16	34		301								Lucia	Weren't you going to take a break in the exhibition hall, Commandant?	1																					
17	35		302								I was worried about you.		I needed some fresh air.	40																				
18	36		201							1	500151																							
19	37		301								Lucia	Worried? It's safe here. There isn't any potential danger.	1																					
20	38		302								That's not what I mean...	39																						
21	39	41	301									I've been worried you're taking this too seriously and not enjoying the celebration. It's better that you take the time to relax...																						
22	40		301									Rather than telling Lucia that you're worried about taking the competition too seriously and not enjoying the celebration, you decide to guide her into a more positive mindset...																						
23	41		302								And I wanted to walk around the market with you, Lucia.	42																						
24	42		201							1	500151

30	48		301			DialogEnable						Compared with the exhibition hall, which is mostly children, the market is filled with couples.																						
31	49		301									The stalls sell a variety of goods, such as crude paper and plastic knickknacks or plants in bottles. Even still, everyone is carefully looking through their wares, asking each other's opinions, or playfully teasing each other.																						
32	50		301									Hearing these lovers quarrels throughout the market, you can't help but cast sideways glances and smile.																						
33	51		301									Along the way, you and Lucia also attract your fair share of attention. Some people are drawn to Lucia's distinct coating, while others...

35	53		301								Pedestrian A	Look! She's the one that can 1000 points in "Whac-a-Mole"...

51	69		301								Lucia	Commandant?	1																					
52	70		301									Lucia refrains from answering. Instead, she glances over questioningly as if to let you decide.																						
53	71		302								What for?	72																						
54	72		302								Can I see some credentials?	73																						
55	73		301									Since Lucia is letting you decide, you feel it is necessary for the other party to confirm his identity and the purpose of the photo to protect your team member.																						
56	74		301								Staff Member	The photo will be put on the memorial wall for the celebration. With your consent, of course, my lady.	2																					
57	75		301									The man takes out his terminal and shows Lucia the wall with numerous photos of the celebration.																						
58	76		301									Whether it's a picture of a vendor proudly displaying his own craft, a child making silly faces, or a shy but happy couple—all sorts of pictures are on the memorial wall.																						
59	77		301								Staff Member	As for my credentials...	2																					
60	78		301									He begrudgingly opens up the work permit folder on his terminal.																						
61	79		302								?	80																						
62	80		301									You look down and confirm that his employee code is indeed authentic and he is, in fact, a staff member working for the celebration.																						
63	81		301									Written as his name, you see...																						
64	82		302								Cupid...	83																						
65	83		302								Ahem...																							
66	84		301								Cupid	Alright, enough already. No one can help what their parents name them, right?	2																					
67	85		301									He has a look of "I knew you'd laugh" on his face.																						
68	86		302								Lucia...	87																						
69	87		302								Let's take a picture so we have something to remember about the celebration.	88

76	94		301									Lucia walks in front of the camera and strikes her usual pose.	1																					
77	95		301								Cupid	You're gorgeous, but you're a little stiff. Think you can loosen up a bit?																						
78	96		301								Lucia	Loosen up...	1

80	98		301							1		Lucia slightly adjusts her posture.	1																					
81	99		301								Cupid	Better, but a little happier. Maybe give the camera a wink?																						
82	100		301								Lucia	A wink...?	1																					
83	101		302								You know... Like this...	102																						
84	102		301									Cupid gives her a demonstration.

103	121		302								Works for me.	122																						
104	122		301								Cupid	As a thank you, everyone photographed gets a printed photo. Would you like one? I'll have one for you in a jiffy. The camera comes with a printer.	2																					
105	123		301									He pats the latch on the bottom of his camera.

109	127		301								Lucia	I don't need you to print this photo, but can you take a photo of me and the commandant?	1																					
110	128		301								Cupid	Of course!	2																					
111	129		302								Huh?	130																						
112	130		301									You're slightly caught off guard. Lucia rarely asks anything of others.																						
113	131		301								Lucia	Didn't you say you wanted a picture to commemorate the celebration?	1																					
114	132		301								Lucia	I think a photo of us would be more memorable.	1																					
115	133		302								Makes sense.	134																						
116	134		301								Lucia	Too bad Liv and Lee aren't here.	1																					
117	135		302								Let's take another photo of the four of us before we leave.	136																						
118	136		302								But for now, we'll take this one.	137																						
119	137		301								Lucia	Okay.	1																					
120	138		301								Cupid	Now that it's decided... How about we take a photo over there?	2
