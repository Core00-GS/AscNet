6	6		301								Lee	Commandant takes one, and the other one stays with Lucia or myself.	1																					
7	7		301								Kamui	Wait, what about me and Karenina?	2																					
8	8		301								Lee	You two can't keep anything valuable. Just think of your fighting style.	1																					
9	9		301								Kamui	Hmm... Lucia keeps it then.	2

12	12		301							1	Demon King	Wait, did you say you have two artifact fragments?	1																					
13	13		201							1	500173																							
14	14		301							1	Lee	Yeah, why?	1																					
15	15		201							1	500113																							
16	16		301							1	Demon King	Something's not right... The other two heroes said they had three...	1																					
17	17		201							1	500180																							
18	18		301							1	Karenina	Three... Huh?	1																					
19	19		302								Were there five artifact fragments?	20	Where does the extra one come from?	22																				
20	20		201							1	500113																							
21	21	24	301							1	Demon King	There have always been only four pieces. What's going on here...	1																					
22	22		201							1	500113																							
23	23		301							1	Demon King	I also wanted to ask. As far as I know, there are only four pieces.	1																					
24	24		201							1	500173																							
25	25		301							1	Lee	If the Demon King's right, the simplest answer is one of the five fragments is a counterfeit.	1																					
26	26		201							1	1081001	2																						
27	27		301							1	Kamui	Oh, another classic plot. Now we just have to find out which one is fake!	1																					
28	28		201							1	500173																							
29	29		301							1	Lee	Fake... One of ours was retrieved directly from a Demon General. But the other wasn't...	1																					
30	30		301								Lee	Commandant, Karenina, Camu gave you the fragment you brought here, didn't he? Could it be possibly swapped?	1																					
31	31		302								Maybe.	32	I don't see why Camu would do this.	33																				
32	32	34	301								Lee	Maybe... We can't make any conclusion from "maybe."	1																					
33	33		301								Lee	True. He could have kept the artifact, and no one would have any question.	1																					
34	34		201							1	500180																							
35	35		301							1	Karenina	...	1																					
36	36		201							1	500173																							
37	37		301							1	Lee	Um, you've been really quiet. Have you thought of something?	1

44	44		301								Karenina	„Äêkuroname„Äë, do you remember what Vera and Camu said? Now I finally understand.	1																					
45	45		301									Karenina clenched her fist. She looked infuriated.																						
46	46		301								Karenina	They have the counterfeit. We need to get the real one there. Let's go.	1																					
47	47		302								What's going on?	48	Yeah, let's go.	49																				
48	48	50	301								Karenina	Just come, you fool! They'll get suspicious if we waste too much time!	1																					
49	49		301								Karenina	Hmph, you are not that stupid.	1
