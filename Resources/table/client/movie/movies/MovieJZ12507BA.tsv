4	4		301									She has been walking for a very long time, uncertain where to go.																						
5	5		301									But when she reaches this place, she feels like she should stay here for a while.																						
6	6		301									She walks past ruin after ruin, tallying the patterns and marks she can barely recognize. She even sees a hideous plate that says "Evacuation Site 184â€”Acadia Evacuation".																						
7	7		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Walking along the ruins, she finds an underground theater. Its spacious hall and the dilapidated interior tell the story of the theater's past grandeur.

11	11		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		There is no music in this place, only two dying figures. One of them is quite young, the other fairly senior.																						
12	12		301									The girl is clearly sick, her hasty breathing seemingly blowing away what little life she has left.																						
13	13		301									The old soldier leans on the crumbling backdrop, his injuries suggesting that he was in an intense battle. The red lights from his wounds are particularly blinding.																						
14	14		301									They seem to be infected with some virus. She should remember the name, but she cannot.																						
15	15		301								Soldier	Aargh... C-calling conservation area 184... I've found the missing kid...	1																					
16	16		301								Soldier	I was attacked by Corrupted during the mission... I'm damaged beyond the threshold... Please send reinforcement...	1

20	20		301									Not here. Somewhere far away, where a young girl cried in the same way.																						
21	21		301									She does not want to hear that cry anymore.																						
22	22		301									She steps forward, hoping to assist the two figures.																						
23	23		301									But as she approaches them, the girl's breathing gets faster, and the limping body of the soldier tenses up.																						
24	24		301									Did... she do that? Hesitant, she stops. She dares not to get closer, seeing how their conditions worsen.																						
25	25		301									Suddenly, the soldier raises a hand, seemingly trying to get up. His damaged frame gives in soon, however, falling forward after moving a few inches. But she finds his trembling finger pointing toward her.																						
26	26		301									She looks down and sees a device.																						
27	27		204							1	3																							
28	28		301									The gap in her mind seems to be filled up perfectly by the shape of this device.																						
29	29		301									It is a transmitter, she realizes.																						
30	30		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She turns on the device that the soldier cannot reach. After a brief pause, she decides to input the soldier's cry from earlier as well. Then she leaves before her memory returns to her like a deadly tempest.

34	34		301									She keeps walking forward.																						
35	35		301									She has been walking for a very long time, uncertain where to go.																						
36	36		301									She seems to be traveling in a universe. Not that she remembers what a universe is exactly, but she can feel the boundless space when she thinks of that word.																						
37	37		301									Then, she stops.																						
38	38		301									Light purple petals enter her view, spreading all over the field.																						
39	39		301									As if the boundless universe suddenly opens a purple eye, she is drawn by a tender but unwavering gravity.																						
40	40		301									She reaches the eye. She can hear the rustling of the flowers by her feet. For a moment, she is surrounded by the gravity of love, and the empty void of space leaves her in an instant.																						
41	41		301									Then she hears a call. She turns around.

44	44		301									The stars that have watched this planet for millennia turn to watch her.																						
45	45		301									She feels dizzy and dazed in their gazes.																						
46	46		301									But she does not stop looking.																						
47	47		301									She watches them one by one, going over one eye after another. At last, she stops on one of them.																						
48	48		301									She can see it blinking. It seems to be singing to her.																						
49	49		301									She feels compelled to respond.																						
50	50		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					So she sings, quietly, to the star.
