7	7		301									Walking down the same passageway you've taken only too many times, you reach that certain office you can't be more familiar with before you know it. Right before you press the doorbell, however, you hear a weighty voice coming from inside the room.

15	15		301								Instructor	I wanted to talk about your plan after graduation.	1														100000429							
16	16		301									He says without a moment's hesitation.																						
17	17		301								Instructor	I'm not going to stick my nose into your business, but I need to know your reasoning behind your decision as your instructor.	1														100000430							
18	18		301								Instructor	Why did you turn down Command Central's invitation and apply to be a frontline commandant at the Task Force?	1														100000431							
19	19		301									The shrewd eyes staring right at you now are the same eyes that have been watching every single student since you entered the school.																						
20	20		301									You sense neither encouragement nor discontent from his tone—but solemness and gravity.																						
21	21		301									There is no doubt that those eyes will see right through any petty lies and excuses you come up with.

33	33		301									The screen on the table shows a report in the making. The first half of it seems normal enough, but the second half is littered with strings of garbled letters and symbols—a telltale sign that whoever was typing landed on the keyboard with their face.																						
34	34		302								...	35																						
35	35		301									Rubbing your slightly numb face, you return your gaze to Liv.																						
36	36		301								Liv	What are you doing sleeping here, Commandant? A little too tired, I guess?	1														100000442							
37	37		302								Don't worry. I was just taking a nap.	38

39	39		301								Liv	...	1														100000443							
40	40		301									None of the words put Liv's mind at ease. You put up your hands in defeat seeing Liv all concerned about you.																						
41	41		302								And I thought I'd have a few check-ups done, too.	42																						
42	42		302								Liv, can I ask you to do me a favor?	43																						
43	43		204							1	1																							
44	44		301								Liv	Shift your head backward a little and remember to relax.	1														100000444							
45	45		301									Completing the check-up in a breeze, Liv lets out a sigh of relief.																						
46	46		302								Is everything good?	47	How long do I have, Doc?	49																				
47	47		301								Liv	Everything is good, but I'd still suggest you go to bed earlier, Commandant.	1														100000445							
48	48	51	301									Liv nods at you.																						
49	49		301								Liv	It depends on how you manage your health, Commandant. Going to sleep now, for example, will be mighty helpful.	1														100000446							
50	50		301									Liv says with a smile.																						
51	51		302								But I've still got work to do.	52																						
52	52		301								Liv	Well, let me help you with the paperwork, then. You can go to sleep earlier if we finish everything ahead of time.	1														100000447							
53	53		302								Now, your M.I.N.D. rehab session for the day...	54																						
54	54		301								Liv	Is completed.	1														100000448							
55	55		204							1	2																							
56	56		301								Liv	You weren't late for today's rehab session, right?	1														100000449							
57	57		302								Of course not!	58																						
58	58		301									With it, both you and Liv break into a wry smile—for the time being, neither of you is in any condition to fight, what with the degeneration of your muscles and the occasional migraines occurring in Liv's M.I.N.D.																						
59	59		301									With the help of an exoskeleton, you've taken part in a few non-combat assignments, except such assignments don't come by every day.																						
60	60		301									And an exoskeleton is but a short-term solution in the broader picture of making a full recovery.																						
61	61		301									The war has turned white-hot, and you know for a fact that Lucia and Lee are far too competent and they can't stay in Babylonia with Liv and you.																						
62	62		301									You want to be at the frontline fighting with the team—but decided to stay behind to perform desk work while rehabilitating instead, after being convinced by them.																						
63	63		204							1	19																							
64	64		301								Liv	I wonder what happened to Lee and Lucia, though...	1														100000450							
65	65		301									To cause no hiccups to the war, Lee and Lucia always make it a point to only contact you when they're back at their base for maintenance. According to them, they've seen small-scale victories in their combat zone.																						
66	66		302								We just have to trust them.	67																						
67	67		302								And we need to try our best in what we can do.	68																						
68	68		204							1	1																							
69	69		301								Liv	Yes!	1														100000451							
70	70		301									Having worked off the negative vibes, you find yourself concentrating once again on the report. Then, as you go ahead to delete the string of garbled letters and symbols with the delete key, you reach out for the coffee cup sitting right next to you...																						
71	71		204							1	6																							
72	72		301									Yet, much to your surprise, you touch a warm, soft hand instead of a coffee cup...																						
73	73		204							1	1																							
74	74		301								Liv	How about something else for a change, Commandant?	1														100000452							
75	75		301									Liv passes you a different cup. Giving off white steam, the cup has amber-colored tea sitting in it instead.																						
76	76		302								What's this...?	77																						
77	77		301								Liv	This is a decaffeinated herbal tea. You should refrain from consuming any more caffeine for the day, given that you've already consumed 180mg.	1														100000453							
78	78		301									Liv explains in a serious tone. Probably best to listen to the expert here since she's the one taking care of the team's health.																						
79	79		301									Taking a sip of the tea, you can taste the warm fragrance of the liquid making its way down your throat before it reaches your chest and blossoms, instantly easing you of most of the pent-up fatigue from work.																						
80	80		301									Liv, on the other hand, has taken a seat across from you and begun sorting through the remaining reports.																						
81	81		301									The faintly glowing screen, the sound of keystrokes, the fragrance of the tea, and a Liv working away at the reports—the room is quiet and peaceful, seemingly having nothing save for these left in it.																						
82	82		301									It's been so long since you last felt the same ease of mind...																						
83	83		301								Liv	I need you to go over some parts of this report, Commandant.	1														100000454

89	89		301									You go over the report before signing your ID number on it. The whole process of sorting through the documents was supposed to take you through the entire afternoon—yet here you are, having reached the end of it in under two hours with the two of you working on it.																						
90	90		302								Boy, that was fast.	91																						
91	91		301									Pouring tea into the now empty cup, Liv appears out of it as she keeps her eyes fixated on the global warfare map.																						
92	92		302								What are you looking for?	93																						
93	93		301								Liv	I'm trying to pinpoint Lucia and Lee...	1														100000456							
94	94		204							1	19																							
95	95		301								Liv	I mean, because I missed their call from last night.	1														100000457							
96	96		302								It's not your fault, though.	97																						
97	97		301									An episode of migraine hit Liv out of the blue right before Lucia and Lee dialed in last night, plunging her M.I.N.D.—which hasn't even made a full recovery yet—into an extremely unstable state.																						
98	98		301									After stabilizing her condition with the cable you carried and a Deep M.I.N.D. connection you managed to establish before things went out of hand, you put on your exoskeleton and ran up to the Star of Life with Liv in your arms.																						
99	99		301									Liv was still under treatment when Lucia and Lee dialed in.																						
100	100		204							1																								
101	101		302								Based on where they were calling from last night...	102																						
102	102		301									Staff list, resource provision, and engagement status—all the information about a certain base pops up when you put your finger on it.																						
103	103		302								They should be here.	104																						
104	104		301									Lucia' and Lee's names are on the staff list—with two short lines preceding their names, respectively.																						
105	105		204							1	19																							
106	106		301									Frame Damage: 15.32%																						
107	107		301									Infection: 0.00%																						
108	108		301									Based on their battle report, the two seemed to have found a branch of the Red Tide on their own without the warning of a Support-type Construct.																						
109	109		301									They put indicating beacons in place during their battle with Hetero-Creatures. While the beacons had only a minimal effect in guiding the garrison at the base, they managed to sever the branch with their accurate attacks all the same.																						
110	110		301								Liv	If only I were there, too...	1														100000458							
111	111		301									Liv keeps her eyes fixated on the very first line of the report. It briefly mentions the resources the base needs more of, with a special note stating that all squads are in need of help from Support-type Constructs.																						
112	112		302								I am sure you'll be able to get back there in no time.	113																						
113	113		204							1																								
114	114		301								Liv	And that's if they manage to improve remote Deep M.I.N.D. connection, right?	1														100000459							
115	115		301									The Deep M.I.N.D. connection helps to stabilize the migraine coming from Liv's M.I.N.D., and Asimov is working with the rest of his team to figure out a way to establish the connection remotely without a cable.																						
116	116		302								Asimov said we'll be giving it a try soon, right?	117																						
117	117		301									Gray Raven will be back on the road whole as soon as we have that technical barrier taken care of.																						
118	118		301									Nodding her head, however, Liv suddenly looks troubled with what seems to be an abrupt thought.																						
119	119		204							1	2																							
120	120		301								Liv	By the way, Commandant, I understand that Professor Hippocrates asked you to exercise your body, but I'd still suggest that you steer clear of ground missions before you make a full recovery.	1														100000460							
121	121		302								It's force majeure.	122	I'll try to...	122																				
122	122		301									Liv's eyebrows frown slightly at your reply.																						
123	123		301									But lucky for you, Liv raises another question, letting go of the subject.																						
124	124		204							1	1																							
125	125		301								Liv	What are we going to do now, though...	1														100000461							
126	126		302								About that...	127																						
127	127		301									Liv means well, but it's no doubt much too early for you to hit the hay now.																						
128	128		301									You finished your rehab session for the day in the morning, but you have to make an appointment a day in advance if you want to get to your next session.																						
129	129		302								Uhm...	130																						
130	130		301									You have no idea what to do.																						
131	131		302								I don't know, Liv. Got any plans?	132																						
132	132		204							1	7																							
133	133		301								Liv	Wait, are you asking me?	1														100000462

138	138		204							1

147	147		302								Oh?	148																						
148	148		301								Asimov	I can't get into the details on the line, but I'll fill you in on the situation when you're here. Remember to bring Liv with you.	2														100000411

213	213		302								Of course.	214																						
214	214		301									After bringing Liv to safety, you filled them in on what you'd gone through, missing not so much as the most minute of details, with the hope that they'd turn out helpful with repairing Liv's M.I.N.D.

218	218		301								Asimov	Spot on. The signal is negligibly weak, but it is part of Liv.	2														100000417							
219	219		301								Asimov	We took a look at the data sent back by the probe. The bands seem very special, and I'd describe them as...	2														100000418							
220	220		301									Asimov is trying to come up with a more appropriate, layman-friendly word.																						
221	221		301								Hippocrates	I'll take over from here.	1														100000834							
222	222		301								Hippocrates	Here is an example. Do you remember how many people you passed by in the rehab center yesterday?	1														100000835							
223	223		302								I'd be damned if I did...	224	Might as well ask me how many rolls of bread I've ever had.	225																				
224	224	229	301								Hippocrates	Correct. See, no one ever remembers how much bread they ate.	1														100000836							
225	225		204							1	5																							
226	226		301								Hippocrates	And I take it that you recall how much bread you ate? Now, that's definitely worth looking into.	1														100000837							
227	227		302								I... would be damned if I did.	228																						
228	228		204							1																								
229	229		301								Hippocrates	People don't remember all the information that goes through the brain.	1														100000838							
230	230		301								Hippocrates	We might experience certain things or think about them, but they don't become lasting memories in our brains.	1														100000839							
231	231		301								Asimov	It's exactly like what the Professor said, and this particular set of data is showing us the same thing—they are the parts that Liv's mind "ignored," "forgotten," or, if you will, "rejected."	2														100000419							
232	232		301								Asimov	Based on our analysis of the signal waveform sent back to us, we were able to more or less pinpoint the location of this M.I.N.D. shard that's projecting this forest.	2														100000420							
233	233		301									Asimov enlarges the window—to the extent that it almost takes up the entire screen.																						
234	234		301									Right in the center of the screen now stands the silhouette of a spire—with scarlet plants running along its length.																						
235	235		302								It's the Punishing Virus...	236																						
236	236		301								Asimov	It's only lightly infected, but it doesn't mean we can just ignore it.	2														100000421							
237	237		301								Asimov	Which is why we need you to clean up the contamination—in addition to looking into it.	2														100000422

241	241		301							1		Worried, you turn to look at Liv—who you know shouldn't be risking herself over a mission like this with her M.I.N.D. still making a recovery.

247	247		301								Hippocrates	We have an ample amount of time to get ourselves ready, unlike last time.	1														100000841							
248	248		301								Hippocrates	Asimov came up with a "safety trigger" program.	1														100000842							
249	249		301								Hippocrates	And what it does is that if and when things get out of hand, the "trigger" will activate and force you to wake up.	1														100000843							
250	250		301								Hippocrates	And feel free to pull the "trigger" yourself if the situation becomes such that doesn't allow you to continue probing.	1														100000844							
251	251		301								Hippocrates	It won't hurt your M.I.N.D., but we'll have no choice but to give up on this particular shard.	1														100000845							
252	252		302								Why does it have to be Liv, though?	253																						
253	253		301								Hippocrates	I decided to ask you and Liv for help for another reason. See, this shard and the subconscious mind are similar in that they're both what make up the bottom layer of the M.I.N.D.	1														100000846							
254	254		301								Hippocrates	And the feedback of both of your activities there will go a long way toward improving the Deep M.I.N.D. connection. You just don't get samples of this kind of M.I.N.D. every day.	1														100000847							
255	255		301									Finishing her sentence, Hippocrates' face turns uneasy.																						
256	256		204							1	14																							
257	257		301								Hippocrates	Although I wouldn't want to go through all of it again to get another sample...	1														100000848

263	263		301								Hippocrates	Yes?	1														100000849							
264	264		301								Liv	How am I supposed to get inside my own M.I.N.D. shard with Commandant?	2														100000470							
265	265		204							1	1																							
266	266		301								Hippocrates	Asimov wrote you a program that will help you do just that. He'll take you through some fine-tuning first, though.	1														100000850							
267	267		301								Hippocrates	Your commandant, on the other hand, will get in there when you're done fine-tuning.	1														100000851

283	283		301								Hippocrates	I mean, to a certain degree, this whole thing is just like "really getting to know yourself."	1														100000854

435	435		301									The path through the forest isn't exactly trekker-friendly—while your shoes with the extra-thick soles are keeping your feet well-protected from all the sharp stones on the ground, you still need to be absolutely careful so as not to slip off the moss.																						
436	436		301									The trees, the grass, and the flowers—everything around you is of the same color...																						
437	437		301									The forest has not a single trace of humans, and the cries of the insects seem to come from afar.																						
438	438		301									Completely lost, you stay closely behind Liv.																						
439	439		301									And suddenly, Liv stops in her tracks.																						
440	440		201							1	500524	7																						
441	441		301							1	Liv	Hey?	1														100000496							
442	442		302								What's the matter?	443																						
443	443		301								Liv	This bridge here... is a little different from how I imagined it would be.	1														100000497							
444	444		301									Caught by surprise, Liv seems at a loss for words.																						
445	445		302								Well, there is only so much radar imaging can do, I suppose.	446																						
446	446		301									Climbing over the rock in your way, you look up from the ground to see the view up ahead.																						
447	447		302								See, this isn't something you need to...	448																						
448	448		202							1					1																			
449	449		301									The last few words of the sentence get stuck halfway at your throat when you see what's up ahead of you.																						
450	450		502							RImgBg1BlowUp																								
451	451		301									In front of you now is a valley about 20 meters wide—with a "bridge" above it connecting either side of the valley.																						
452	452		301									Giving off a crystalline shine, the bridge consists of many "disks."																						
453	453		301									The same disks can be seen moving in irregular patterns around the "bridge."																						
454	454		301									Enveloped in their somewhat dark surroundings, they're reminiscent of glowing lamps.																						
455	455		301									With a closer look, you see that the "disks" all have long tentacles or semitransparent belts attached to the underside.																						
456	456		301									As though sensing that they're being looked at, some of the tentacles rise and wave this way.																						
457	457		401						300	1	36																							
458	458		401							1	205																							
459	459		301									The floating jellyfish is greeting you.																						
460	460		505							RImgBg1BlowUp																								
461	461		201							1	500524	3																						
462	462		301							1	Liv	I never thought we'd run into anything like this... They don't seem hostile, though.	1														100000498							
463	463		301									You never saw this coming yourself, too, because you didn't run into anything out of the ordinary the entire way.																						
464	464		301									Seems like the speed at which time passes isn't the only thing different between M.I.N.D. and the real world...																						
465	465		301									This world seems to be full of strange things that can happen to you at every turn—and the fact that Liv was able to get all the chipmunks to hang around you is but an example of that.																						
466	466		301									And with that taken into account, this "jellyfish bridge" really shouldn't be that big of a surprise.																						
467	467		302								Aren't they going to dehydrate?	468																						
468	468		301									As though trying to answer your question, a few enormous jets of water come gushing out from the depths of the valley, washing away some the of jellyfish that make up the bridge. Moments later, however, their places are taken over by other jellyfish.																						
469	469		301									Having been graced by the water, the bridge now gives off a lucid shine.																						
470	470		302								Do you know what's going on, Liv?	471																						
471	471		301								Liv	I... think this just might have something to do with the story of the "magpie bridge" that I heard as a kid.	1														100000499							
472	472		301									Liv seems unsure of herself as she speaks.																						
473	473		301									In Kowloong's folklore, the magpie bridge is a bridge formed by magpies squishing their bodies together on a certain day.																						
474	474		301									And this "jellyfish bridge" does bear a resemblance to the "magpie bridge".																						
475	475		301									Although one of them flies up there in the sky, while the other swims in the water.																						
476	476		302								Which means this M.I.N.D. shard is...	477																						
477	477		301								Liv	Yes, this particular M.I.N.D. shard probably has to do with all the fairytales I heard...	1														100000500

495	495		302								There is nothing wrong with being childish, though...	496	No, not at all.	499																				
496	496		301									These are memories of the fairytales after all.																						
497	497		302								And there is nothing wrong with that.	498																						
498	498	502	301									You find it romantic that Liv has found a way to embrace her childhood once again as a grown-up.																						
499	499		301									Liv is gentle and doesn't talk a whole lot, but she never fails to look after the people around her whenever she can.																						
500	500		301									She's mature in every sense of the word.																						
501	501		204							1	2																							
502	502		301								Liv	...	1														100000502							
503	503		301									Liv lets out a sigh of relief at what you said.																						
504	504		301								Liv	Should I try to come up with a different route, Commandant?	1														100000503							
505	505		302								Let's just run across it!	506	What's your take, Liv?	507																				
506	506	509	301									Liv nods.																						
507	507		301								Liv	Well, I think... I should probably take off my shoes first?	1														100000504							
508	508		301									Liv looks down at her lethally dangerous high heels.																						
509	509		301									With Liv's approval, you step on the semitransparent "bell" of the jellyfish, all the while feeling the slipperiness and bounciness of it.																						
510	510		302								All good.	511																						
511	511		301									Only need to stay low and go at this pace...																						
512	512		204							1	7																							
513	513		301								Liv	Commandant, come back now!	1														100000505							
514	514		301									With it, Liv grabs hold of your hand, except it's too late now.																						
515	515		301									The bell crumbles down—before it contracts inward and then hunches up...																						
516	516		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryFallNew.prefab	2																							
517	517		301									Before you know what just happened, you find yourself and Liv coming face to face with a glowing jellyfish in the air—although you can't really for the life of you tell where its eyes are.																						
518	518		203							1	0.15			-80																				
519	519		301									Before you begin falling through the air, however, the jellyfish whips out one of its "belts" and wraps it around you and Liv.																						
520	520		301									Except the combined weight of you and Liv seems too heavy for it, sending the jellyfish down into a straight fall like a parachute with a hole.																						
521	521		301									Fortunately, another jellyfish comes to your rescue in time with its belts. Working together, the two jellyfish float back up once again.																						
522	522		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryFallNew.prefab																							
523	523		203							1	0.15			-120																				
524	524		301									At the same time, the grip of the belt grows tighter still around you and Liv.																						
525	525		302								What's this thing?	526																						
526	526		301									You feel something as soft as silk against your back.																						
527	527		204							1	6																							
528	528		301								Liv	My wings... are getting squashed... Commandant...	1														100000506							
529	529		301									From behind you, Liv now speaks in a tone so choppy and low that you can barely make out her words—every last one of which seems to be coming out as the last strand of her being. Tied up tightly back to back, however, you can't see Liv's face.																						
530	530		301									Somehow, you seem to be hearing the hisses of steam.																						
531	531		302								I-I'm sorry...	532	(Remain silent)	534	(Change the subject)	535																		
532	532		301								Liv	T-that's fine, but I think this is exactly how we're supposed to cross the valley.	1														100000507							
533	533	537	301									And Liv is right—because you can see that the shining jellyfish and its friend are transporting the two of you to the other side of the valley.																						
534	534	537	301									Remaining silent the entire way, you let the jellyfish do their job.																						
535	535		302								That doesn't seem to be a bridge.	536																						
536	536	537	301								Liv	Yup. I think this is exactly how we're supposed to get across the valley.	1														100000508							
537	537		204							1																								
538	538		301									From the corner of your eye, you can see that the jellyfish you stepped on at the very beginning is cleaning its "bell" of the dirt on it using the dews coming off a chunk of moss that it's holding with its tentacles.																						
539	539		301									When it's done grooming itself, the jellyfish does look slightly shinier than it did just moments ago.																						
540	540		302								Is it trying to polish itself?	541																						
541	541		301								Liv	I don't think they're trying to build a bridge cuddling up together. I think they're just trying to rest.	1														100000509							
542	542		301									With a closer look, you see that Liv is right—the jellyfish that you initially thought was acting as the bridge's pier doesn't shine as brightly. With its bell going up and down ever so faintly, it appears to be under a light sleep.																						
543	543		302								So what the jellyfish did to me just now when I stepped on it just now...	544																						
544	544		204						300	1	8																							
545	545		204							1	2																							
546	546		301								Liv	Well... that was probably just the jellyfish feeling grumpy waking up?	1														100000510							
547	547		301									Liv sounds at ease, sensing no harm coming from the jellyfish—but right then, your surroundings start growing dark. Moments later, you feel something hard against the bottom of your feet, and the grip around you lets go.																						
548	548		203							1	0.25																							
549	549		301									Turning around, you see that the jellyfish is still there—and it's now trying to flatten Liv's crumpled wings.																						
550	550		301								Liv	Thank you all, but don't worry about it.	1														100000511							
551	551		301									The jellyfish, however, stays where it is, its tentacles obviously not the most ideal of tools with which to flatten the creases.																						
552	552		302								Let me fix them for you.	553																						
553	553		204							1	7																							
554	554		301								Liv	Wait, what...?! But why are you...	1														100000512							
555	555		302								I'm sure they won't let us go if I don't do it.	556																						
556	556		301									Looking up, you see that the jellyfish are still busy trying to fix Liv's wings.																						
557	557		204							1	3																							
558	558		302								And I'm partially responsible for it anyways.	559																						
559	559		204							1	6																							
560	560		301								Liv	Well, then... if you insist.	1														100000513							
561	561		301									Bit by bit, you flatten the creases in the chiffon-like wings in the gentle light coming off the jellyfish.																						
562	562		301									Then, looking up at the jellyfish and then at Liv's wings—now being slowly flattened back to their previous state—you open your mouth to speak.																						
563	563		302								This is just amazing.	564																						
564	564		204						300	1	8																							
565	565		204							1	2																							
566	566		301								Liv	This doesn't happen in real life, though.	1														100000514							
567	567		302								But even with everything that seemed to stand in our way...	568																						
568	568		302								People have made amazing breakthroughs and made the impossible possible.	569																						
569	569		301									Gravity tried to hold humans down, but we found a way to reach the sky and even further beyond; distance stood between us, but technology made it possible for us to connect with each other whenever we wanted; lightning was once a power inspiring our awe, but we found a way to make it work for us...																						
570	570		204							1	3																							
571	571		301								Liv	Do you think there is a way... for us to make what we're seeing here possible, then?	1														100000515							
572	572		301									The jellyfish form a colorful, fantastic view around you beyond description.																						
573	573		302								Somewhere down the road, yes.	574	With difficulty, yes.	576	I don't think so.	578																		
574	574		204							1	2																							
575	575	580	301									"It might seem like a far-fetched fantasy, but nothing is impossible, so long as there are people drawn to it."																						
576	576		204							1																								
577	577	579	301									"But even if we're still so far from that day that we can't even picture it happening within our lifetime, we can still entrust another dreamer with our dream."																						
578	578		301									"But that doesn't mean we need to forget it altogether. Perfection might be a difficult goal to reach, but that doesn't mean we can't come up with something that's nearly perfect."																						
579	579		204							1	2																							
580	580		301									You flatten the last crease on Liv's wings. Although still unable to take Liv through the skies and now bearing shallow scars, Liv's wings can open up again nonetheless.																						
581	581		302								There is not a wonderful thing that is not worth our time and effort.	582																						
582	582		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					This is what the forest seems to be mumbling as the breeze gently ruffles the leaves.
