17	17		301							1	Rosetta	Run away! The tide is coming!	1																					
18	18		301									The girl grabbed by Rosetta stares at her curiously. The other frolicking girls also pause and stare at Rosetta in interest.	1																					
19	19		301								Girl	Wait, what's going on? Who are you...																						
20	20		301									Anxious, Rosetta turns with the girl in hand, attempting to pull her out of this place by force.	1																					
21	21		301									But she pauses at the sight behind her—the forest is still and silent, without any sound of bionics, as if the tide itself had never happened.	1																					
22	22		401							1	204																							
23	23		301								Girl	Are you... the girl who lives in the forest we've heard rumors about?!

27	26		301								Girl	Hah! Whaddaya say? I told you the "girl in the forest" wasn't just a rumor! That's what you get for laughing at me!																						
28	27		301									The other girls gather around Rosetta, looking at her curiously.																						
29	28		301								Girl	I'm Lisa. What's your name?																						
30	29		301								Rosetta	Rosetta...	1																					
31	30		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lisa	Hi, Rosetta! Now that we know each other's names, that makes us friends! Come on! Let's play!

35	34		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					It was a completely new world to Rosetta. She never thought she would be so happy just talking aimlessly with other girls or playing silly games.

37	36		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Lisa	Rosetta, thanks for playing with us for so long and telling us so much about the forest!

44	43		301							1	Rosetta	Grandpa! Sorry... I was worried that the bionics were going to attack the girls. So I had to warn them... I won't do it again!	1																					
45	44		201							1	500200																							
46	45		301									To Rosetta's surprise, Pfaff did not seem to be angry. Instead, he politely waves at the girls.	1																					
47	46		301							1	Pfaff	Rosetta, don't forget to wave and say goodbye to your friends. You don't want to be rude, do you?	1

57	56		301								Rosetta	Nope, not at all... I have you and the animals in the forest, Grandpa... And there's the Guardian Spirit. Everything is fine just the way it is.	1

64	63		301								Pfaff	Don't worry. The Guardian Spirit has returned, and the tide will be gone soon.	2																					
65	64		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Pfaff puts two fingers to his lips and blows a long and loud whistle. Rosetta runs excitedly to the side of the mountain, taking in the view of the sea—
