7	7		301							1	Bexonidas	Almost!	3																					
8	8		301								Gryphon	You said so the last time I asked! And where's Castien?	2																					
9	9		301								Bexonidas	Bought it early!	3																					
10	10		301									The radio had died along with Castien.

12	12		301									A tiny squad running a diversion against a horde that size... Without cover, the result was anyone's guess.																						
13	13		301									After an hour-long intense battle, the ten-man squad is down to three.																						
14	14		301									Except Halan sacrificed himself in an explosion to cover Bexonidas and Gryphon's escape.																						
15	15		301									Which means that the two of them are all that's left.																						
16	16		301									The two are crouched in a shallow foxhole, firing from behind a beat-up vehicle.																						
17	17		301									Except they won't even be able to keep up the fire for long, as all they have left are three magazines.																						
18	18		301									...As long as they hold out until Watanabe and his "guests" finish the job, the tide might just turn.																						
19	19		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					At least, that's what Bexonidas thinks.
