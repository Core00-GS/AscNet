15	14		301							1	Chrome	This is Strike Hawk. We have arrived at the outskirts of City 075.	1																					
16	15		301								Chrome	The area looks clear at the moment. No sign of the Corrupted or Red Tide. We will begin searching for Huaxu's signal along the planned route.	1

20	19		301							1	Kamui	Capt, how does it look?	2																					
21	20		301								Chrome	Communication has been unstable since we arrived. The closer we are to the city center, the stronger the interference gets. It's advisable to finish all preparations before we commence the mission.	1																					
22	21		204							2	1																							
23	22		301								Kamui	Speaking of which, Gray Raven should be in the area too, right?	2																					
24	23		301								Chrome	Well, Gray Raven entered from the east while we came in from the west of the city. Since we can only narrow down Huaxu's location to a 5-10km radius, there may still be some distance between us.	1																					
25	24		301								Kamui	The other airborne units are also looking for Huaxu, right? I mean the Support Force, the Mountain Owls, and the Cerberus...	2																					
26	25		301								Chrome	Yeah. They all came in the city from different directions.	1																					
27	26		204							2	2																							
28	27		301								Kamui	Then we can't let them beat us!	2																					
29	28		301								Kamui	I know we're no match for Liv, but the Strike Hawk's radar is still outstanding, isn't it, Captain?	2																					
30	29		301									Chrome does not even raise an eyebrow at Kamui's sudden enthusiasm.

33	32		301								Kamui	I know. I always treat my missions with utmost sincerity!	2																					
34	33		301								Chrome	Besides, Huaxu isn't the top priority for the Strike Hawk. Our first and foremost task is figuring out the Red Tide's source and collecting samples.	1

46	45		301									Hassen's signal is choppy but finally stabilizes at a recognizable level.																						
47	46		301								Chrome	We are trying to locate the Red Tide and Huaxu along the planned route.	1																					
48	47		301								Hassen	You have a new mission objective. From now on, locating Gray Raven is your priority.	2																					
49	48		201							1	1081001		-400																					
50	49		301							1	Kamui	Gray Raven? What happened to them?	1																					
51	50		301								Hassen	...That's the problem. We have absolutely no way to find out their current status. A few minutes ago we lost all communication with them.	2																					
52	51		201							1	500155		-400																					
53	52		301							1	Chrome	Hmm...	1																					
54	53		301								Hassen	They may have encountered unexpected situations or even danger.	2																					
55	54		301								Hassen	Orâ€”they may have already found their target, but interference is too strong around that area for them to reach out.	2																					
56	55		301								Hassen	Considering the actual condition of this place and Gray Raven's capability, I think the latter is more probable.	2																					
57	56		301								Chrome	We shouldn't be more than 20km from the Gray Ravens. Try contacting them via shortwave communication.	1
