3	3		301			DialogEnable						The structure of the Demon King's Castle wasn't too different from the previous ones. Before arriving at the center, we had to go through corridors with lots of traps.																						
4	4		301									Just when we defeated the guards and started heading further inside the castle, Kamui triggered the traps. He never let us down.

6	6		301							1	Kamui	Whoa!	1																					
7	7		201							1	500173																							
8	8		301							1	Lee	Can't you check the surroundings before you move?	1

10	10		301							1	Lucia	Commandant, watch out!	1																					
11	11		302								Dodge them.	12	Take out recovery potions.	15																				
12	12		301									The attacks launched by the traps that Kamui triggered came right at me. Thanks to Lucia's warning, I was able to dodge some of them.																						
13	13		301								Lucia	Ha!	1																					
14	14	19	301									Lucia helped to destroy the remaining attacks. I was safe, at least temporarily.																						
15	15		301									The attacks launched by the traps that Kamui triggered came right at me, but I didn't feel like dodging them at all. Instead, I remembered what Camu taught me and took out potions from the bag.																						
16	16		301									The damage of the traps was easily mitigated by the healing.																						
17	17		201							1	500173																							
18	18		301							1	Lee	How many times have you done this, Commandant...	1																					
19	19		201							1	1081001	1																						
20	20		301							1	Kamui	Speaking of which, did you purposely send the artifact to them? I still don't quite understand your plan, but you shouldn't keep it from me!	1																					
21	21		201							1	500166	1																						
22	22		301							1	Lucia	We had no plan to keep it from you. The explanation was omitted because we thought everyone could easily understand. 	1																					
23	23		201							1	1081001	1																						
24	24		301							1	Kamui	But I only learned about it just now.	1																					
25	25		201							1	500173																							
26	26		301							1	Lee	You are an unexpected factor. Luckily, Camu knows your moves. Otherwise the plan will be all messed up.	1																					
27	27		201							1	1081001	2																						
28	28		301							1	Kamui	I didn't expect him to know me so well either.	1																					
29	29		302								He's always watching you, isn't he?	30	Don't you share the same body?	31																				
30	30	32	301								Kamui	True. That's how he learned all the game knowledge...	1																					
31	31		301								Kamui	True. We share the same frame, of course he knows my habit.	1																					
32	32		201							1	500166																							
33	33		301							1	Lucia	Anyway, Kamui will slow the team down walking in front. Lee, you go to the front, and we will follow you.	1																					
34	34		201							1	500173																							
35	35		301							1	Lee	Agreed.	1

40	40		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Vera	This is the so-called altar. Can I give you all the artifact now, King?	1																					
41	41		201							1	500011																							
42	42		301							1	King	Correct. Oh, please also move the Holy Maiden onto the altar.	1																					
43	43		201							1	500174																							
44	44		301							1	Liv	...King, do you have to destroy this world for your own dream?	1																					
45	45		201							1	500011																							
46	46		301							1	King	Hah, of course. And you can't say no right now!	1																					
47	47		301									Following the King's order, Liv's black bracelet gave a shimmering light. Her hands were automatically lifted, and the artifact fragments started to merge.																						
48	48		301								King	Great, I was worried that it might not work on heroes. After all, it's a cheating item made from modified bottom layer code.	1
