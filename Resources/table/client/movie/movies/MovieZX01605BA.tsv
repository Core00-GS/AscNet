8	8		301			DialogEnable				1	Lucia	We need to find a suitable method to track their whereabouts, or at least uncover enough intel to establish a starting point... Right?	3																					
9	9		302								That's right.	10																						
10	10		301								Lee	Liv, scan the entire block for data. If it was machine or AI logic, we should be able to detect a pattern...	2																					
11	11		301								Lee	"Nay all speech, even the commonest speech, has something of song in it." Such is the case for humans, so, too, does it apply to machines.	2																					
12	12		302								"On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History"?	13																						
13	13		301								Lee	Right as always, Commandant. In other words, we should look for this element of "song."	2																					
14	14		301								Liv	I scanned the whole block, and there are multiple data signals... Which one should I track?	1																					
15	15		301								Liv	Two of them obviously belong to the Babylonia Task Force. As for the remaining two, one I have never seen before, and the other is from Team "Ouroboros"... That name sounds familiar...	1																					
16	16		301								Lee	...Is that Commander Nikola's team? They always seem to be carrying out missions, but no one ever knows what they're about.	2																					
17	17		302								What are they doing here?	18																						
18	18		301								Lee	Generally speaking, it's above our pay grade.	2																					
19	19		301								Lee	Even if you ask, the Commander will just say "no comment."	2																					
20	20		301								Lee	So... What should we do?	2																					
21	21		301								Lee	Tracking the more probable signal of the two Task Force might be the most promising. Even if the program has a disguised ID, it wouldn't be Ouroboros or that signal we've never seen before.	2																					
22	22		302								Why's that?	23																						
23	23		301								Lee	If it were a signal we've never seen before, wouldn't that be more suspicious?	2																					
24	24		301								Lee	As for the two unknown signals, let Asimov check them after we solve the issue in the virtual space.	2																					
25	25		301								Lee	At present, we should focus our efforts on solving the more urgent task at hand.	2																					
26	26		301								Lucia	As long as we find "Bianca"... or any sign of Huaxu, our current problem may be solved.	3																					
27	27		301								Lee	The only source of intrusion we've found so far is Huaxu disguising as Bianca.	2																					
28	28		301								Lucia	So, I believe that is our best shot.	3																					
29	29		301								Lee	...That makes sense.	2																					
30	30		302								Then let's start looking.	31

41	41		301								Asimov	What is it?	2																					
42	42		301								Karenina	Bridget said that the energy reserve is almost emptied to keep the engines operational! Power reduction impact is expandingâ€”the voltage regulators of the bridge and Gestalt can't counter this much fluctuation!	1																					
43	43		301								Asimov	You mean, if the energy fluctuations expand further...	2																					
44	44		301								Karenina	...It'll be too late for Gestalt and the Gray Ravens inside.	1																					
45	45		301								Asimov	If we can use the independent emergency power of the ship, we may be able to hold out a little longer...	2																					
46	46		301								Karenina	Hey, Chief Technician! If you have any ideas, now is the time!	1																					
47	47		301								Asimov	Turn off the thermostatic system in the residential quarters and divert the energy pipeline to Gestalt!	2																					
48	48		301								Asimov	As for the bridge... We'll have to use some elbow grease.	2

50	50		301								Karenina	?	1																					
51	51		301								Asimov	Apart from what is needed to maintain the immersion... We'll manually transfer all pipelines, and turn off everything that is not necessary.	2																					
52	52		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Karenina	...That seems a bit primitive, but it just might work.	1
