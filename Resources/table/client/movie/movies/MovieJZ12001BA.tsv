3	3		301			DialogEnable						Stepping back into the Smith Estate, Chrome feels an odd sense of nostalgia.																						
4	4		301									He has never returned home with this sensation in the past. Since becoming a Construct, his home has been the lounge he shares with Strike Hawk. His communications with John have mostly been done through his comms.																						
5	5		301									The furniture in the estate looks identical to how it was when he left. Even the vases and framed paintings have not moved an inch.																						
6	6		301									It is as if his home and the person living in it have frozen in time together, in a fittingly cold, indifferent house.																						
7	7		301								Service Bot R2	Facial scans completed—confirming identity—identity confirmed: Construct, Chrome.

21	21		301							1	John	I've heard about the specialized frame from Nikola.	2																					
22	22		301								John	The risk it poses is still too difficult to gauge, and it comes with complicated baggage. I think it's best for you to put your attention elsewhere before the technology is mature.	2																					
23	23		301								John	Stop getting sidetracked and learn to identify what is worthwhile like how I taught you.	2																					
24	24		301								Chrome	I'm actually here to talk about this.	1																					
25	25		301								Chrome	I've decided to take part in the specialized frame experiment.	1																					
26	26		301								John	You don't want to stay as a Construct captain of a scout team forever, do you?	2																					
27	27		301								John	You're my son. You'll enter the administration eventually, so you have to start preparing for the day when you stop being a Construct and become someone that actually matters.	2																					
28	28		301									Chrome looks down and swipes his hand over the table, and a holographic projection of a chessboard appears above it.																						
29	29		301								Chrome	Pardon me, Mr. Smith. Would you play a game of chess with me?	1																					
30	30		301								John	What is this?	2																					
31	31		301								Chrome	I don't think you've seen me fight on the field, have you?	1																					
32	32		301								John	If you're talking about those pointless missions... I'm too busy to read those reports.	2																					
33	33		301								John	I only care about the results.	2																					
34	34		301								John	And I already played you in the past, remember? Twice we have played, and twice you have lost.	2																					
35	35		301								Chrome	I have been practicing and improving since then, but you haven't given me another chance to prove myself.	1																					
36	36		301								John	I don't like wasting my time.	2																					
37	37		301								Chrome	What if I say that this is the first game between us?	1																					
38	38		301								John	What do you mean?	2																					
39	39		204							1	5																							
40	40		301								Chrome	You're no longer playing Langston. You'll be playing Chrome.	1																					
41	41		301								Chrome	I want to show you how I think and, if I can, what I've been thinking.	1																					
42	42		301								Chrome	The many questions you have for me will also be answered by this game.	1

44	44		301								John	...	2																					
45	45		301								John	I hope you won't be embarrassing yourself.	2																					
46	46		301									Chrome nods in courtesy before gesturing for John to be the White player and make the first move.																						
47	47		301									John thinks for a second before issuing his command.																						
48	48		301								John	Pawn, E2 to E4.	2																					
49	49		301									The projection of the chess piece advances on the board.																						
50	50		301								Chrome	(This...)	1																					
51	51		301								Chrome	(This is how he started the first time we played.)	1																					
52	52		301								Chrome	Pawn, E7 to E5.	1																					
53	53		301								John	So you still remember.	2																					
54	54		301								Chrome	I remember every game we played.	1																					
55	55		301									Staring at Chrome, John issues another command. Chrome stares back and responds in a relaxed manner.																						
56	56		301									The Black Pawn moves to D6, forming a line of defense.																						
57	57		301								Chrome	You've been playing the exact moves as before.	1																					
58	58		301								John	So have you.	2																					
59	59		301								John	I thought you would change.	2

66	66		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						It is an opulent display—people in lavish clothes walking between tables laid with the finest food and the freshest flowers, their chatters and stale laughter bouncing in the room, reverberating in his audio system.																						
67	67		301									As if a reenactment of a time long passed, this place looks just like a feast of the Golden Age.																						
68	68		301									While many are fighting with their lives on the frontline, some are here, at the topmost level of Eden, living luxuriously, no different from how they did on Earth.																						
69	69		301									Some people go to hell, while others go to heaven.																						
70	70		301									The dissonance makes the young man frown.																						
71	71		301									He should not be here.																						
72	72		301									The smell of gunpowder burning in barrels, the feeling of the mud in the trenches, the pain of his skin tearing when engaging an enemy... That is the life he knows now.																						
73	73		301									Instead, he is wearing a suit that does not match his station, standing in an indulgent hotel ballroom coated in gold, holding a glass of wine someone handed him—he is a Construct. He does not drink or eat.																						
74	74		301								???	Langston.																						
75	75		301									His wandering thoughts return, and he finds John Smith looking at him.

82	82		301							1	John	They are a Babylonia officer and a councilman. They've been hoping to meet you.	1

86	86		301								Officer	Leading an elite team to locate and help destroy 23 Corrupted clusters, taking back 5 major bases, being a decorated soldier and a Chief from the F.O.S. Military Command College... I expect nothing less from the son of John Smith.	1																					
87	87		301								Officer	I'm sure it comforts you to know that you have a worthy successor, Mr. Smith.	1

96	96		301								Chatter	A Construct... I guess that's the end of him getting any real power.																						
97	97		301								Chatter	I suppose this is the end of the line for the Smiths... What else can he do? Gamble his legacy on a Construct?																						
98	98		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Chatter	The Constructs are just puppets without a human.

106	106		301								John	You've always been a smart boy. You should know what I'm talking about.	2																					
107	107		301								John	The war will be over one day.	2																					
108	108		301								John	Have you thought about what awaits the Constructs once their duty is fulfilled?	2																					
109	109		301								John	I've always taught you to look to the future while watching the present.	2																					
110	110		301								John	You should be thinking about what happens afterward.	2																					
111	111		301								John	The Smiths think further than everyone else. That is how we have survived and thrived until now through all kinds of calamities.	2																					
112	112		301								John	We do not care about bloodlines—what we care about is the legacy of our name. So... human or Construct, you are the successor of John Smith. That will never change.	2																					
113	113		301								John	All you have to do is move forward and complete your tasks flawlessly. Show me what your future is.	2																					
114	114		301								John	You've picked the path of a Construct...	2																					
115	115		301								John	It means you have to work for it even harder. It means you will find even more difficulties and hard decisions ahead of you.	2																					
116	116		301								John	Nikola mentioned your performance outside City 075. Lowest Construct casualties, highest threat removal rate, all under your lead. You even managed to update Babylonia on the Red Tide despite the signal interference.	2																					
117	117		301								Chrome	...	1																					
118	118		301								John	And the missions before that. You have completed them all perfectly, irreproachable.	2																					
119	119		301								John	But do these small victories satisfy you?	2																					
120	120		301								Chrome	I was simply doing my job as a Construct. My current teammates...	1																					
121	121		301								John	Have you become that gullible after knowing those Constructs?	2																					
122	122		301									John looks at the busy, bustling ballroom in the background and continues.																						
123	123		301								John	This is the real world, Chrome. Past or present, power is the only thing that matters.	2																					
124	124		301								John	During the Great Evacuation, the most invaluable supply ships and the most exceptional soldiers were used to transport meaningless junk...	2																					
125	125		301								John	...Simply because those junk belonged to people with power.	2																					
126	126		301								John	Do you find it ridiculous? But if it weren't for the sponsorship of those people in power, Constructs wouldn't have been created, and Babylonia wouldn't even liftoff.	2																					
127	127		301								John	There is no era when you can ignore the profits power brings.	2																					
128	128		301								John	You should understand what to abandon by now, and what duty you should have accepted long ago.	2

136	136		301									Someone has asked him a similar question, he thinks. This was what he answered.																						
137	137		301									Will Kamui really do as he said and go play all the games he is interested in, even trying to make a living out of it?																						
138	138		301									Regardless of his plans, Wanshi will finally get to take a good rest without getting dragged into a mission from his sleeping pod in the middle of the sleep.																						
139	139		301									Kids love him. Maybe he can return to his old department and continues his career before the war. He was so good at it.																						
140	140		301									From Chrome's perspective, they all come with infinite possibilities.																						
141	141		301									But... will the future after they win turn out as perfect as they imagine?
