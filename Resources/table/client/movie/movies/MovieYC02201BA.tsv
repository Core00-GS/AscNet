20	20		301							1		In front of them is a city that has long since fallen into the hands of another ruler. Hetero-Creatures are seen here and there in the ruins, twitching and hissing from time to time.	1																					
21	21		301									Desolate and disorderly, this is what the planet looks like today. Row after row of lofty buildings deteriorated into dead trees made of steel and cement. Now, living creatures fight for survival in this dark jungle.

24	24		301									With a muffled thud, the Hetero-Creatures that have followed the footsteps and arrived are torn apart by a flash of light in front of the wanderer.

26	26		301							1	???	So the defective product of Gabriel has made it this far.	1																					
27	27		301									The wanderer leisurely puts away his chain blade and looks at the shadows cast by the distant buildings.																						
28	28		301									In the distant shadows, a few figures are huddled around a campfire, cooking food with simple cooking utensils.																						
29	29		301								???	Looks like our "actor" has arrived on set.	1

37	37		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Vonnegut	Again, welcome aboard, Roland.	2																					
38	38		301								Roland	Save the pleasantries.	1																					
39	39		301									Feeling the changes in his body, Roland clenches his fists and grins a slightly mocking smile.																						
40	40		301									Aided by some mysterious power—the power bestowed to him by that pure white agent—he can still sense Luna's existence. Even though it's no more than a delicate strand of silk, she is somewhere within this world.																						
41	41		301									The mysterious "Merciful One" hadn't erased his weak connection with Luna after reconfiguring his body, but the unpredictable agent in front of him seems to mind.																						
42	42		301								Vonnegut	Is that enough?	2																					
43	43		301								Vonnegut	You must have known that I rarely give others the privilege to become an Ascendant. After all, even though our goal is the same, my selection process is slightly different from Luna's.	2																					
44	44		301								Vonnegut	However, that doesn't mean that I'll be stingy in sharing my power with you. Since it's such a generous offer, I thought you would make the best use of it, rather than take a sip before setting it down.	2																					
45	45		204							1	1																							
46	46		301								Roland	You're very generous, but this is good enough for me. I'm not going rusty yet and I still need it most of the time.	1																					
47	47		301									Yes, this is enough. He doesn't want the risk of wielding such strong power to come back to bite him one day. As long as he maintains a weak connection, he will have the possibility to achieve his ultimate goal.																						
48	48		301									He just needs to lie dormant and wait for the right time. He is already quite adept at doing so.																						
49	49		301								Vonnegut	I understand.	2																					
50	50		301									Vonnegut slowly raises an eyebrow and claps.																						
51	51		301								Vonnegut	The loyal "knight" is still unwilling to completely cut off his connection to the "king."	2																					
52	52		204							1																								
53	53		301								Roland	Does it bother you to have such a troublemaker as your subordinate?	1																					
54	54		301								Vonnegut	No, of course not.	2																					
55	55		301								Vonnegut	This is exactly what I admire about you, Roland. You are persistent but not foolish.	2																					
56	56		301									Roland sneers.																						
57	57		204							1	1																							
58	58		301								Roland	So much for the flattering. Let's cut to the chase.	1																					
59	59		301								Roland	What is it that you want me to do? Seems you guys had quite the show with Babylonia while I was trying to repair my frame.	1																					
60	60		204							1	2																							
61	61		301								Roland	Too bad I wasn't there.	1																					
62	62		301								Vonnegut	I didn't deliberately hide the location of the "test subject," but I didn't expect Babylonia to find it so quickly.	2																					
63	63		301								Vonnegut	But I had no desire to draw their attention so soon. It appears Babylonia is smarter than I expected.	2																					
64	64		301								Vonnegut	That being said, I found a "seed" that shows potential.	2																					
65	65		301									As if thinking of something pleasant, Vonnegut's eyes show a clear smile.																						
66	66		301								Vonnegut	Compared with this discovery, the "test subject" was an acceptable loss.	2																					
67	67		301								Roland	First time I've ever heard someone phrase "the enemy outplayed us" so casually.	1																					
68	68		301								Roland	Some of Babylonia's teams... are more troublesome than others.	1																					
69	69		301								Vonnegut	Alas, opposition is not eternal.	2																					
70	70		301								Vonnegut	Conversely, neither is allegiance.	2																					
71	71		301								Vonnegut	Both you and I are focused on net gain, are you not?	2																					
72	72		301								Vonnegut	So long as everything is within my grasp, I can turn anything into an opportunity.	2																					
73	73		301								Vonnegut	After all, I can provide what they need most. Sooner or later, they will definitely consider my proposal.	2																					
74	74		204							1	1																							
75	75		301								Roland	So that "test subject" was destroyed and you're going to make an even more powerful test subject No. 2, right?	1																					
76	76		301								Roland	I seem to have seen the same tactic used by a former "companion"... It's a pity that he failed in the end.	1																					
77	77		301								Vonnegut	Indeed. The truly vital "Mother" isn't stored here. Cinderelik has gone to investigate its condition.	2																					
78	78		301								Vonnegut	Gabriel is well-deserving of praise for his efforts on pioneering the gestation of Hetero-Creatures.	2																					
79	79		301								Vonnegut	We need only to take over his unfinished research and continue to explore more possibilities.	2																					
80	80		301								Vonnegut	The emergence of the Red Tide and Hetero-Creatures is undoubtedly an important step in the evolution of Ascnet. Unfortunately, the "Polyphage" has demonstrated the limit of evolution based on Hetero-Cores.	2																					
81	81		301								Vonnegut	These creatures only have the instinct to survive. They show no signs of intelligence or reason.	2																					
82	82		301								Vonnegut	What's the difference between such a thing and those defective products that lose cognition due to corruption? No matter how destructive they are, they are only fit to be called puppets.	2																					
83	83		301								Vonnegut	How can we walk with such creatures in the new world?	2																					
84	84		301								Vonnegut	A large part of Gabriel's failure was due to his blind pursuit of power, his eagerness for success, and his neglect of the Punishing Virus's will.	2																					
85	85		301								Vonnegut	As for "Mother"... Its appearance served as guidance to Gabriel's massively misguided path.	2																					
86	86		301								Vonnegut	I can feel that "Mother" is the condensation of the Punishing Virus's will. She possesses fascinating possibilities.	2																					
87	87		301								Vonnegut	I have high hopes for its future.	2																					
88	88		204							1	7																							
89	89		301								Roland	So, even you don't know what "Mother" will hatch?	1																					
90	90		204							1																								
91	91		301								Roland	I thought people like you would always want to have everything under control.	1																					
92	92		301								Vonnegut	It seems that we still need mutual understanding.	2																					
93	93		301								Vonnegut	All we can do now is witness the gestation of "Mother" and welcome the real cumulation of the Punishing Virus's will.	2																					
94	94		301								Vonnegut	...We just need to give her a little push.	2																					
95	95		204							1	7																							
96	96		301								Roland	A push?	1																					
97	97		301								Vonnegut	Before that, I think you should see something.	2																					
98	98		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Vonnegut	You haven't seen "Mother" in her entirety, have you?	2
