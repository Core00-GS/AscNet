100	100		301								Vanessa	But if that's how you view them, I have no interest in getting involved. After all, they're your playthings anyway.	1																					
101	101		302								Constructs aren't "playthings" built to serve.	102																						
102	102		301								Vanessa	Comrades to you, toys to me. Family to him, tools to her. It's irrelevant. Each team interacts differently.	1																					
103	103		301								Vanessa	At any rate, the powers that be only care about completing the mission.	1																					
104	104		301								Vanessa	But there's still one thing I'd like to say...	1																					
105	105		301									Vanessa leans in and whispers into your ear.																						
106	106		301								Vanessa	Don't worry, you can cut the act.	1																					
107	107		301								Vanessa	You can kick 'em to the curb whenever you've had your fun.	1																					
108	108		301								Vanessa	Even the most beautiful of toys is worthless if it refuses to listen.	1																					
109	109		301								Vanessa	Compared to such an exquisite dollhouse, they belong in the dump. Do they not?	1

111	111		301							1	Liv	Vaness... Chief, please focus on the mission.	1

117	117		301							1	Vanessa	Hmph, why let go so easily? Hold on a little longer if you'd like. After all, it'd give others a chance to see another side of you, Chief.	1

125	125		301								Lucia	Apologies for interrupting you, but the Corrupted threat still hasn't been alleviated. We must focus our efforts on the mission.	1																					
126	126		301								Lucia	Neglecting one's duty may be detrimental to the success of the mission. If the higher-ups want to point fingers, you'll be shouldering the blame as the chief commander.	1																					
127	127		301								Vanessa	...Hmph.	2																					
128	128		301									Vanessa quietly sighs, then returns to her seat surrounded by screens.
