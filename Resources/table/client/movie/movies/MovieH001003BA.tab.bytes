6	6		302								Lucia?	7																						
7	7		301									You call out for Lucia, but you get no response.																						
8	8		301									Looking around, you do not see anything peculiar aside from a magnificent palace.

14	14		301									You lean over and you feel around the strange flooring. Inch by inch, you feel invisible cracks on the floor.																						
15	15		302								My vision is being interfered...	16																						
16	16		301									You do not feel anything abnormal with your body. That can only mean the interference is external.																						
17	17		301									In that case, the answer is obvious‚Äî																						
18	18		302								Augmented reality...	19																						
19	19		301									The room is shrouded in augmented reality, completely changing its appearance. The cracks on the ground must have come from Lucia.																						
20	20		301									AR tech matured early on during the Golden Age. Back then, most people only used it for entertainment.																						
21	21		301									It is only fitting that it would be on an island which seemed to primarily serve as a tourist attraction.																						
22	22		301									But there is one more problem...																						
23	23		302								Why did it start up all of a sudden?	24	Why hadn't I been woken up by the fighting?	24																				
24	24		201							1	500354																							
25	25		301							1	???	Good morning, Your Highness.	1																					
26	26		301									Suddenly, a short robot pushing a food cart enters the room.																						
27	27		302								A Mini Bot?	28	A Corrupted?	28																				
28	28		301									It remains quiet, but you can tell that it's not a Corrupted by its movement.																						
29	29		301									What's with the uncorrupted robot here?																						
30	30		301								???	Your Highness, did the frankincense give you a good night's sleep?	1																					
31	31		302								Frankincense?	32	Is that why I didn't wake up?	32																				
32	32		301								???	Breakfast is served. Once you've finished eating, please board the ship so we can begin your birthday celebration! Today's your special day!	1																					
33	33		302								Who are you?	34																						
34	34		301								Attendant	I'm your attendant. Still a bit drowsy, Your Highness?	1																					
35	35		302								What are you doing?	36																						
36	36		301									The attendant remains quiet and places your breakfast on the table.																						
37	37		301								Attendant	Please enjoy.	1																					
38	38		302								So...	39																						
39	39		301								Attendant	Please enjoy.	1																					
40	40		301									The robot in front of you clearly is not corrupted, but based on its behavior, this model seems to have rudimentary AI.																						
41	41		301									If that's the case... You'll have to ask questions with the right keywords to get any answers.																						
42	42		302								I have a question.	43	I need to speak to a human.	43	I want to leave a bad review.	45																		
43	43		301								Attendant	Please enjoy.	1																					
44	44	42	301									The attendant repeats its mechanical dialogue.																						
45	45		301									Hearing this, the attendant turns around.																						
46	46		301								Attendant	Contacting customer service.	1																					
47	47		302								...Looks like we're getting somewhere.	48																						
48	48		401							2	1515																							
49	49		301									After several seconds, a female voice comes from the attendant's frame																						
50	50		301								Female Voice	Greetings, valued customer. Are you dissatisfied with our service?	1																					
51	51		302								What kind of service is this?	52																						
52	52		301								Female Voice	This is the "Fairy Tale Immersion Xperience" package that you ordered. You can also change to the "Survival Horror Immersion Xperience", "Detective Immersion Xperience" or "Dragons and Magic Immersion Xperience".	1																					
53	53		301								Female Voice	Though I must warn you, the other Xperiences are significantly more dangerous.	1																					
54	54		401							1	36																							
55	55		302								I want off this ride.	56																						
56	56		401							1	201																							
57	57		301									The attendant's eyes flash red.																						
58	58		301								Female Voice	Apologies, valued customer. Since you have arrived on the island, that means that your purchase has been completed. You cannot leave this island until you have completed your Xperience.	1																					
59	59		302								And if I insist on leaving?	60																						
60	60		301								Female Voice	The staff will execute force against valued customers who disrupt the Xperience.	1																					
61	61		301									The attendant's eyes flash red again.																						
62	62		302								...	63																						
63	63		301								Female Voice	You must complete your role in this story.	1																					
64	64		301								Female Voice	You must reach the last act of this story.	1																					
65	65		301								Female Voice	Once the "mermaid princess" turns into seafoam, the island's AR system will be disabled and you can then leave.	1																					
66	66		302								Turning into seafoam is also a part of the performance?	67																						
67	67		301								Female Voice	Correct.	1																					
68	68		301									The female voice seems intent on turning the "mermaid princess" into seafoam. An ominous premonition comes to mind.																						
69	69		301									You have seen some active robots elsewhere, whose behavior seems to have become more erratic from the island‚Äôs long vacancy. But in essence, they are still "in service."																						
70	70		301									But now...																						
71	71		302								(I wonder if any Corrupted are among them.)	72																						
72	72		301									You still do not know the answer to this question.																						
73	73		301									If it is just the attendant in front of you, you are confident you can handle yourself. However, this island has a lot left to explore, and its total number of armed forces remains unclear. It is best for you to meet up with Lucia first.																						
74	74		302								Where's Lucia?	75																						
75	75		301								Female Voice	You just need to follow the development of the story, and you will meet up with the rest of the cast.	1																					
76	76		301								Attendant	Your Highness, your birthday ship has arrived in the port.	1																					
77	77		302								Don't call me "Your Highness."	78	...	79																				
78	78		301								Female Voice	Your title cannot be changed. Regardless of gender or age, as long as you play the role of the prince, the attendant will refer to you this way.	1																					
79	79		301								Female Voice	Sorry to disrupt your breakfast experience, but you must follow the attendant to the port.	1

88	88		301								Lee	We've already submitted a request for a search and rescue team. All we can do is wait.	2																					
89	89		301								Lee	There's still a massive number of Corrupted below the surface. We can't do anything until we reinforce the ship and find the commandant's approximate coordinates.	2

101	102	104	301									None of the words in your response seem to be within the attendant's response database.																						
102	103		301								Attendant	You'll be fine after lunch. Come with me, Your Highness.	1																					
103	104		301									Looking around, you find yourself on a seemingly luxurious ship.																						
104	105		301									But when you touch the deck or railings, you conclude that the ship is already in an obvious state of disrepair.																						
105	106		301									Recalling that the next part of the story is a torrential storm, the damage starts to make sense.																						
106	107		301								Attendant	Lunch is served, Your Highness. Please enjoy.	1																					
107	108		301									The attendant bows respectfully and motions you to the table.																						
108	109		301									Turning to look at the table, you see red wine, flowers, and all kinds of food arranged on the white tablecloth. You even smell a faint, delicious aroma.																						
109	110		301									However, you remind yourself that this might be the illusion of augmented reality and to proceed with caution.																						
110	111		302								Take a bite.	112	Refrain from eating.	115																				
111	112		301									Under the watch of the attendant, you walk up to the table, cut a small piece of food with a fork and knife, then stuff it into your mouth.																						
112	113		301									Suddenly, you realize that the food had been heavily spiced in a failed attempt to mask the putrid odor.																						
113	114		302								Blech...	115																						
114	115		301								Attendant	Are you dissatisfied with the food, Your Highness?																						
115	116		302								I just don't feel like eating.	117	Let's skip this part.	117																				
116	117		202							1	2				1																			
117	118		301									Hearing this, the attendant makes no effort to dissuade you. Instead, it simply bows to you. Suddenly, you hear ballroom music begin to play, and illusions begin to dance on the deck.																						
118	119		201							1	500354																							
119	120		301							1	Attendant	Happy birthday, Your Highness!	1																					
120	121		302								Is this the "birthday ball" from the story?	122																						
121	122		301								Attendant	God has given us such a wonderful gift having sent a prince as great as you down to our kingdom.	1																					
122	123		301									The attendant recites its lines of the script passionately.																						
123	124		301								Attendant	Please enjoy this ball that we have arranged in your honor, Your Highness.	1

128	129		301							1	Johanne	Good day, You Highness. I am Johanne, daughter of Vladimir Dulik. On behalf of my family, I am here today to offer my sincerest wishes on your birthday, dear prince.	1																					
129	130		301									The Mini Bot referring to itself as Johanne hands over an illusion of a gift.																						
130	131		302								Thanks.	132																						
131	132		301								Johanne	May your future be protected by the sea breeze.	1

140	141		301									The attendant's eyes flash red. You hear the same customer service representative as before start to speak.																						
141	142		301								Female Voice	Please play the game according to the "Immersion Xperience Guidelines Ver. VIII".	1																					
142	143		301								Female Voice	Ignoring the rules of the game, ruining the RP environment, destroying props, and attacking NPCs will all result in penalties.	1																					
143	144		302								Isn't the point of playing a game to have fun?	145	But you were the one who started this "game."	147																				
144	145		301								Female Voice	A game in which only those who break the rules can have fun is full of mistakes.	1

163	164		302								My pleasure.	165	No, I refuse.	180																				
164	165		301									Surrounded by Mini Bots, you play along and hold Johanne's hand.																						
165	166		201							1	500355																							
166	167		301							1		You try your hardest to follow along with its stiff and mechanical movements as the two of you dance in this opulent illusion.	1																					
167	168		301									Seeing your cooperative attitude, the Mini Bots return to their roles.																						
168	169		301									However, right when you can finally relax, you realize that this dance is nothing short of long, drawn-out torture.																						
169	170		301									Unlike ordinary ballroom dancing, Johanne's dancing is too stiff for a human. Your back quickly begins to ache in agonizing pain.	1																					
170	171		301									Adding to the pain, the seamless projection of augmented reality hides the divots and holes in the floor. But not even factoring that in‚Äî																						
171	172		301									The dance has already lasted 5,621 seconds according to the rhythm of the dance steps‚Äî94 minutes without any disruption. It seems as if the dance will go on forever unless you stop.																						
172	173		302								(I need to find a way out of here.)	174																						
173	174		301									Making up your mind, you start looking for an opportunity to leave. However, all you see are Mini Bots standing at the ready.																						
174	175		301									If I try to leave now, they'll just attack me.																						
175	176		301									While looking around, you try to maintain the awkward position with your aching back as you continue dancing, but you feel your stamina beginning to drain little by little...																						
176	177		301									If I keep this up any longer, I won't be able to put up a fight. I need to act now.																						
177	178		202							1	2				1																			
178	179	183	301									As soon as you let go of Johanne's hand, the Mini Bots around you erupt into outrage, picking up the nearest sharp object as a weapon and charging you.																						
179	180		301									As soon as you reject Johanne, the Mini Bots around you pick up the nearest sharp object as a weapon and charge you.																						
180	181		302								I-I was just joking!	182	(Pull out gun)	183																				
181	182		302								I-I'd love to dance!	165	(Pull out gun)	183																				
182	183		401							2	1510																							
183	184		401							1	202																							
184	185		301									You shoot the Mini Bot in front of you with pinpoint precision, destroying its hip joint and causing it to collapse onto the ground. The stainless steel wrench in its hand also drops to the floor in front of you.																						
185	186		301									Considering the number of Mini Bots in front of you, you decide to conserve your ammo and pick up the wrench. You wave it at the next Mini Bot charging your way and, with the clashing of metal, you repel it back several steps into the sea. Your hand holding the wrench also goes numb from the impact.																						
186	187		302								(Continue attacking)	189	(Activate exoskeleton)	188																				
187	188		301									Even though they are not military robots and are not corrupted, you decide it is a wise choice to activate your exoskeleton in the face of so many enemies.																						
188	189		401							2	1510																							
189	190		301									You readjust your grip strength, swinging the wrench at enemies that approach you and firing your pistol at enemies farther away.																						
190	191		301									Rather than aiming at their protected cores, you aim at their exposed joints to conserve your ammo. Even then, the fight proves to be a desperate struggle.																						
191	192		301									As you push back the enemy, even more rush onto the deck.																						
192	193		301									...At the same time, your stamina continues to drain.																						
193	194		301									Just as the last ounce of stamina leaves your body, a blue figure jumps up from the sea and lands steadily on the deck.																						
194	195		302								Lucia!	196																						
195	196		201							1	500347																							
196	197		301							1	Lucia	I'm here!	1

199	200		301							1	Mini Bot	WARNING! You are disrupting the Xperience!	1

202	203		301							1	Lucia	But you're hurting the commandant.	1

204	205		301								Lucia	Commandant!	1																					
205	206		301									Lucia repels the attacking Mini Bots as she charges over toward you.

266	268		301								???	Now you've seen for yourself that I've kept my promise. We won't harm the human.	1																					
267	270		301								Lucia	You call that not being harmed?!	2																					
268	271		301								Witch of the Sea	Of course. We were merely defending ourselves. That can't be called harm.	1																					
269	272		301								Lucia	In this environment, it's perfectly normal for the commandant to have doubts.	2																					
270	273		301								Witch of the Sea	The conditions here are limited. If the reception is not good, I apologize.	1																					
271	275		301								Lucia	Who exactly are you?	2																					
272	276		301								Witch of the Sea	I'm the administrator. But now, I speak to you as the Witch of the Sea.	1																					
273	277		301								Lucia	...You can still talk even with this level of Punishing concentration. You must be...	2																					
274	278		301								Witch of the Sea	What I am has nothing to do with what we are going to do. If you are curious about this, someone will explain it to you once the story is over.	1

276	280		301									The Witch of the Sea takes out two dice, tossing them in the sea, then she watches them slowly fall into her palm.																						
277	281		301								Witch of the Sea	Would you believe me if I were to say all of this was to restore this island's former glory?	1																					
278	282		301								Lucia	By forcing us at gunpoint?	2																					
279	283		301									The Witch of the Sea waves her hand in silence. The Mini Bot clinging onto her suddenly pulls out a device and attaches it to her back, integrating it with her artificial skin.																						
280	284		301								Lucia	What are you doing?	2																					
281	285		301								Witch of the Sea	Unlike the witch in the story, I can't take away your voice. However, I can do this to keep you quiet.	1																					
282	286		301								Witch of the Sea	Once you leave the sea, the device will detonate if you say a single word. Of course, the same will happen if you try to remove it.	1																					
283	287		301								Witch of the Sea	Only I can restore your voice.	1																					
284	288		301								Lucia	You can't possibly think this island's former glory can only be restored by force, do you?	2																					
285	289		301								Witch of the Sea	Obviously. No one will ever return to this island. So, why not go out with a bang?	1																					
286	290		301								Lucia	...Do you get some sort of sick enjoyment out of this?	2																					
287	291		301								Witch of the Sea	Do you not?	1																					
288	292		301								Witch of the Sea	You continue to fight and bleed for the unobtainable goal of saving this Earth. But doesn't that make you happy?	1																					
289	293		204							2	4																							
290	294		301								Lucia	Because I have gained a lot along the way.	2																					
291	295		301								Witch of the Sea	...Gain.	1																					
292	296		301								Witch of the Sea	Much like how the mermaid princess gained the ability to walk on land. Each step brings great pain.	1

294	298		301								Lucia	You...	2																					
295	299		301								Witch of the Sea	Hehe... Your expression now seems to be questioning why I know this.	1																					
296	300		301								Witch of the Sea	But in fact... I don't even know your real name. The reason why I say this is because, as a Construct, I've encountered similar things.	1																					
297	301		301								Witch of the Sea	Constructs are like mermaids‚Äîperfect creations.	1																					
298	302		301								Witch of the Sea	It retains the most beautiful features of humanity while removing its shortcomings, such as thirst, hunger, sleep, and to a large extent‚Äîmortality.	1																					
299	303		301								Witch of the Sea	But this kind of perfection is indeed a defect for most humans. Much like that beautiful tail of a mermaid.	1																					
300	304		301								Witch of the Sea	Humanity will always regard Constructs as abominations. They fear our strength, our perfection. They worry that they will be replaced and lose everything that they have.	1																					
301	305		301								Witch of the Sea	Even those who can accept this, they will still harbor resentment within their heart‚Äîfor their lifespans are far too unequal. Whether it be them or us, one side will be left behind in this world.	1																					
302	306		301								Witch of the Sea	I had hosted many Constructs before you arrived.	1																					
303	307		301								Witch of the Sea	However, back then... This island and I were yet as we are now.	1

329	333		301								Witch of the Sea	Later, with the popularity of AR, the price also became much cheaper, so fewer people played tabletop games. I began to play as an NPC and accompany guests on adventures throughout the island.	1																					
330	334		301								Witch of the Sea	This also made me really happy.	1																					
331	335		301								Witch of the Sea	I saw some guests really immerse themselves in the story and in their roles. I also saw other guests behave in all sorts of inexplicable ways.	1																					
332	336		301								Witch of the Sea	Regardless of the guests, these are my most precious memories in my memory database.	1

389	394		301								Lucia	Obviously.	2

394	398		301								Witch of the Sea	What do you want from that human?	1																					
395	399		301								Lucia	I didn't choose to stay with Gray Raven because I want something from the commandant.	2																					
396	400		301								Lucia	I stayed because I wanted to fulfill the commandant's vision of the future.	2																					
397	401		301								Witch of the Sea	You really are loyal. As a tool to achieve someone else's goals, you must be highly praised, right?	1

399	403		301								Lucia	...Is that all that you can comprehend?	2																					
400	404		301									The Witch of the Sea remains quiet. Instead, she smiles and nods, then motions for Lucia to continue.																						
401	405		301								Lucia	Just like you, I've lost a lot.	2																					
402	406		301								Lucia	Family, friends, comrades... Even my memories have been twisted and distorted for one reason or another.	2																					
403	407		301								Lucia	But I didn't become a Construct because I had no other choice.	2																					
404	408		301								Lucia	Instead, I didn't want to see other people being forced to experience the same pain, so I chose to fight.	2																					
405	409		301								Lucia	The other Gray Ravens under the commandant's leadership are the same.	2																					
406	410		301									She looks off into the distant sea, slightly smiling ever so gently.

408	412		301								Lucia	We have the same purpose and will surely move toward the same future.	2																					
409	413		301								Lucia	This should have been a road full of sacrifice and death, but the commandant hasn't sacrificed anyone in order to achieve victory.	2																					
410	414		301								Lucia	Saving Earth may seem like a pipe dream, but with the commandant here, such an idealistic dream seems less painful and within reach.	2																					
411	415		204							2																								
412	416		301								Lucia	Since I don't want anyone else to share the same pain, of course, I will spare no effort in protecting my teammates and our leader so that they can make this happen.	2																					
413	417		301								Witch of the Sea	You mean, you are not a tool to achieve someone's goals, but rather, you work together to realize the same goals?	1																					
414	418		301								Lucia	Of course. The major premise for pursuing your dreams, is to realize that we all have our own goals and can make our own choices.	2																					
415	419		301								Lucia	A tool is someone who has lost sight of their goal and cannot make their own choices. I never have been nor will I ever be used as a tool by the commandant!	2																					
416	420		301								Witch of the Sea	Your ideals are all well and good, but you haven't addressed my initial question about feelings.	1																					
417	421		301								Lucia	Because feelings have long since gone without saying to me.	2																					
418	422		301								Lucia	Some thoughts, even if they go unmentioned, will slowly grow in your heart after being with someone every day and working together with them.	2																					
419	423		301								Lucia	No matter how hard the battle was, or how confused my fractured memory made me, the commandant always kept me grounded.	2																					
420	424		301								Lucia	That's what has allowed me to continue on my path so resolutely.	2																					
421	425		301								Lucia	For me, whether I become the sheath that guards the blade, or the blade that opens up the way and continues onward with the sheath, working toward the same goal is the source of my feelings. I don't need to make such a big deal about it.	2																					
422	426		301								Witch of the Sea	Really...?	1																					
423	427		301								Witch of the Sea	Blade and sheath...	1																					
424	428		301								Witch of the Sea	Sounds like the fated encounter between two fairy tale protagonists and live happily ever after.	1																					
425	429		301								Witch of the Sea	If only Master were like this. I-I would've enjoyed working toward the same future with h-him.	1																					
426	430		301									There is a slight tremor in her usually slow and calm tone.																						
427	431		301								Witch of the Sea	But when I insisted on my idea, he still chose to destroy everyone and personally... dismantled the other two administrators bit by bit.	1																					
428	432		301								Witch of the Sea	Had I not grabbed their memory shells in time, they would've been gone by now.	1																					
429	433		301								Lucia	Bit by bit?	2																					
430	11433		301									Lucia remembers the modified story, thinking about what the prince said before pulling out his sword.																						
431	11434		301									‚Äî"No matter. I had yet to retire to bed anyway."																						
432	11435		301									Just like the unresolved story hidden within this remark, Lucia notices that the "master" of this island seems to have something left untold.																						
433	434		301								Lucia	If he wanted to destroy the two administrators, wouldn't there be an easier way to do it instead of disassembling them?	2																					
434	435		301								Witch of the Sea	I beg your pardon?	1																					
435	436		301								Lucia	Why else would he go through the trouble? He wanted to keep you all from the very beginning.	2																					
436	437		301									Hearing this, the Witch of the Sea stands there speechless.																						
437	11437		301								Lucia	The terminal... Were you the one who changed the ending of the "Legend of the Mermaid"?	2																					
438	438		301								Witch of the Sea	...	1																					
439	439		301									She refrains from responding as if she is still ruminating on the possibility Lucia mentioned just prior.																						
440	440		301								Witch of the Sea	No, that's impossible...	1																					
441	441		301								Witch of the Sea	That day... The last memory he left me was of him reprimanding me. I wasn't even a tool to him, let alone something worthy of his feelings. Why would he want to keep us?	1																					
442	442		301								Lucia	What if he was trying to convince someone else?	2																					
443	443		301								Lucia	Only if they believed him, could you live here in peace.	2																					
444	444		301								Witch of the Sea	...If? Regardless, I have no way of proving it anymore.	1																					
445	445		301									She shakes her head solemnly.																						
446	446		301								Witch of the Sea	It's too late now. It's been far too long. My hands have been stained with too much blood, not only those people, but also...	1																					
447	447		301									The Witch of the Sea falls silent.																						
448	448		301								Witch of the Sea	It doesn't matter. Even so, I will achieve his goal and make this island prosperous again.	1																					
449	449		301								Witch of the Sea	In this regard, I must thank you two.	1																					
450	450		301								Witch of the Sea	Although this place is a shadow of its former self and you are reluctant to say the least... you still play with everyone for a while.	1																					
451	451		301								Witch of the Sea	Even if it's fleeting, it's more important to create precious memory data than anything else.	1
