6	6		301								Bruce	The mass outbreak of the virus... The front lines probably don't look good if they're recruiting trainees like us...	2																					
7	7		301								Watanabe	You still want to fight on the front lines?	1																					
8	8		301								Watanabe	Look at our gear, the armory...	1

26	26		301								Bruce	The virus' here...	2																					
27	27		301								Watanabe	What?!	1																					
28	28		301								Bruce	We need to position the troops immediately. The outbreak started north of the plains... There are probably quite a lot of civilians trapped.	2																					
29	29		301								Bruce	HQ wants us to hold the line here, and also to send a rescue team out to the plains.	2																					
30	30		301								Watanabe	...Are they telling us to go die?!	1
