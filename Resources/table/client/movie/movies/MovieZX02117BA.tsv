3	3		301			DialogEnable						The city is about to sink, and this is when the storm stops.																						
4	4		301									You look out, and the city is gone. The horizon reverts to a flat plane, the top of the six spires now tiny dots, barely noticeable. Even the tallest main city is fully submerged, save for the roof of the observatory.																						
5	5		301									The wind howls, and the waves rumble.																						
6	6		301									With one hand on her banner spear, Vera half-kneels, half-sits on the floor.																						
7	7		301									She was going to overpower Lamia and subdue her, whatever it took to drag her back to the control panel, so she could force her to disable the submergence command.																						
8	8		301									But Lamia still ran away in the end.																						
9	9		301									All Vera feels now is tiredness and frustration.																						
10	10		301									How strange she was willing to go this far, she thinks to herself. Uncharacteristically, she does not have an answer immediately. This is very unlike her—she has not been this apprehensive for a long time.																						
11	11		301									She has protected her target and retrieved the objective. She did not need to spend the extra effort in this place, and yet.																						
12	12		301									What is done is done. She is too proud to need an explanation for her actions.																						
13	13		301									A conqueror does not justify herself. Everything is instinctual.																						
14	14		301									Suddenly, the loud whirring sound of engines appears in the distant sky.																						
15	15		301									Struggling, Vera looks up and finds a tiny black dot approaching—a transport craft, but not one of Kurono's.																						
16	16		301									It is a Babylonia transport craft, with the logo of Gray Raven on its wings.

22	22		301			RImgBg1Shake						Another quake from beneath her feet.																						
23	23		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Just like the first time when the city started sinking, this one is also earth-shattering.																						
24	24		503							10021																								
25	25		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Before Vera can react—before she can even register what is happening—the city begins to rise at a high speed. Covered in water, it baths in the reflection of the sun.																						
26	26		301									For a second, it no longer is a graveyard.																						
27	27		301									The ocean has cleansed it of its malady. Underneath the sun now stands the lighthouse of human civilization from eons past.																						
28	28		301									Vera closes her eyes.																						
29	29		301									She recalls a way to measure time she once heard.																						
30	30		301									The universe is 13.8 billion years old. If you compress this period of time into 12 months, then the history of humankind begins on the last night of the year.																						
31	31		301									On that last night, which is 3.5 million years ago, the first hominin stood up, and instead of looking at the earth, it looked to the stars.																						
32	32		301									It takes 60 seconds from humans understanding seasons by observing the stars to the first astronaut planting his flag on the moon.																						
33	33		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					And humankind's current obstacle, the Punishing Virus, is but a blip in the grand scheme of things.

35	35		401							1	17																							
36	36		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Showered in sunlight, Vera walks up, her eyes opened wide, looking directly at the sun.																						
37	37		301									She can almost see the woman's figure against the glare of the sun. She reaches out a hand.																						
38	38		301									She can almost touch it, the world a second in the future.																						
39	39		301									Like the astronaut on Apollo 11 planting his flag on the moon, Vera plants her banner spear by her side.																						
40	40		301									It is an act of ancient, primal instinct, claiming her territory.																						
41	41		301									When their first ship entered orbit, they declared earth theirs.																						
42	42		301									When their flag was planted on the moon, they declared the moon theirs.																						
43	43		301									Humans will not stop conquering.																						
44	44		301									Centuries after humans conquered the moon, those from Babylonia...																						
45	45		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					...They have "conquered" earth again.

48	48		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				One more thing. This is just my view and some guesses. I didn't want to leave it in this recording at first.	ffffffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory421.jpg		1																			
49	49		304							But a good, educated guess is no less valuable than a clear conclusion.	ffffffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory421.jpg		1																			
50	50		304							Unfortunately, I don't have time to prove its validity. So I'll leave it to you, seekers of tomorrow.	ffffffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory421.jpg		1																			
51	51		304							Maybe this will help your work.	ffffffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory421.jpg		1																			
52	52		304							I've been thinking about the "logic" behind the Punishing Virus' appearance. I doubt the zero-point energy itself could create the virus.	ffffffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory421.jpg		1																			
53	53		304							There are no laws of physics that support this emergence.	ffffffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory421.jpg		1

57	57		304							As far as we can tell, the zero-point energy is a crucial condition for the Punishing Virus' existence.	ffffffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory421.jpg		1																			
58	58		304							But, personally, I prefer the theory that zero-point energy opened a pathway instead of creating the virus.	ffffffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory421.jpg		1		1																	
59	59		304							The zero-point reactor is a product of extremely complicated, advanced physics and mathematics. 	ffffffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory421.jpg		1																			
60	60		304							On the other hand, the more advanced the technology is, the more susceptible it is to the Punishing Virus.	ffffffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory421.jpg		1																			
61	61		304							That is to say, a primitive civilization wouldn't have a chance to encounter it. 	ffffffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory421.jpg		1																			
62	62		304							The Punishing Virus wouldn't have crawled out of a furnace or a steam engine.	ffffffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory421.jpg		1																			
63	63		304							Even if they did encounter it, as long as there was no electricity or digital devices, the Punishing Virus wouldn't have made a dent.	ffffffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory421.jpg		1																			
64	64		304							The logical conclusion is obvious: the Punishing Virus targets highly advanced civilizations.	ffffffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory421.jpg		1																			
65	65		304							It grows in a civilization like a parasite to keep it in check. And if the civilization is too sick to heal, it dies.	ffffffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory421.jpg		1

67	67		304							I don't have any proof, obviously. I haven't observed any other civilizations that were hit by the Punishing Virus. Our only sample is humankind.	ffffffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory421.jpg		1
