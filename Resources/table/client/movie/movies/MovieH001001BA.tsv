80	80		301								Liv	You know, doing things that makes us happy?	1																					
81	81		301								Liv	At a place we like... In the company of friends... Wearing our favorite coatings... Free from worrying about missions or fighting.	1

85	85		301									Remembering the mission, her expression becomes serious again.																						
86	86		301								Liv	But that's also why we need to take a break every once in a while. Only then can we fight at peak performance.	1

88	88		301								Lucia	Every once in a while...?	2																					
89	89		301								Liv	Yep! That reminds me... You haven't changed coatings in ages, have you, Lucia?	1																					
90	90		301								Lucia	Coatings don't seem to affect my performance in battle, so I haven't noticed.	2

96	96		302								Ahem...	97	Oh, about that...	97																				
97	97		301								Liv	The commandant actually spoke with me about that already...	1																					
98	98		301								Lucia	About coatings?	2																					
99	99		301								Liv	Yep! The commandant wants to give you a new coating!	1																					
100	100		301								Lucia	...Me?	2																					
101	101		301								Liv	Yep! But we decided that...	1																					
102	102		302								You should pick one out yourself!	103																						
103	103		301								Liv	After all, you're always so tight-lipped about what kind of coating you like.	1																					
104	104		301								Liv	So, you should pick one out yourself.	1																					
105	105		301									Liv takes out her terminal. She opens up a window and shows it to Lucia—revealing dozens of coatings waiting to be tried on.																						
106	106		301								Liv	These are all the test coatings we applied for. Pick whichever one you like the best!	1																					
107	107		301									At a loss, Lucia approaches Liv's terminal and flips through the selection under the behest of her excitement.																						
108	108		301								Liv	Look! This coating comes in a dress!	1																					
109	109		301									She points to a lavish but ungainly coating inspired by Rococo fashion.																						
110	110		301								Lucia	I don't think this would be very suitable for combat...	2																					
111	111		301									Liv nods seriously as they both turn the page.																						
112	112		301								Liv	What about this one? It's a simple red uniform and a matching skirt.	1																					
113	113		301								Liv	Um, but... There's not much of a difference. Is there?	1																					
114	114		301								Lucia	You're right.	2																					
115	115		301									The two of them quickly skip over several coatings of that style.																						
116	116		301								Liv	What about a sailor outfit? That goes well with summer.	1																					
117	117		204							2	6																							
118	118		301								Lucia	...A sailor outfit? But it's pink...	2

120	120		204							2	2																							
121	121		301								Lucia	But I admit, summer feels rather nice.	2																					
122	122		301								Liv	How about this one? What do you think?	1																					
123	123		301									Liv points to a breathable swimsuit and grins. Lucia's face instantly turns a bright cherry red.																						
124	124		204							2	6																							
125	125		301								Lucia	No, no, no... Absolutely not.	2

127	127		301									She quickly turns to the next page and continues browsing.																						
128	128		301								Lucia	...How about this one?	2																					
129	129		301									Lucia points to an icy blue summer coating with soft scales resembling a fish tail. One of the legs looks like a trail of seafoam left by a wave on the beach.																						
130	130		301								Liv	Wow, that's gorgeous. Want to try it out?	1																					
131	131		301								Lucia	...Right now?	2

151	151		301								Liv	(Lucia might not seem like she cares about this kind of thing, but she cares about your opinion... Now's not the time for games.)	1																					
152	152		302								Sorry.	153	...	153

162	162		301									Gently raising her hands, she looks down at her soft, delicate skirt and her shimmering hair resting on her shoulders.																						
163	163		301								Liv	Your hair sure brings back memories.	1																					
164	164		302								Yeah.	165	...	165																				
165	165		301								Liv	Think it'll be more convenient to have your hair tied up?	1																					
166	166		204							2	1																							
167	167		301								Lucia	I'm used to fighting like this. My first frame had the same hairstyle.	2																					
168	168		301								Liv	That's good to know.	1																					
169	169		301								Liv	Well then, let's submit a request for this coating.	1																					
170	170		301								Liv	From the description, it's based on the "Legend of the Mermaid".	1
