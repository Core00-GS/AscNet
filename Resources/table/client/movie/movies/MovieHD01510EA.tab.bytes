91	91		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	Critical success. Commandant performs an emergency brake, followed by a somersault and a perfect landing.																						
92	92		301									But all the available attributes show that Gray Raven and Strike Hawk have exhausted all their strength.																						
93	93		201							1	500001																							
94	94		301							1	Celica	I must give kudos to you, Task Force. Even if this is only the calculated result of a game program, your coordination is flawless.	1

122	122		301								Celica	Wait, I spent a lot of time preparing this finishing move.	1																					
123	123		301								Celica	You can't do this to me! Stop!	1																					
124	124		301								Celica	At least give me a proper ending! I'm the Overlord! I don't want to appear in the script like this!	1

158	158		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You are standing in a corridor of WGAA. Ayla takes out two cans of drinks from a vintage drink machine and hands one to you.																						
159	159		302								I never knew WGAA had such a device.	160																						
160	160		201							1	500110																							
161	161		301							1	Ayla	Oh, it was only recently restored, so we placed it here.	1																					
162	162		301								Ayla	Such devices were created in the Golden Age or even earlier. WGAA loves to see them in use.	1																					
163	163		301									You pull the ring on the can's lid. The aroma of the soda drink immediately flows out.																						
164	164		301									Ayla looks around to confirm there is no one else...																						
165	165		301								Ayla	Commandant, do you think it was logical for Task Force and Engineering Force to move separately in the game just now?	1																					
166	166		302								Why do you suddenly bring this topic up?	167																						
167	167		301								Ayla	Remember I was checking on Karenina earlier? Took me a lot of effort because I wasn't familiar with the landscape.	1																					
168	168		301								Ayla	But maybe it's just my wishful thinking. After all, I'm not a member of the Task Force, and my understanding of tactics is limited to creative works only.	1																					
169	169		302								Where do you think the problem is then?	170																						
170	170		301								Ayla	Since I'm talking to you, Commandant, I'll just be frank.	1																					
171	171		301								Ayla	The Engineering Force had made an appearance previously, so it was only logical for them to challenge Celica. Gray Raven should be going to the artifact chamber instead because they had never shown up in the capital.	1																					
172	172		301								Ayla	No matter how well Karenina and Teddy could work together, it was too dangerous for them to go alone.	1																					
173	173		302								That was quite risky indeed.	174																						
174	174		301								Ayla	But Karenina also had a point. Maybe she just didn't think that much given it was only a game.	1																					
175	175		301								Ayla	Gargh! There are so many things I need to consider!	1																					
176	176		302								Why are you so concerned?	177																						
177	177		301								Ayla	What I fear most is, none of my guesses were correct. They just prefer to stay with those from their own squads.	1																					
178	178		302								...	179																						
179	179		301								Ayla	I'm not saying that there is a problem. But each time I try to ask them for opinions, they always tell me they want to spend holidays with their own squads. It just makes me feel a little... lonely?	1																					
180	180		302								What do you want to do then, Ayla?	181																						
181	181		301								Ayla	Hmm... I think we can try to make some changes!	1																					
182	182		204							1	1																							
183	183		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Ayla	That's why I have a favor to ask you...	1
