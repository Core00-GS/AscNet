234	234		301								???	Right. Thank you.	2																					
235	235		301								Rachel	No worries. The world might be a mess now, but knowledge will still pay off in the long run.	1																					
236	236		301								Rachel	Make sure you read and learn a whole bunch of things in there.	1

238	238		301								Rachel	And try to be nicer to your mom. You see, she's just trying to help because...	1

243	243		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The boy never dares to ask what Rachel was going to say.																						
244	244		301									After Rachel's talk with the young boy's mother, he now has four hours' worth of "work" to do for the Maintenance Crew outside of chores and studying.																						
245	245		301									At home, he pays close attention to his mother's tone, and he works and studies harder than ever—to keep his mother in the dark.																						
246	246		301									Once he's back at the storage with all the books, he becomes a fish swimming freely across a sea of books, all the while absorbing all the nutrients it provides.																						
247	247		301									This place shelters him from everything—be it his mother, or the venom that spews out of people's mouths when they mouth off his mother.																						
248	248		301									Many find books like these too impractical for kids' good.																						
249	249		301									But to someone like him—someone born on and confined to a train—these books are his only chance to learn about the world out there.																						
250	250		301									He might not own these books, but he's confident that he knows what's in these books better than the one who owns them.																						
251	251		301									Be it the Golden Age, the ever-expanding universe, or the romance and tears—he remembers every single story he's read.																						
252	252		301									A story he remembers particularly well is one where the protagonist vows to fight for justice and an ideal world, and how the world is actually fixed in the end.																						
253	253		301									In the countless stories he's read, people stop hurting one another to survive—rather, they work as one to rebuild their home.																						
254	254		301									Repenting or not, the bad guys pay for what they've done.																						
255	255		301									Through these stories, he gradually comes to grasp with his place on the train—and why it's important to fight oppression back.

257	257		301							1	???	If someone could really make it happen, then this place would probably change like the world does from the stories...	1																					
258	258		301									With the book in his hands, the boy makes a wish to himself—he wants to become someone like the hero from the stories, someone who fights for "justice"...																						
259	259		204							1	3																							
260	260		301								???	In fact, he thinks he would probably be happy to just fight alongside the hero.	1																					
261	261		301									Again and again, the boy would dream of being the hero that comes to the world's rescue—yet it soon wears away when his mother comes down hard on him.																						
262	262		301									She has criticized him in more ways than one, putting all sorts of labels on his dream—eventually, the boy loses ground.																						
263	263		204							1	14																							
264	264		301								???	...It's probably high time that I faced the music.	1																					
265	265		301								???	Mom is probably going to be mad again if I pick fights with the kids.	1																					
266	266		301									Deciding to compromise with reality, the boy comes up with an action plan—in which he secretly stores away his dream.																						
267	267		204							1	5																							
268	268		301								???	I'm sure Mom is going to be okay with me drawing when the train is once again peaceful and I've learned how to keep my head above water.	1																					
269	269		301								???	But for now, I guess I'll just do as Mom and Rachel say and help around the house.	1																					
270	270		301									And life goes on, as the boy holds on to his flimsy little dream and goes through all the emotional ups and downs that come with it.																						
271	271		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Life hasn't been exactly easy growing up, what with all the pressures and his futile resistance against them—yet here he is, ready to turn 11.
