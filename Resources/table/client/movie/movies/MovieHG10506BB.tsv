12	11		301								Nanami	You see, when the Earth is reclaimed, everyone will be free! It won't be too late for my research!	2																					
13	12		301								Lee	The war's not looking good for us though. And before that time comes, can you promise that you'll never cause trouble again like last time out of selfishness?	1																					
14	13		301								Nanami	Nanami's not selfish... It's just the time limit of the mission...	2																					
15	14		301								Lee	Time limit?	1																					
16	15		301								Lee	I don't know when that limit is, but isn't that all the more reason for you to finish your research as soon as possible?	1																					
17	16		301								Nanami	But... but Nanami doesn't want to leave Commandant!	2																					
18	102		302								I don't want Nanami to leave either!	17	Lee, don't let Nanami leave!	17

28	23		301								Nanami	But Nanami will try her best starting from today.	2																					
29	24		301								Nanami	Whether it's battles, daily tasks, or other missions, Nanami will take care of them all before the time limit!	2																					
30	25		301								Nanami	In return, please become Nanami's finest research subject, Commandant.	2																					
31	26		301								Nanami	Humans live in groups, and there are bound to be excellent individuals in a group.	2																					
32	27		301								Nanami	And that individual is the most important research subject! At least that's what Nanami thinks.	2																					
33	104		302								What are you talking about?	28	Are you talking about me?	29																				
34	28	30	301								Nanami	What Nanami means to say is, please become the most outstanding human, Commandant!	2																					
35	29	30	301								Nanami	Hehe! That's right!	2
