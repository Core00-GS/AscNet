26	25		301									The sudden warnings pulled the two pilots back to reality. The pilot in the driver's seat immediately got up and tapped on the electronic screen. Soon the outside of the transport craft was displayed on the home screen in front of them.																						
27	26		301								Pilot A	Hey, what is this flying in?

32	31		301								Pilot B	How is that possible... We're in the ionosphere already, since when can the Corrupted attack in such range?																						
33	32		301									To slow down the fall, the pilot near the control console desperately pushed the steering lever with his right hand while shouting loudly at the communicator in his left hand.
