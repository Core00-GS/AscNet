5	3		301			DialogEnable						Overcoming countless adversities and witnessing just as many lay down their lives, the intrepid heroes continue to search for hope on this most harrowing journey.																						
6	4		301									Most people did not know that this journey would be unworthy of adulation. From the moment they set forth, they were doomed to a life entangled in shadows.																						
7	5		301									Reading this file enshrouded with deceit, the names of these heroes remain unknown.																						
8	6		301									Perhaps... we only survived because we knew nothing.

10	8		301							1	Lucia	...	1																					
11	9		301									Lucia swipes her battle log lost in thought, stopping at a location on Earth surrounded by ruins.																						
12	10		301									On a wall of the ruins, she sees a mysterious piece of synthetic paper containing this excerpt from an unknown novel.																						
13	11		301								Lucia	This most harrowing journey...	1																					
14	12		202							1					1																			
15	13		301									After completing their underground mission at City 075 and installing the bit domain nodes, Gray Raven had already returned to Babylonia for several days now.																						
16	14		301									However, Lucia remains in the preparation room reviewing training material from the battle log database only because their new mission had ordered them to remain here on standby.																						
17	15		301									Although such respite is a luxury, the fact that everyone else is working double duty while only Gray Raven sits idly in the preparation room requires no further explanation.																						
18	1000		201							1	500166	5																						
19	1001		301							1	Lucia	Seems like the decision to postpone the investigation on the commandant's insubordination has to do with more pressing military concerns...	1																					
20	1002		202							1					1																			
21	16		301									You have tried to apply for other missions and even spoke with previous contacts. Regardless, the response across the board was just "take a few days off."																						
22	17		301									But even when the team tried to go out and enjoy this much needed R&R together, they were met with a sneaking suspicion.																						
23	18		301									Whether it was the dubious behavior of people in the plaza or cameras following them as they passed by, they all silently stated the same fact.																						
24	19		301									—They were prisoners in a cage.																						
25	20		301									Confirming this, you order everyone to return to the preparation room.																						
26	21		301									The team had planned on discussing the current state of events in a more familiar setting, but upon returning to the preparation room after their brief outing, they found that the weapon reserves had miraculously disappeared. Only some basic equipment and daily necessities remained.																						
27	22		301									Just as you go to ask the staff about the situation in the preparation room, you are escorted away and have yet to return.																						
28	23		201							1	500166	5																						
29	24		301							1	Lucia	It's been almost two whole days now...	1																					
30	25		301									Lucia looks at the clock on the bottom of the terminal, frowning slightly.																						
31	26		202							1					1																			
32	27		301									..."We need to monitor memory replays caused by the corrupted Mind Beacon."																						
33	28		301									This is what one of the unfamiliar personnel had said to her as they escorted you away.																						
34	29		301									Lucia wants to accompany you or at least keep an eye from a distance, but the personnel comes prepared. As soon as she opens her mouth, one of them suddenly drops a large stack of inspection reports and work certificates in front of her, the contents of which contain a series of stringent terms and warnings.

40	36		301								Liv	Yeah...	2																					
41	37		301								Liv	Not like I disagree with any of it. They're not trying to pull the wool over our eyes.	2																					
42	38		301								Liv	They're just putting extra emphasis on some... possibly dangerous symptoms...	2																					
43	39		301								Liv	There's no need for more medical treatment without any signs of symptoms, but they are within reason to monitor the commandant's condition.	2																					
44	40		301								Lee	I'm not talking about the contents of the report. I meant the doctor's signature—Kugawa.	1																					
45	41		301								Lee	Even though it's just a first name, I've seen his handwriting in the database.	1																					
46	42		301								Lee	Kugawa had already joined Kurono as a doctor during the Great Evacuation.	1																					
47	43		301								Lee	Now that Kurono is a part of Babylonia, he rarely makes his presence known.	1																					
48	44		301								Lee	Even still, their bond is unbreakable. They carry out covert operations to this very day.	1																					
49	45		301								Liv	Do you think him being assigned as the commandant's doctor is a coincidence?	2																					
50	46		301								Lee	If that's the case, there should still be a familiar face or two among the people that took the commandant away.	1																					
51	47		301								Lee	Not to mention... Even if that wasn't the case, neither the President nor Celica gave us cause for alarm.	1																					
52	48		301								Lee	That would mean something is prohibiting them from making a move for the time being.	1

60	57		301									As she reads the passage silently, images from her battle with Alpha fill her M.I.N.D.																						
61	58		301									That was when you chose to trust her...																						
62	59		301									That was when she saw fragments of Alpha's memory as their M.I.N.D.s merged.																						
63	60		301									That was when she finally saw her suppressed memories—and the truth.																						
64	61		201							1	500166	5																						
65	62		301							1	Lucia	...The truth?	1																					
66	63		202							1					1

68	65		301									Who has not experienced something like this?																						
69	66		301									Even if you remember the entire conversation you had with someone, you have no way to peer into their heart to understand the true meaning behind their words.																						
70	67		301									Even if you fully restore the many paintings of your memories, you have no way of knowing what lies beneath the thick layers of paint.																						
71	68		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					As for the whole truth, she still remains uncertain. However, based on what Alpha said...

82	81		301									Quietly muttering to herself, she meticulously recalls the memory fragments that Alpha had left in her M.I.N.D. and attempts to place the puzzle pieces into her memory.																						
83	82		301								Lucia	...Ever since I became a Construct, I thought Luna was dead.	1																					
84	83		301									She opens the notepad on the screen and organizes her thoughts while jotting down a few keywords.																						
85	84		301								Lucia	I only recently found out that Luna is still alive. Seeing that Alpha stands at her side as an Ascendant...	1																					
86	85		301									Lucia writes in her notes, "Alpha was likely discovered by Luna when she was suffering from severe Punishing corruption. That's when she became an Ascendant."																						
87	86		301								Lucia	But based on my understanding of "me"... The choice to become an Ascendant is not made out of seeking vengeance or power.	1																					
88	87		301								Lucia	Was it because she couldn't return to Babylonia? Or was it because she saw Luna again?	1																					
89	88		301								Lucia	There are other possibilities, of course. But nothing substantial enough to steer "me" down that path.	1																					
90	89		301								Lucia	I'm sure the "me" back then must have believed that becoming an Ascendant would lead to a better tomorrow.	1																					
91	90		301								Lucia	After all, if she was suffering from such severe Punishing corruption, her only options were to become an Ascendant or join the horde of Corrupted.	1																					
92	91		301								Lucia	That must be it. Her choice must have been made on the basis of numerous factors pushing her down the opposite path.	1																					
93	92		301								Lucia	If she is calling this the starting point... What's next?	1																					
94	93		301									She searches the information from the memory fragments in her mind and recalls Alpha's voice as she calls out to her comrades.																						
95	94		301								Lucia	Murol, Xun... and Hiro...	1																					
96	95		202							1					1																			
97	96		301									She tried looking for them before she regained her memories due to an uneasy feeling. She has attempted to trace the whereabouts of her three comrades...																						
98	97		301									...Only to discover that their names had been registered among a list of martyrs with the chilling description of "Perished in the fight against the Corrupted".																						
99	98		301									And that was it. The trail went cold before it even began.																						
100	99		401							2	1516																							
101	100		301									While Lucia is deep in thought, a stern expression covers Liv's face as she suddenly strokes a lock of hair on the right side of Lucia's head with her fingertips.																						
102	101		301									After seeing this peculiar gesture, Lucia quietly moves the screen to cover her notes with the battle records. Lee has his head down as if concentrating on the thing in his hand, but his gaze is firmly fixed on the doorway.																						
103	102		301									The guards have changed seventeen times since this morning. Whether or not this is due to precautions made by the trio, the guards have yet to enter.																						
104	103		301									Shortly after you left yesterday, they received an anonymous encrypted message on Lee's terminal.																						
105	104		301									"Speak carefully, act cautiously. Refrain from doing anything for now. Wait until daylight to inspect the room."																						
106	105		301									The trio is suspicious at first, but given previous events, they are not entirely in disbelief.																						
107	106		301									In the morning, the group had "cleaned" the room. Doing so, they uncovered several bugs that were planted by an intruder. Only then was their remaining disbelief abated.																						
108	107		301									Lee has quietly moved some storage crates to specific positions in the corners while Liv has draped your coat in a peculiar spot.																						
109	108		301									Once the corners with those little "gifts" had been blocked, guards began showing up at the door out of nowhere.																						
110	109		301									After the trio discusses quietly amongst themselves, they decide to remain in the preparation room and "rest." That way, they will not draw any suspicion while they wait for you to return.																						
111	110		301									"We only survived because we knew nothing."																						
112	111		201							1	500166	5																						
113	112		301							1	Lucia	Why is this happening?	1																					
114	113		301								Lucia	Because the commandant violated military orders during the last mission? But they said they weren't going to look into that for the time being. Is this just an excuse to buy time?	1																					
115	114		301								Lucia	Do people really think we just let Luna go and that we're keeping her whereabouts a secret?	1																					
116	115		202							1					1																			
117	116		301									Even if Hassen and Nikola thought it was necessary to deal with it now while the war still rages on, they would have chosen a more appropriate method to go about all this.																						
118	117		301									At the very least, an arrest warrant would have been served rather than letting the commandant be taken away by those people on the grounds of "monitoring."																						
119	118		301									But there has been nothing of the sort ever since this all started.																						
120	119		301									Perhaps it is as Lee has mentioned. They are also trapped in an invisible web and need to be even more cautious than the Gray Ravens "resting" in the preparation room.																						
121	120		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					If that's the case, what does this web known as "Kurono" want from the commandant?

132	133		301								Lucia	Alpha...	1																					
133	134		301									Suddenly, a familiar voice in the corridor greets the unknown "inspector" standing outside the door. However, the door between them makes it hard to discern who the voice belongs to.																						
134	135		204							1																								
135	136		301								Lucia	...Murray?	1																					
136	137		202							1					1

138	139		201							1	500166	5																						
139	140		301							1	Lucia	Murray is speaking with the inspector... Maybe they know each other?	1																					
140	141		202							1					1																			
141	142		301									Lucia asks as she turns up her audio module sensitivity slightly.																						
142	143		301								Murray	Hey, fancy seeing you here. Are you guys here to... Cough—um... What are you up to today?																						
143	144		301									Even though the trio cannot see what is going on outside, they can hear the contemplation in his voice as if someone is stopping him from saying too much.																						
144	145		201							1	500166	5																						
145	146		301							1	Lucia	Sounds like the person standing outside is just someone following orders.	1																					
146	147		202							1					1																			
147	148		301									Her judgment is not based on her personal understanding of Murray, but on her common understanding of the position.																						
148	149		301									Lucia listens to the conversation outside closely in an attempt to pick up any clues from the casual remarks.																						
149	150		301								Murray	Sorry, am I interrupting your conversation with someone? After all, you look...																						
150	151		301								Murray	Oh, you only report if anything happens. Gotcha. I just didn't want to interfere with your work.																						
151	152		201							1	500166	5																						
152	153		301							1	Lucia	Looks like he's just a scout.	1																					
153	154		202							1					1																			
154	155		301									The other party lowers his voice and says something to Murray that even her sensitive audio module cannot pick up. Perhaps, he only mouthed a response or made a gesture.																						
155	156		301								Murray	Of course! Glad I'm not bothering you. You guys have been working late the last two days. When are you off?																						
156	157		301									The man outside the door responds quietly to which Murray gives a genial and polite laugh.																						
157	158		301								Murray	So you're not off until you get results? Well, keep up the hard work.																						
158	159		201							1	500166	5																						
159	160		301							1	Lucia	...Results? Are they not on a surveillance mission? Are they looking for something?	1																					
160	161		202							1					1																			
161	162		301								Murray	Alright, I'll stop prodding you about your mission. Wanna get some afternoon tea? Your favorite cafe is back open.																						
162	163		201							1	500166	5																						
163	164		301							1	Lucia	...Favorite cafe? That must mean he's speaking to a human.	1																					
164	165		202							1					1																			
165	166		301								Murray	Oh, right. Is Kugawa off today? Wanna invite him?

169	167		301							1		A stern look washes over the faces of the trio standing in the preparation room.																						
170	168		301									A Kurono henchman following orders is pacing outside the Gray Raven preparation room, searching for some sort of results.																						
171	169		301									The trio speculated that the current situation may have been due to violating military orders during the last mission, suspicion over a private link with Luna, or even because of serious symptoms from Mind Beacon corruption.																						
172	170		301									But based on the current information, this appears to be the worst-case scenario.																						
173	171		301									Seems like a plot that had been in the works for quite some time is finally coming to fruition.																						
174	2005		202							1	2	3			1																			
175	172		301									Just like that, Murray was able to convey this fragmented information to the trio inconspicuously through just the right volume and chit-chat. And with that, Murray laughs with the guard as they both walk away.																						
176	173		301									Once no more movement can be detected from outside the door, Liv takes her hand off the desktop. Receiving the signal, the other two begin to relax a little.																						
177	174		301									Up until this point, Lucia never thought she would need to use such a tactic in the Gray Raven's preparation room. She shakes her head gently and looks back at the screen.																						
178	175		201							1	500166	5																						
179	176		301							1	Lucia	...	1																					
180	177		202							1					1																			
181	178		301									She presses her hand on the side of the screen, opening up a hidden data file on the terminal.																						
182	179		301									These were the records and data she quickly searched when she began to feel a disturbance in her memory. However, at the time, she could only access the external data due to the file encryption.																						
183	180		301									After recovering her memory and returning to Babylonia, Lucia asked Lee in confidence to copy the data onto her terminal and decrypt it.																						
184	181		301									Under heavy surveillance, Lee had hastily decrypted a portion of the file.																						
185	182		301									Once decrypted, Lucia had obtained a casualty report. However, aside from the list of casualties for that week being several times longer than normal, including Murol and Xun, nothing appeared out the ordinary.																						
186	183		301									Lucia searches the newly recovered memories in her M.I.N.D.																						
187	184		301									She cross-checks the names of soldiers and comrades in her memory with the names on the list.																						
188	185		301									All of the names that she can recall appear on the list, each marked with their chilling cause of death.																						
189	186		301									However, aside from those familiar names, she sees several names she does not recognize at the same time of death.																						
190	187		201							1	500166	5																						
191	188		301							1	Lucia	Those are...	1																					
192	189		301									The names include five commandants, their squads, and dozens of researchers.																						
193	190		301								Lucia	Not only Ravenge, but five other commandants and their squads as well? Wait, why are all the researchers marked with... a lab accident for the "Project Winter"... as their cause of death?	1																					
194	191		301									Lucia looks at the undisclosed "Project Winter", then meticulously reads through data on each of the researchers.																						
195	192		301									Most of the researchers were transferred from Kurono, but a select few are listed as confidential.																						
196	193		301									As Lucia continues to read through the file, she discovers that two of the researchers had died more recently than the others.																						
197	194		301								Lucia	This casualty report is still being updated? Why would they be recorded along with those that died a long time ago?	1																					
198	195		301									Lucia begins to connect the dots in her heart. She looks back at the "Project Winter".																						
199	196		301									What even is this project? She cannot figure out anything purely based on the name alone. Perhaps that is the point.																						
200	197		301									Thinking for some time to no avail, she looks back at the two researchers on the roster. She notices that they worked in the Science Council up until their death.																						
201	198		301								Lucia	Their names were... Ann and Rand.	1																					
202	199		301								Lucia	If they were members of the Science Council, maybe Asimov knows a thing or two...?	1																					
203	200		301									She wants to ask him about it, but then remembers the message they received, "Speak carefully, act cautiously."																						
204	201		301									Lucia looks up to see Lee reading the terminal as he assembles a tiny robot.																						
205	202		301									After decrypting the data, he resisted the urge to speak several times as if he had a sneaking suspicion about the identity of who sent the anonymous tip.																						
206	203		301								Lucia	Who sent the message?	1																					
207	204		301									Whoever it is, we need to tread lightly.

218	214		301								Celica	Can we do what we did last time and have people from the Star of Life provide treatment?	2																					
219	215		301								Hassen	Their people infiltrated their ranks ages ago. Without fixing the fundamental issue, they'll just take 【kuroname】 somewhere else to be "monitored."	1

224	220		301									It was supposed to be top priority, but all these disasters keep distracting our wunderkind.																						
225	221		301									If we involve the Science Council in non-technical matters at a time like this, I'm afraid it will only make matters worse.

228	224		301							1	Hassen	I hope he can solve these complicated technical issues to the point of being able to pass it off to his subordinates.	1																					
229	225		301								Hassen	How about the others?	1																					
230	226		301								Celica	...Same old same old.	2																					
231	227		301								Celica	They can't keep going like this, Mr. President.	2

234	230		301									Before he can respond, a young staff member walks in and salutes.

236	232		201							2	500303		450																					
237	233		301							1	Hassen	How is 【kuroname】 holding up?	1																					
238	234		301								Staff Member	Seems like everything is normal.	2																					
239	235		301								Hassen	What do you mean, "seems"?	1																					
240	236		301								Staff Member	According to the report given by experts, 【kuroname】 periodically falls into a state of comatose with increased subconscious activity.	2																					
241	237		301								Staff Member	During breakfast, 【kuroname】 just stares at the cup. Last night, the commandant was pacing around in the room... Sure didn't look normal at least.	2																					
242	238		301								Hassen	Even normal people would do this sort of thing if they have no way to keep themselves entertained or sleep.	1																					
243	239		301								Hassen	Anything else?	1																					
244	240		301								Staff Member	They submitted an application claiming that 【kuroname】 violated military orders due to the issues they are currently looking into. If it continues on like this, Constructs linked with the commandant may also begin to exhibit abnormalities, so...	2																					
245	241		301									He takes out a small chip and hands it to the exhausted Hassen.																						
246	242		301								Hassen	So they need to monitor the commandant for a few more days?	1																					
247	243		301								Staff Member	Correct.	2																					
248	244		202							1	2				1																			
249	245		401							2	1516																							
250	246		301									Hassen takes the chip and nods. He watches as the staff turns and leaves.																						
251	247		201							1	500011		-450																					
252	248		201							2	500001	5	450																					
253	249		301							1	Celica	Mr. President...	2																					
254	250		301								Hassen	I was worried this was going to happen...	1																					
255	251		301								Celica	You mean the effects of Mind Beacon corruption on 【kuroname】?	2																					
256	252		301								Hassen	No, the commandant's symptoms are minor. They didn't worsen during ground operations either, which is a far cry from when commandants were corrupted in the past.	1																					
257	253		301								Hassen	We can now determine that 【kuroname】 has built up a resistance to mind corruption. That's precisely why people are more worried.	1																					
258	254		301								Hassen	We haven't found out who leaked the commandant's mission report, but now they know that Huaxu detected the commandant's potential ability to link with Ascendants.	1																					
259	255		301								Celica	I wasn't expecting Huaxu to find a backdoor the first time I let Gray Raven use the Spear of F.O.S... This is worse than I thought.	2																					
260	256		301									Hassen holds the chip in his hand, lost in thought as he looks out into the vast cosmos.																						
261	257		301								Hassen	All this monitoring is just false pretense. The commandant's resistance to mind corruption is just their window of opportunity.	1																					
262	258		301								Hassen	How long can those "sharks" wait in the depths when they smell blood in the water?	1																					
263	259		301								Hassen	How many more people must be sacrificed this time?	1																					
264	260		301									Silence hangs over the bridge.																						
265	261		301									Celica opens her mouth in preparation to speak, but she finds herself unable to muster a response. Even after processing the reports for everything that had happened, she only had a rough idea of what was unfolding.																						
266	262		301								Hassen	Nikola once told me that squads with a close-knit bond would end up like Suzaku.	1																					
267	263		301								Hassen	He didn't outright say it, but I could tell by the look in his eyes that he was worried this squad would go rogue.	1																					
268	264		301								Hassen	Whether it's because we cherish their talent or to prevent them from going rogue, we cannot hand over 【kuroname】.	1																					
269	265		301								Hassen	At least not until we ensure that 【kuroname】 is safe from whatever it is they're planning.	1																					
270	266		301								Celica	In that case...	2																					
271	267		301								Hassen	It's not that I'm unwilling to get involved.	1																					
272	268		301								Hassen	Regardless of personal reasons, they're still loyal to whoever is pulling the strings just as they are to their respective posts.	1																					
273	269		301								Hassen	Eliminating all of them would only make it more difficult moving forward.	1																					
274	270		301								Hassen	We need to come up with a more clever plan to get us out of this stalemate. We need people willing to fight for this cause without drawing their attention.	1																					
275	271		301								Hassen	We need to think of a way to give 【kuroname】 some time to rest.	1																					
276	272		301								Hassen	If this continues any longer, anyone would succumb to exhaustion and drop their guard—regardless of Mind Beacon corruption. This is a common tactic in interrogations.	1																					
277	273		301								Hassen	As soon as 【kuroname】 falls into their trap, the situation will no longer be under our control.	1																					
278	274		301								Celica	Looks like we'll need someone else for the upcoming mission.	2																					
279	275		301								Hassen	Indeed. These past few days have been quite the ordeal. Let 【kuroname】 return to the squad and rest up for a while.	1																					
280	276		204							2	4																							
281	277		301								Celica	Who are you going to give the recon mission to?	2																					
282	278		301								Hassen	Let the nearby Task Force scout the surrounding area. As for the core region... leave that to Strike Hawk.	1																					
283	279		301								Hassen	The scout team is ideal for conducting reconnaissance. Wanshi proved himself on the mission to deploy bit domain nodes, plus he's more familiar with that area.	1																					
284	280		301								Hassen	And... After seeing 【kuroname】 take full responsibility for "acting alone," he's been keeping a close eye on the commandant.	1																					
285	281		301								Hassen	Compassion is weakness. I understand this and so do they.	1																					
286	282		301								Hassen	Leaving Wanshi here only gives them another target. There's no point in getting Strike Hawk involved just yet.	1																					
287	283		301								Celica	【kuroname】 obtained valuable intel from the bit domain node, and Wanshi's actions complied with regulations. They shouldn't have shouldered the blame.	2																					
288	284		301								Hassen	Some people believe that Wanshi was following the commandant's orders. After all, they were together.	1																					
289	285		301								Hassen	Even if they can make amends, the law must still not be broken. If one person gets away from breaking the law, anyone blindly trusting their own ability will surely follow suit.	1																					
290	286		301								Celica	At least that's the official statement, correct?	2																					
291	287		301								Hassen	...Originally, there was a way for 【kuroname】 to avoid punishment.	1																					
292	288		301								Hassen	But now, some people want to impose additional charges to force 【kuroname】 under their control.	1																					
293	289		301								Hassen	I've done a lot behind the scenes but ensuring that 【kuroname】 only has to endure "confined treatment" has put me at my limits.	1																					
294	290		301									Hassan turns around and walks out along a path that has been worn into a luster over time by the crew.																						
295	291		301								Celica	We have a meeting coming up. Where are you going, sir?	2																					
296	292		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Hassen	Postpone it for half an hour. There are some things I need to confirm.	1

301	297		301									Half an hour before receiving the new mission, Chrome steps into the spacious confines of the closed laboratory five minutes early.																						
302	298		301									He pushes open the door to the dark room and greets Asimov, who is sitting among an array of holo-screens.																						
303	299		301								Asimov	Right on time.																						
304	300		301									Head down, Asimov gives Chrome a simple acknowledgement. The capsule beside him contains a new frame currently in stasis.

308	304		301								Asimov	I debugged your new frame according to the data obtained from the last combat simulation. I've re-established the virtual link for you to give it another try.	1																					
309	305		301								Chrome	Understood.	2																					
310	306		301									As if already familiar with the procedure, Chrome plugs the cable into the back of his neck.
