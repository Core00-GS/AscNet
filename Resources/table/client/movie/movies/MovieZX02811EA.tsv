20	20		301									The built-in gravity control system exerts enormous pressure on Karenina's body, her feet almost drilling into the ground to neutralize the impact. All the Corrupted around her are slammed onto the floor, their limbs twisting in strange directions.

33	33		301									But traces of ominous red can be seen among the ghostly blue hue.																						
34	34		301								Karenina	The Punishing Virus...! I knew it. The reactor core has the highest concentration.	1

45	45		301									There is no bacteria or insect on the Moon. The decay of the body can only be attributed to the Punishing Virus.																						
46	46		301									A large pile of paper full of formulae and data drops from the body's arms. Karenina carefully picks up a page, not expecting to see a familiar signature on it—Dr. Kalon.

63	63		301									Karenina suddenly notices that, even with how deformed these Corrupted look, they were all clearly Constructs.																						
64	64		301									While these Constructs models are not too different visually, there is one thing that distinguishes them from others—																						
65	65		301								Karenina	None of these Construct was manufactured recently. In fact, almost all of them are prototypes that never go through mass production...																						
66	66		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The zero-point reactor is like a time capsule that wraps the dead researchers and outdated prototypes in the past, along with the name of a genius. But as the reactor is activated again, time begins to flow, unveiling the secret within.

73	73		301									Dr. Kalon's rubbing between his eyebrows. He hasn't had a proper rest for a long time.																						
74	74		302								18.7%... That's already 1.4% higher than the last run.	75																						
75	75		301								Kalon	Don't try to make me feel better. Not even 20%... That means barely one out of five can survive the operation...	1																					
76	76		302								That's... the "necessary sacrifice."	77																						
77	77		301									Dr. Kalon bit his lips hard. We could hardly imagine the pain he was suffering from those numbers.																						
78	78		301									The failed cases could mostly be attributed to the part called "Inver-Device", which was supposed to help Constructs withstand a certain level of the Punishing Virus without turning into Corrupted.																						
79	79		301									Dr. Kalon seemed to have made up his mind. Trembling, he got up on his feet and walked to the center of the lab.																						
80	80		302								Doctor...	81																						
81	81		301								Kalon	Everybody, stop doing what you're doing. I have something very important to announce.	1																					
82	82		301								Kalon	Until now, we still don't understand how the Inver-Device works, let alone get it ready for production... This will only get more people killed on the operating table and the battlefield. The science we're so proud of is killing people now.	1																					
83	83		301								Kalon	Still, I firmly believe in the necessity of Constructs in the war against the Punishing Virus. We have to get it done no matter what.	1																					
84	84		301									Dr. Kalon sounded like a lecturer announcing the homework to his students. His voice wasn't loud, but everyone in the room was listening carefully.																						
85	85		301								Kalon	Our understanding of the Inver-Device is limited to the very few words left by that genius mind... The virus has infected numerous research facilities. Most information was lost in the pandemic.	1																					
86	86		301								Kalon	We were hoping that we could also learn the theory and structure of the Inver-Device from scratch, but reality proved us wrong. The most we could do was to replicate its structure; the technology within is still a black box to us.	1																					
87	87		301									Dr. Kalon circled the receptor-shaped Inver-Device on his whiteboard, then drew another arrow pointing to a name—"Punishing Virus".																						
88	88		301								Kalon	Most importantly, this device would only work after we inject it with a certain dosage of Punishing Virus... Our hypothesis is the virus acts like some sort of antigen, but we have no clue how it works or how much dosage we should use.	1																					
89	89		301									Many Inver-Devices caused serious Punishing Virus infection after they were installed, turning their hosts into Corrupted, forcing us to terminate them.																						
90	90		301								Kalon	We could easily get the virus on the ground, but it is extremely risky and there are no facilities to use down there. Up here in Babylonia, there is no way we would be allowed to conduct any Punishing Virus-related experiment, so no access to the virus here either...	1																					
91	91		302								Are you implying there's nothing we can do...?	92																						
92	92		301									Dr. Kalon shook his head. He drew an upward dotted line on the whiteboard, which linked to a small circle above.																						
93	93		301								Kalon	There's one last place we can use... The zero-point energy base on the Moon.	1																					
94	94		301									Many of my colleagues immediately began to question his decision... Looking back now, it was indeed an extremely difficult choice.																						
95	95		302								But there is no Punishing Virus on the Moon, Doctor?	96																						
96	96		301								Kalon	I know... But we can make it.	1																					
97	97		301									His words shocked almost everybody. Was he trying to activate the zero-point reactor and recreate that tragedy?!																						
98	98		301								Kalon	Of course... We will use extreme caution and closely monitor the usage rate of the reactor core. If all goes well, we should be able to produce an infinitesimal amount of viruses to study.	1																					
99	99		301									But this theory was obviously too risky. Even the Doctor himself had never tried it.																						
100	100		302								There's no way that Babylonia would agree...	101																						
101	101		301								Kalon	Right. That's why this time we're working with an external organization unaffiliated with the Babylonia Parliament. Only they can support our research...	1																					
102	102		301								Kalon	We'll be in close contact with the Punishing Virus, so there will be no machine to aid us. We can only rely on paper, pen, and brain.	1																					
103	103		301								Kalon	We are mere mortals... But if there isn't a smart way to do it, we will use the stupidest one, calculating and testing again and again through trial and error until we find the answer!	1																					
104	104		301								Kalon	In this experiment, we need to run an infinite number of calculations, but we can't afford to make even the tiniest mistake... Any mistake will get us killed.	1																					
105	105		301								Kalon	And even if we have prepared vigorously, there is still too much we don't know about the Punishing Virus. In other words, our lives could end at any time...	1																					
106	106		301								Kalon	There's nothing more valuable than your life... I want you to take your time to consider.	1																					
107	107		301									As Dr. Kalon finished his speech, he wrote his name inside the circle that represented the Moon. He then stepped back, awaiting us to make our decisions.

110	110		301							1		Moments later, another researcher that often held different opinions from Dr. Kalon walked up the stage. Instead of writing down his name, he picked up the eraser and wiped off the circle outside Dr. Kalon's name.																						
111	111		302								Hey! What are you doing?!	112																						
112	112		301								Researcher	The old man's circle is way too small. There's no way it can fit that many names, am I right?	2																					
113	113		301									He picked up a pen and drew another enormous circle around the name—so large that it seemed like it could fit the entire world.																						
114	114		301									The lab burst into laughter when he wrote down his name. More researchers took the pen from him and left their names inside the circle.

119	119		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Still, he felt guilty... because most of us might not ever leave the distant Moon again.
