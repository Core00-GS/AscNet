157	165		301								Travelling Wizard	As you saw earlier, the villagers came to me for the same reason.	1																					
158	166		301								Travelling Wizard	Before the Ancient Triangle appeared, monsters often attacked the villages until heroes brought back the replicas of the Ancient Triangle from the Real of Dragons. But all the replicas have gone missing now...	1																					
159	167		302								Would you like us to go to the Realm of Dragons to retrieve new replicas?	168																						
160	168		301								Travelling Wizard	Only to put them on the graves of this village? What a brilliant idea.	1																					
161	169		301								Travelling Wizard	I mean, there's no way you can make it in time. You may as well... just collect the materials required to make them.	1																					
162	170		301								Travelling Wizard	I can make them a new replica as long as I have enough materials.	1

167	175		301								Lucia	So there is still a possible chance to fail, isn't it?	2																					
168	176		301								Travelling Wizard	Ahem, nobody is perfect.	1																					
169	177		301								Lucia	Recommended to prepare three times... No, four times the materials required... Just in case. Okay, what's next?	2																					
170	178		301									Lucia's serious attitude makes the Travelling Wizard give up the drama and finish his speech as soon as possible.																						
171	179		301								Travelling Wizard	The replica consists of three parts. The first is "Twin Souls", which can only be brought out from the Realm of Dragons, but worry not—I have already borrowed one from the nearby town. The next is "Flawless Rope". I got some from the black market, but there is only one left.	1																					
172	180		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Travelling Wizard	As for "Soulless Body", I have nothing left. Fortunately, we can find the material to make it nearby... Ordinary people won't be able to get close, but you are heroes...	1
