9	9		301									Watanabe gives a nod and looks at the Akdilek entourage. Smiling, Jamilah waves back at him.																						
10	10		301									Sophia stays at her side. She didn't seem to have moved at all. With not a single Corrupted form next to her, the Forsaken seem to have won the bout.																						
11	11		201							1	1101001																							
12	12		301							1	Watanabe	What is the meaning of this, Akdilek?	1																					
13	13		201							1	500127																							
14	14		301							1	Sophia	It's nothing. The boss merely told us not to engage.	1																					
15	15		201							1	500145

21	21		301							1	Forsaken Soldier	Wait, three containers? We had a deal for just one.	1																					
22	22		301								Jamilah	Miss Pulao specifically said "all of the cargo", did she not? You all heard it. Or do the Forsaken habitually forsake their agreements?	2																					
23	23		301								Forsaken Soldier	This ain't good, Watanabe-San. We still taking the cargo? We can't transport so much!	1																					
24	24		202							1	2																							
25	25		301									Watanabe closes his eyes with a sigh. Jamilah and her band of jackals noticed this in advance. That's why they let the cargo go uncontested.																						
26	26		201							1	500125	2																						
27	27		301							1	Jamilah	Sophia, it seems our Forsaken friends have run into a logistical pickle. Seeing as we are all comrades abandoned on this Earth, shouldn't the Akdeliks lend them a hand?	1																					
28	28		201							1	500127																							
29	29		301							1	Sophia	The Akdilek Commercial Alliance has fleets of medium to heavy transport vehicles, capable of safely handling long-haul logistics across any terrain, at a reasonable price.	1																					
30	30		201							1	1101001																							
31	31		301							1	Watanabe	Hmph, this was all part of your plan, wasn't it... Forget it. Let this be a lesson for us.	1																					
32	32		201							1	500172																							
33	33		301							1	Forsaken Soldier	Huh? What's that mean, Watanabe-San?	1																					
34	34		201							1	1101001																							
35	35		301							1	Watanabe	Sigh... we wish to engage the Akdileks' transportation service. When can you depart?	1																					
36	36		201							1	500125	1																						
37	37		301							1	Jamilah	Thank you for your patronage. We are ready to depart whenever you're ready... Changyu, you will lead the convoy and escort the cargo.	1

39	39		301									The silent, gawking black-haired adolescent jumps at the mention of his name, bewildered.

41	41		301							1	Changyu	Me? Wait, why me?	1																					
42	42		201							1	500125	1																						
43	43		301							1	Jamilah	Sophia and I have trading partners to seek out here, and you'll be of no use in that.	1																					
44	44		201							1	1101001																							
45	45		301							1	Watanabe	Hey, is this kid really up to the task?	1																					
46	46		201							1	500125	1																						
47	47		301							1	Jamilah	Of course. He is a force to be reckoned with among the Akdileks. Best not to underestimate him.	1																					
48	48		201							1	500124																							
49	49		301							1	Changyu	Huh, just as well, I want off this boat anyway.	1																					
50	50		201							1	500125	1																						
51	51		301							1	Jamilah	So, Changyu, would you please escort the Forsaken to their cargo?	1																					
52	52		202							1																								
53	53		301									As Jamilah waves goodbye to Changyu's group, Sophia finally asks the question that's been on her mind.																						
54	54		201							1	500127																							
55	55		301							1	Sophia	Boss, why did you specifically ask Changyu to escort them?	1																					
56	56		202							1																								
57	57		301									Jamilah gazes at the departing Watanabe, accompanied by Changyu, and a smile creeps onto her face.

62	62		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Jamilah	...so, can I trust you with this?																						
63	63		302								Why the Gray Raven?	64																						
64	64		301								Jamilah	You should find it hard to refuse, what with us being good acquaintances and all.																						
65	65		302								...	66																						
66	66		301								Jamilah	I kid... but I feel that the members of your team, that kid included, could use a little trip to get used to your new changes.																						
67	67		301								Jamilah	I think that it is an excellent suggestion. Don't you?																						
68	68		302								...I'll consider it.	69																						
69	69		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Jamilah	Hoho, I think you'll thank me for it‚ÄîCommandant.
