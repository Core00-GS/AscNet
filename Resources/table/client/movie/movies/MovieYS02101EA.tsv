34	34		201							1	1011001	10																						
35	35		301							1	Lee	I closed the tactical terminal for now. Turns out the memory intends to attack us.	1																					
36	36		201							1	1031001																							
37	37		301							1	Liv	But she won't be able to touch us for real... right?	1

47	47		302								Perhaps I've got an idea.	48	Lee, reactivate the terminal.	48

57	57		301								Cottie	You won't get away with it if you're waking me up just for some boring little stuff!	1																					
58	58		301								Cottie	Well, what's this feeling...	1																					
59	59		301								Cottie	I see. Huh, it was the commandant's idea, right? You've found the right person this time.	1																					
60	60		301								Cottie	Aife, is that you?	1																					
61	61		201							1	500078

63	63		201							1	500079																							
64	64		301							1	Cottie	You're still the same as before, ready to attack others at any time, you cross sniper.	1																					
65	65		201							1	500078																							
66	66		301							1	Aife	Isn't it normal to be on alert and take a defensive stance with weapons at all times?	1																					
67	67		201							1	500079																							
68	68		301							1	Cottie	Are you calling sniping defense? Forget it, take a good look at the person behind.	1

78	78		301							1	Cottie	Hmph, after all, "that guy" has barely won my approval. I could never be wrong about others!	1																					
79	79		201							1	500078																							
80	80		301							1	Aife	Then I got it.	1																					
81	81		201							1	1011001																							
82	82		301							1	Lee	The timing is just right. Test for memory integrity and corruption completed. Ready for recycling.	1																					
83	83		201							1	500078																							
84	84		301							1	Aife	Sergeants are always at their disposal. Whatever the order is, consider it done.	1																					
85	85		302								Alright, Aife?	86	Start recycling, Lee.	86																				
86	86		301								Aife	Commandant... I haven't heard of it in a while.	1																					
87	87		201							1	1011001

94	94		301								Cottie	... like having a lot of delicious donuts!	1																					
95	95		301								Cottie	But! If you dare to wake me up from a sweet dream of donuts, you'd have to take responsibility for it!	1																					
96	96		301								Cottie	I don't care what enemies you're up against, or what damn Punishing Virus, I just want you to win! Got it?	1																					
97	97		302								Understood.	98	Leave it to us.	98
