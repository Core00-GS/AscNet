6	6		301								Luna	The way it should. The betrayer becomes betrayed, dying in the dream that is his childhood.	2																					
7	7		301								Luna	Shome's end will be a good wake-up call to his like.	2																					
8	8		301								α	Looks like everything's going our way.	1

10	9		301								α	So why don't you look happy?	1																					
11	10		301								Luna	Huh?	2																					
12	11		301									Luna blanks out shortly from Alpha's words. As if realizing the unusual expression she is wearing, she quickly adjusts and returns to normal.																						
13	12		204							2																								
14	13		301								Luna	It's nothing.	2																					
15	14		301								α	It's okay. Tell me when you feel like it.	1

22	20		301									At Alpha's question, Luna lowers her head in thought. Alpha stands by her in wait, glancing at the surrounding scenery. The sea breeze blows in the scent of summer, rustling the coconut trees on the beach.

28	27		301									Lamia suddenly emerges from the sea and claps her hands excitedly. She claps a scant few times before freezing when she realizes Alpha's blade is on her neck.																						
29	28		301								Lamia	Eep—	2																					
30	29		301								α	Wasn't asking you.	1																					
31	30		301								α	And I've warned you. Don't go invisible around me. Read the room before you pop out.	1																					
32	31		301								Lamia	Sorry! I'll be careful next time!	2																					
33	32		301								α	I've heard that more than enough. Looks like you need a few broken legs to remember.	1

36	35		301									Lamia struggles, desperately, even stealing glances at Luna in plea for help. Seeing the two, a light chirp escapes Luna's lips.

39	38		301									Alpha and Lamia pause at Luna's laugh. Luna shakes her head and speaks.																						
40	39		301								Luna	If you say so, Sis. Then let's take a rest.	1																					
41	40		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Luna	...We'll rest all that we can before the Babylonia reinforcements arrive.	1

45	43		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The summer heat did not falter even at night. The night breeze, brought over by the sea, is a wave of turgid humidity. Unpleasant though it may be, it does nothing to damper the enthusiasm of those at the beach.																						
46	44		301									The crowd from Babylonia are holding a grand celebration on the beach. In contrast, the walkway is cold and empty.

48	46		301									Footfalls pitter and patter from one end of the walkway, infusing this desolate street with a hint of liveliness.

60	58		301								Lamia	Lamia's stats are normal!	2																					
61	59		301								Lamia	...Why can't we be like the people in the poster over there, relaxing on the beach in our swimsuits with snacks in our hands?	2																					
62	60		301								Lamia	Doing nothing... Thinking about nothing... No despair, no nothing...	2																					
63	61		301								Lamia	...	2																					
64	62		301								α	Why are you staring at us?	1																					
65	63		301									Lamia goes from gabbling to silence, staring at Luna and Alpha.																						
66	64		301								Lamia	I'm imagining you both on the beach in swimsuits. The thought itself scares me, so forget it.	2																					
67	65		301								α	...	1																					
68	66		301								Lamia	Aaaaa... Come to think of it, even swimsuits are meaningless for us... I guess... swimsuits are only destined for cute little humans...	2																					
69	67		301								α	Should we set off some fireworks?	1																					
70	68		301								Lamia	I mean... there's no point. But yes.	2

72	70		301									Alpha interrupts the Lamia radiating with negativity by thrusting her a bundle of fireworks she found somewhere. Lamia receives the fireworks, raising them like a flag as she slithers toward the beach.

76	74		301								Luna	Did you see something you want?	2																					
77	75		301								α	Yeah.	1																					
78	76		401							2	1516																							
79	77		301									Alpha nods, and brings Luna to one of the stores along the pedestrian walkway.																						
80	78		301									The inside of the shop is a practical Shark-speare paradise. Shark-speare plushies, Shark-speare ads, and more. A big sign, hanging in front of the store counter, reads: Opening sale, 70% off.																						
81	79		301								Luna	Looks like a place that sells shark souvenirs.	2																					
82	80		301								α	Not just sharks. Look at this.	1																					
83	81		301									As Alpha speaks, she filches out a mini frog plushie from behind a pile of Shark-speare plushies and hands it to Luna.																						
84	82		204							2	13																							
85	83		301								Luna	Why is this everywhere?	2																					
86	84		301								α	Not a bad thing, though?	1

103	100		301								α	Besides, there's no what-ifs in this world.	2																					
104	101		301									Alpha replies to Luna's sudden question without much thought, but it draws out a long silence from Luna. Alpha stops in her tracks when she realizes Luna is behind, staring at her with a stern expression.																						
105	102		301								Luna	What if there are?	1																					
106	103		301								α	...You mean Shome's research?	2																					
107	104		301								Luna	...Yeah.	1																					
108	105		301								Luna	Shome only saw one side of his research, but there is another side that no one's noticed.	1																					
109	106		301								Luna	At the end on that other side lies the true "origin."	1																					
110	107		301								α	...	2																					
111	108		301									A gust of sea breeze washes over. The stifling heat seems to be finally dying down. The night is now carrying a hint of chilling cold instead. Luna raises her head to look at the Alpha beside her and speaks.

113	110		301								Luna	I'm a little tired, Sis.	1

116	113		301									Holding Luna's hand, Alpha sits down on a bench next to the pedestrian walkway with Luna. Luna leans her head on Alpha's shoulder and closes her eyes.
