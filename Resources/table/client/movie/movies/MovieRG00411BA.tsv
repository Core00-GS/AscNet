5	5		301								Staessen	There are not just refugees from the Green-Vanostok Line, but also from Central Asia and Western Europe.	1																					
6	6		301								Staessen	I must be clear. The ARU can only feed so many mouths.	1

10	10		301							1	Staessen	When Babylonia recovered Kyaranta, we sent some of the refugees over there, so they could feed themselves.	1																					
11	11		301								Staessen	But as the numbers grew, so too did the different opinions.	1																					
12	12		301								Staessen	In the end, the refugees of the Green-Varnostok Line were driven out by other refugees. So, they established a Border Commune somewhere near Kyaranta.	1																					
13	13		301								Staessen	Even though they are located near Kyaranta, they've been unable to receive sufficient supplies.	1																					
14	14		302								Why is that?	15																						
15	15		301								Staessen	We were too busy back then. We didn't have time to settle their issues.	1																					
16	16		301								Staessen	I was worried that further intervention will force the ARU to supply more resources. Which is why we've always maintained a conservative approach on the matter.	1																					
17	17		301								Staessen	As long as there are no bloody conflicts, the ARU will not intervene in the management of refugee settlements.	1																					
18	18		301								Liv	But...	2																					
19	19		301								Staessen	We don't want to suppress people, but at the same time, we cannot sacrifice the ARU's vital resources.	1																					
20	20		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Staessen	Which is why we've just been ignoring them... There was no other way.	1
