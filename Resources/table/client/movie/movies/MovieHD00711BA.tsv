7	7		301									All of you surround the small hill of red envelopes piled in the middle of the abandoned mall in silence.																						
8	8		301									Nanami, meanwhile, threads through the piles dextrously, hard at work.																						
9	9		301								Karenina	One of you... say something! Didn't you say we'll find them if we collect all these red envelopes?! Those... Xi, where are they?	1																					
10	10		301								Bianca	Commandant, I know I said they're safe to eat, but still... I don't recommend ingesting so much sugar.	2

13	13		301								Karenina	You idiot, don't just stand there and eat!	1																					
14	14		301									Karenina puts down her rocket launcher with a heavy "thump," and she puts a hand on her hip, stamping her foot, annoyed.

17	17		301							1	Nanami	Ha!	1																					
18	18		301								Nanami	Alright, Nanami's decoration is complete! Hehe, how's my rice cake, Commandant?	1																					
19	19		302								Very delicious.	20	(Keep chewing)	20

23	23		301								Karenina	You, and you, and you! Get up and do something or I'm going to find that Xi thing myself!	2																					
24	24		302								Humans need sustenance.	25																						
25	25		204							2																								
26	26		301								Karenina	Tch. Sure you do!	2																					
27	27		204							1	5																							
28	28		301								Nanami	Karenina still doesn't trust Nanami!	1																					
29	29		301								Nanami	Nanami was working so hard! Can't you tell?	1																					
30	30		204							1																								
31	31		301									Nanami pulls Karenina's arm and drags her to a higher vantage point in the ruins.																						
32	32		204							2	5																							
33	33		301								Karenina	What the hell—what is this? Stop dragging me!	2																					
34	34		204							2																								
35	35		301								Karenina	What... is this...	2																					
36	36		301									Looking down, you find the emptied ruin is now adorned with a giant smiley face, assembled with the red envelopes you collected earlier. In the middle of it is a table laid with all kinds of snacks and candies.																						
37	37		302								That looks pretty nice.	38	Why do you have to decorate it like that?	48																				
38	38		204							1	1																							
39	39		301								Nanami	I know Commandant will understand Nanami's hard work!	1																					
40	40		302								But what are those on the table?	41																						
41	41		301								Nanami	Not bad, am I right? They're New Year's Goods for the Lunar New Year, and they're also really good baits! But we don't have much to work with... so this is only enough for one big hunt.	1																					
42	42		301								Nanami	Commandant, if you want another piece... Nanami will let you have one more as a reward for your work! The last one!	1																					
43	43		302								That'll be great!	44																						
44	44		301									And you face the wrath of Karenina.																						
45	45		204							2	5																							
46	46		301								Karenina	Stop eating! Can someone explain to me what's going on?!	2																					
47	47		302								Fine, fine...	54																						
48	48		204							1	1																							
49	49		301								Nanami	To complete our mission—to lure Xi out!	1																					
50	50		302								With all the colorful stuff?	51	And what's on the table?	52																				
51	51	53	301								Nanami	They're not just pretty colors! The food on the table is the bait Nanami's specially prepared!	1																					
52	52		301								Nanami	The food on the table is the bait Nanami's specially prepared!	1																					
53	53		301								Nanami	But there isn't much to begin with! During Lunar New Year they'd have all these New Year's Goods! Nanami spent a lot of effort collecting them!	1																					
54	54		301								Karenina	Are you kidding me... Those things don't even have a mouth! How would they be attracted by food?	2																					
55	55		203							1	0.25	600																						
56	56		203							2	0.25	-600																						
57	57		201							3	1091001																							
58	58		301							1	Bianca	But Xi's behavior has been extremely abnormal. Maybe Nanami was right about their... non-mechanical logic.	3																					
59	59		301								Karenina	But how...	2																					
60	60		204							1	14																							
61	61		301								Nanami	Nanami wasn't lying... Please believe me! Sob...	1																					
62	62		301									Karenina's expression softens upon seeing Nanami crying.																						
63	63		204							2																								
64	64		301								Karenina	Dammit... Alright, alright. I'll go with what you said, alright?	2																					
65	65		204							1	1																							
66	66		301								Nanami	Hehe! I know Karey deary is on my side all along!	1																					
67	67		301								Karenina	Hey, weren't you just crying?	2																					
68	68		302								She was obviously pretending...	69	Karenina is quite gullible...	69																				
69	69		301								Karenina	****! Shut up!	2																					
70	70		301								Nanami	Now, our final step! We need to decorate this mall with even more colors! More nice smells! More pretty things!	1																					
71	71		301								Bianca	But where would we even find something like that...	3																					
72	72		301								Nanami	With your imagination, duh! Make and craft some things you like!	1																					
73	73		202							1	2	3			1																			
74	74		301									And so all of you sit down inside the mall, a group of novice crafters once again crafting things.																						
75	75		302								It's like deja vu...																							
76	76		201							1	1111001																							
77	77		301							1	Karenina	****! I can't believe you're asking me to do an arts and crafts project!	1																					
78	78		302								You're doing great, though.	79	Your works are impressive.	79																				
79	79		301								Karenina	O-of course! That's redundant... I'm good at everything I do!	1																					
80	80		202							1					1																			
81	81		301									Bianca also has a stack of carefully folded decorations completed in front of her.																						
82	82		302								They look beautiful.	83	Bianca, you're so much faster at this than I am.	85																				
83	83		201							1	1091001																							
84	84	87	301							1	Bianca	There were a lot of children in the church back in the days, so I used to do this a lot. A nice trick to keep the children happy...	1																					
85	85		201							1	1091001																							
86	86		301								Bianca	Commandant, you're also quite a fast learner. Your work isn't too shabby yourself.	1

91	91		301								Karenina	I don't care what you say! I'm not...	1																					
92	92		301								Nanami	We just need one final thing from Karey deary here!	2																					
93	93		301								Karenina	Hmph. I guess you really can't do this without me in the end, can you? What is it?	1																					
94	94		301								Nanami	Well, that—	2																					
95	95		302								What?	96																						
96	96		301								Karenina	You mean...	1																					
97	97		301								Nanami	Yep! That one! Do it again!	2																					
98	98		301									Karenina points her rocket launcher to the air, asking again uncertainly.																						
99	99		302								You can't mean...	100	No way...	100																				
100	100		301								Karenina	You're talking about this?	1																					
101	101		301								Nanami	That's right! Waiting for you!	2																					
102	102		302								Hold on—	103																						
103	103		401							2	10007502																							
104	104		301			RImgBg1Shake						You are stopped by a loud explosion. Karenina has launched her rocket, and the ground immediately shakes as a response.																						
105	105		204							1	5																							
106	106		301								Karenina	Is that enough?	1																					
107	107		301									Karenina shouts amidst the explosion.																						
108	108		301								Nanami	One more! One more!	2																					
109	109		301									With confidence, Nanami peeks at how the Xi are reacting. Unlike how they ran from the loud noises earlier, they have yet to run away from the explosion, seemingly confirming her theory.																						
110	110		401							2	10007502																							
111	111		301			RImgBg1Shake						Another explosion echos in the space and small bits of dust and ceilings fall from above.																						
112	112		301									Not only have the sparks from the explosion caught your Construct companions' attention, but they have also enthralled Xi. Maybe they are staying due to their fascination with beautiful things.																						
113	113		401							2	10007502																							
114	114		301			RImgBg1Shake					Karenina	Haha! How about this?	1																					
115	115		301								Nanami	Perfect! Another one! And... with these!	2																					
116	116		301									Nanami brings over a bunch of colorful ribbons and confetti, as well as a huge amount of glitter—items she has scavenged from the mall, no doubt.																						
117	117		301								Nanami	Karenina, set your launcher to the minimum heat setting and the force output to the highest!	2																					
118	118		301								Karenina	No problem! I get it! Let's give them a loud one!	2

121	121		301							1	Bianca	...	1																					
122	122		302								...	123																						
123	123		301								Bianca	I can't say for certain that this would work...	1																					
124	124		301									Bianca crosses her arms, while Nanami and Karenina are having the time of their lives with their explosives.																						
125	125		301								Bianca	...But let's treat this as our break before our job begins.	1																					
126	126		302								Yeah, you're right.	127																						
127	127		202							1					1																			
128	128		301									After a series of bombastic actions, Nanami suddenly puts up her hand, and the explosion ceases afterward.																						
129	129		201							1	1111001		-400																					
130	130		201							2	500091		400																					
131	131		301							1	Karenina	What's up? Did we do it...	1																					
132	132		301								Nanami	Shh—	2																					
133	133		301								Nanami	Quiet! I can feel them... approaching...	2																					
134	134		302								Them?	135

139	139		201							3	500005		-600																					
140	140		301							1		Right at that moment, a group of people shows up at the entrance of the mall. The figure leading the group is holding a gun in his hand, and on his body is a familiar jacket.																						
141	141		302								Watanabe...?!	142																						
142	142		301									Watanabe gives the area a scan until his eyes meet yours, and you see him noticeably breathe a sigh of relief, and his body relaxes.																						
143	143		301									But then he immediately does a sign for "quiet," and with a wave of his hand, a fully geared troop appears behind him, scouting.																						
144	144		302								(What is this...?)	145																						
145	145		301								Watanabe	You... are Constructs from Babylonia, aren't you? So you've been accompanying the commandant...	1

149	149		301							1	Karenina	The Forsaken?! Why are you here—are you following us?!	2																					
150	150		301								Bianca	Commandant, please take cover. You've seen what this man had done.	1																					
151	151		202							1	2				1																			
152	152		201							1	1101001																							
153	153		301							1	Watanabe	Ha, are we shooting first and asking later? In that case, we aren't going to stand here just to be your target practice.	1																					
154	154		302								All of you, calm down!	156																						
155	155		202							1					1																			
156	156		301									Seeing how everyone is on the verge of drawing their weapons, you have a sense that Karenina is just a step away from striking. At this moment, however, a few children dash forward from behind Watanabe.																						
157	157		201							1	500279																							
158	158		201							2	500279		600

160	160		301							1	Ann	There's the supplier!	3																					
161	161		301								Deckard	For real?!	3																					
162	162		301								Xiuyong	I was so scared when we were lost and ran into the Corrupted earlier...	3																					
163	163		202							1	2	3			1																			
164	164		201							1	1091001																							
165	165		301							1	Bianca	These are the Forsaken's children... What were you thinking about bringing them to somewhere so dangerous?!	1																					
166	166		301									Seeing the children, Bianca lays down her arms, her voice going from alerted to motherly.																						
167	167		202							1					1																			
168	168		301									Knowing that Bianca has no intention of attacking anymore, Watanabe also orders his men to put down their weapons.																						
169	169		201							1	1101001																							
170	170		301							1	Watanabe	We were just bringing them to look for 【kuroname】. We weren't expecting to find Corrupted here.	1																					
171	171		201							1	1111001																							
172	172		301							1	Karenina	Wait a minute—did you say Corrupted? But we haven't run into any Corrupted so far... Ahh!	1																					
173	173		203			PanelActor1Shake			500	1	0.1	-400																						
174	174		301									Before Karenina can finish, a dark shadow darts out from a corner and hits her on its way.																						
175	175		204							1	5																							
176	176		301								Karenina	What the—what is that? A Corrupted?!	1																					
177	177		301									Karenina quickly turns and points her rocket launcher toward the dark shadow. Right when she is about to pull the trigger—																						
178	178		201							2	500091	5	400																					
179	179		301							1	Nanami	Wait! Don't attack Xi!	2																					
180	180		204							1																								
181	181		301									Karenina stops her attack abruptly upon hearing that, and she pauses and finds the mechanoid in front of her coated in colorful paint.																						
182	182		204							2																								
183	183		301								Karenina	This is Xi? Doesn't matter... It was trying to attack me...	1																					
184	184		301								Nanami	It's not like that! Let Nanami do the talking, please!	2																					
185	185		301								Karenina	Are you kidding? You want to talk to that thing—	1																					
186	186		202							1	2				1																			
187	187		301									Suddenly, you hear a series of clanking sounds from the empty hall as the two argue, and a large group of "Xi" rushes in from nowhere toward Karenina and the Forsaken.																						
188	188		201							1	1101001																							
189	189		301							1	Watanabe	Stay behind me, you three!	1																					
190	190		202							1					1																			
191	191		301									The three children scream as they run and hide behind Watanabe, but Xi do not appear to want to attack them. Instead, they rush toward a corner, seemingly frightened.																						
192	192		201							1	500091																							
193	193		301							1	Nanami	What's wrong with you guys... You look like something's going after you.	1

195	195		301							1	Bianca	Corrupted! The Corrupted are after them!	1

197	197		201							2	500279		400																					
198	198		301							1	Xiuyong	Ah! That's the thing we ran into!	2																					
199	199		301									Before the Corrupted is a Xi, albeit much bigger. It appears as startled as the other Xi, but it is fighting against the Corrupted despite its nerves to protect its companions.																						
200	200		301								Watanabe	Fighting for its companions instead of abandoning them, that's the indication of a good leader... Hey, Babylonians, are we not helping the Xi?	1																					
201	201		202							1	2				1																			
202	202		201							1	1111001	5																						
203	203		301							1	Karenina	Of course we are! Regardless of the reasons, it is our job to destroy the Corrupted!	1																					
204	204		201							1	500091																							
205	205		301							1	Nanami	For our lovely Xi! Go, my brave bodyguards! Hurry!	1
