4	4		301									The peaceful facade of Babylonia would have tricked her into believing that everything has gone back to normal... if not for the obstacles and pain she has experienced throughout the adaptation.																						
5	5		301									The Constructs that returned with Liv either have been sent to Star of Life, are currently being treated, or have their names recorded on the casualty list.																						
6	6		301									Those who once gathered at conservation areas 043 and 046 have mostly survived, but the conditions of a few of them are still critical.

9	9		301									Apart from following the protocol to work on her adaptation, Liv has mostly spent her time in Star of Life, assisting the doctors there and looking after the patients.																						
10	10		301									She seems to have brought her habit on the surface back with her. Besides taking care of the patients, Liv will also jot down their particulars in her journal.																						
11	11		301									She knows that terminals that contain nonessential information will be reset after her frame is destroyed, so she has chosen pen and paper instead.																						
12	12		301									—Cosette, brought to Babylonia from the surface, is also staying at Star of Life under observation. She seems to be doing fine right now.																						
13	13		301									Celica has told Liv that Cosette will be transferred to the Youth Center later to await adoption. Or she might stay there until she has grown up.

16	16		301									—It has been over two months since 【kuroname】 was injured at the Pulia Forest Park Ruins.																						
17	17		301									Since returning to Babylonia, the commandant has been receiving the best medical treatment possible.																						
18	18		301									But the days pass by... and 【kuroname】 shows no sign of waking up. Not even when the heavily wounded Simon has woken up from his coma and comes to visit with the medical personnel's help.																						
19	19		301									All the doctors in Star of Life know full well that if 【kuroname】 does not wake up soon, there might be no waking up at all.																						
20	20		301									Being in a coma for over three months will create irreversible complications in a human's body.																						
21	21		301									Even if a miracle happens after three months, the best option the Chief commandant has is to turn into a Construct.																						
22	22		301									But miracles do not just happen. Not to mention that should the commandant wake up, all that awaits are the "adjustable" plans the Parliament has planned, eagerly paving the road to the end of a hero's journey.																						
23	23		301									Whenever night falls, and most of the patients and nurses are asleep, Liv will still be busy working in the halls of Star of Life.																						
24	24		301									The only time she stops is when she receives the daily mission report from the surface, and she will take a brief rest, eased by the images of the figures in relative safety.																						
25	25		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She is... a sparrow, trapped in an hourglass. Knowing that she will soon be buried by the shifting sand, she still refuses to give up on searching for a way out.

28	28		301									She is already ready to return and continue to help after finishing today's adaptation at the Council.																						
29	29		301									As long as she can offer an extra pair of hands, she can give everyone else a little breathing room, and more patients can be treated.

58	58		204							1																								
59	59		301								Liv	My apologies, Professor... I was just surprised to see you. I heard that you left Star of Life to focus on academic research, and you're no longer teaching or practicing.	1																					
60	60		301								Hippocrates	You're not wrong. I applied for early retirement to concentrate on things and research that I actually care about.	2																					
61	61		301								Hippocrates	But in times like this, no one gets to stay on the sidelines, I suppose. So here I am.	2																					
62	62		301									She shrugs, smiling.																						
63	63		301								Hippocrates	Asimov has told me what happened to you on the surface.	2

68	68		201							2	500404	1	400																					
69	69		301							1	Hippocrates	I've also checked on the Gray Raven Commandant. Not an easy job to bring someone with a brain injury like that back in one piece.	2																					
70	70		301								Hippocrates	Don't be too hard on yourself. Choices were made, and the die was cast. I know what happened down there. You did your best.	2

72	72		301									Hearing the words the Professor used to say to comfort her students, Liv shows a hint of bitterness in her smile.																						
73	73		301								Hippocrates	Word is that you're making an extraordinary frame here?	2																					
74	74		301								Hippocrates	You got me curious. Tell me more.	2																					
75	75		201							1	500004	8	-400																					
76	76		301							1	Asimov	...It's classified.	1																					
77	77		204							2	2																							
78	78		301								Hippocrates	I've submitted my request and signed the NDA. Here, see for yourself.	2																					
79	79		301									She opens her terminal and shows Asimov the notice she just received.

82	82		401					100		2	625

84	84		204							1																								
85	85		301								Asimov	The notice just says you're allowed to join. I don't think you've agreed to do it yet.	1																					
86	86		204							2	1																							
87	87		301								Hippocrates	I should learn more about the project before coming to a decision, shouldn't I?	2																					
88	88		401							2	1515																							
89	89		301									Asimov does not bother to argue anymore. He tabs on the monitor before him and pulls up a folder for Hippocrates.																						
90	90		301								Hippocrates	I see... So this is it...	2																					
91	91		301								Hippocrates	...It's the frame that utilizes the data from an agent, isn't it?	2																					
92	92		301								Hippocrates	Kurono is in over their heads, trying to make an Ascendant of their own. It might be powerful on the battlefield, but the frame comes with a side effect, doesn't it? It "attracts" the Punishing Virus like an actual Ascendant.	2																					
93	93		301								Hippocrates	Since the user of the frame cannot withstand the infection, they'll die soon after they're deployed.	2																					
94	94		301								Asimov	But attracting the Punishing Virus is the effect the Omega Weapon needs. That's the only way it can capture the virus.	1																					
95	95		301								Hippocrates	But where does it send the Punishing Virus?	2																					
96	96		301								Asimov	...We're still unable to explain most of it. Right now, all I can say is... the Omega Weapon functions more akin to a "tunnel" or a "wormhole" that pulls in the Punishing Virus.	1																					
97	97		301								Asimov	This frame has brought us hope precisely because it can make the Punishing Virus go away for real.	1																					
98	98		301								Asimov	With proper control, we can even cure the Corrupted.	1																					
99	99		204							2																								
100	100		301								Hippocrates	You won't be looking like this if things have been going this smoothly.	2																					
101	101		301								Asimov	...This specialized frame cannot control the rate it draws the Punishing Virus.	1																					
102	102		301								Asimov	Given the current virus concentration on the surface, it is very likely that the Omega Weapon cannot keep up with the amount the frame is drawing in.	1																					
103	103		301								Hippocrates	What will happen to the virus that the Omega Weapon cannot capture? Will they just infect Liv?	2																					
104	104		301									Asimov answers her with his silence.																						
105	105		301								Hippocrates	This is only going to give us another Corrupted. If things go wrong, we might even get another Ascendant.	2																					
106	106		301								Asimov	Commander Nikola agrees that we might risk turning Liv into an Ascendant. That's why he has asked the Purifying Force to support the operation.	1																					
107	107		301								Asimov	I was just confirming the situation with Bianca earlier. She's bringing over some... equipment tomorrow that requires special authorization.	1																					
108	108		301								Hippocrates	Equipment from the Purifying Force... a M.I.N.D. needle probe?	2																					
109	109		204							1	8																							
110	110		301								Asimov	And an EMP discharge collar.	1

113	113		301							1	Hippocrates	...	2																					
114	114		301								Hippocrates	Did he tell you about this?	2																					
115	115		203							2	0.25	400																						
116	116		201							1	1031001		-400																					
117	117		301							1	Liv	Yes. Asimov and Commander Nikola told me before we started the adaptation.	1																					
118	118		301								Hippocrates	Do you know what those two things do?	2																					
119	119		301								Liv	One of them monitors my M.I.N.D. activities, and the other one can directly extinguish my M.I.N.D.	1																					
120	120		301								Hippocrates	You signed the agreement after you'd learned about them?	2																					
121	121		204							1	19																							
122	122		301								Liv	I did... since I don't want to become the enemy either.	1																					
123	123		301									A hint of gloom flashes on the cheerful Professor's face, but she has not voiced any disagreement.																						
124	124		301								Hippocrates	What if we retrieve Liv before the infection crosses the threshold?	2																					
125	125		201							1	500004		-400																					
126	126		301							1	Asimov	Even with the specialized frame, the Omega Weapon cannot hold on for too long.	1																					
127	127		301								Asimov	Everything is a work in progress. We can only improve it after testing.	1																					
128	128		301								Hippocrates	Didn't you solve this once? With the Smith boy... Chrome?	2																					
129	129		301								Asimov	The way I solved that was by including an inhibitor so that the Ascendant data wouldn't surpass what he could handle.	1																					
130	130		301								Asimov	There are two reasons why we can't use an inhibitor this time.	1																					
131	131		301								Asimov	Drawing in the Punishing Virus is, by default, an act of surpassing the threshold. If we put a limit on that, this project wouldn't be able to do what it's meant to do.	1																					
132	132		301								Hippocrates	Hmm... Of course those people would come up with something like this when they consider human lives simply part of the cost of their experiments.	2																					
133	133		301								Hippocrates	But this isn't turning a heater on and off, where our options are either hot or cold, inhibitor or no inhibitor. There must be another way.	2																					
134	134		301								Asimov	There would be, but the specialized frame is developed from an agent's data, so its essence is similar to an Ascendant.	1																					
135	135		301								Asimov	Connecting with the M.I.N.D. of a frame like this often means corrupting a commandant's Mind Beacon.	1																					
136	136		301								Asimov	After getting the data from Chrome and the fight with the Hetero-Hive Mother, I reinforced the inhibitor on the Glory frame.	1																					
137	137		301								Asimov	Right now, his specialized frame is as stable as Arclight. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, both frames only have a 0.64% chance to deviate.	1																					
138	138		301								Asimov	But should a deviation occur, only the Gray Raven Commandant 【kuroname】 can stabilize his M.I.N.D.	1																					
139	139		301								Asimov	Given that 【kuroname】 is still in a coma, we've lost our only guarantee.	1																					
140	140		301								Hippocrates	Is that why Kurono is so obsessed with 【kuroname】?	2																					
141	141		301								Asimov	I wasn't too keen to find out the details, but it certainly seems like it.	1																					
142	142		301								Asimov	They have trouble solving the infection, and they couldn't get their hands on Constructs with remarkably stable M.I.N.D.s.	1																					
143	143		301								Asimov	Without a commandant who can withstand it, the frames they build can't be deployed, or it'll just result in the user's demise.	1

157	157		301								Hippocrates	Oh, how passionate young people are nowadays. I didn't even give him an answer, and he was showering me with praise for over ten minutes. And I thought my old researches were all but forgotten.	2																					
158	158		301								Hippocrates	People often ask me how I stay so young, but no one listens when I say it's healthy diets, enough sleep, regular exercise, and staying away from cigarettes and alcohol.	2

176	176		301								Asimov	The most important factors we considered were M.I.N.D. stability and strain.	1																					
177	177		301								Asimov	We have to exclude those who have their M.I.N.D.s damaged by a specialized frame—they would require something more stable.	1																					
178	178		301								Asimov	Among our top three candidates, Liv is second on the list.	1																					
179	179		301								Hippocrates	Oh? Who's first?	2																					
180	180		301								Asimov	Lee, who's also from Gray Raven.	1																					
181	181		301								Asimov	Still, this frame is just our first attempt. There is still a lot of uncertainty, but someone out there has been trying to suppress it.	1																					
182	182		301								Hippocrates	Someone, huh? I can hazard a guess who that is. Who knows, maybe we're talking about the same person. Were those the only things you considered?	2																					
183	183		301								Asimov	The other factor was the fact that Liv applied for the program herself.	1																					
184	184		301									Hippocrates lets out a deep sigh, switching to a more comfortable posture on the chair.																						
185	185		301								Hippocrates	Alright. I agree to join the operation.	2																					
186	186		301								Hippocrates	The agent's data would've caused all kinds of issues, even from the simulated connection during adaptation.	2
