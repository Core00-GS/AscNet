5	5		301			DialogEnable						As the night falls, the shallow sea engulfed in a thin mist begins to darken. The visibility is gradually diminishing, and an intangible fear begins to surge in every corner.																						
6	6		301								Purifying Force Member	...																						
7	7		401							2	1516																							
8	8		301									A Purifying Force soldier walks out of the fog. He slowly heads toward the water full of red and dark colors and cluelessly reaches out his hand, as if he is trying to touch the peaceful sea surface.																						
9	9		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiSHanshuoNew.prefab	2																							
10	10		301									Crimson tentacles suddenly rise from the water, gradually surrounding him. Several bright red spots also float to the fog-covered sea surface, catching the Construct soldiers off guard.																						
11	11		401							2	966																							
12	12		301									The Punishing Virus density detectors on the soldiers let off a loud alert, indicating the extremely high Punishing Virus concentration within the creatures hidden under these red spots. They are entirely made of the Punishing Virus, after all.																						
13	13		301								Purifying Force Member	...																						
14	14		301									The Purifying Force soldiers have not faltered at all. Instead, they take a step forward, holding up the flare sticks.

18	18		301									The bright light helps the Hetero-Creatures to easily locate their targets, but also exposes them to others that are still hiding in the fog.																						
19	19		401							1	111

25	25		301			RImgBg1Shake						Numerous bullets are coming from all directions. Some are fired from behind the rock, some from the shoal... A bullet fired directly behind the Purifying Force soldier barely misses his ear to hit the nearest Hetero-Creature.																						
26	26		401							2	970804																							
27	27		301									The Hetero-Creature tries to crawl up, but another lance suddenly comes out from the fog, piercing its "head"... Or the part that looks like a head.																						
28	28		301									After confirming the Hetero-Creature is completely silent, the lance is quickly drawn out and disappears in the fog again, awaiting its next victim. Efficient and fatal.																						
29	29		302								(This is how the Purifying Force fights...)	30																						
30	30		401							2	777																							
31	31		301									A gigantic Hetero-Creature slowly crawls out from the sea, making a low, terrifying sound. It seems to have absorbed an enormous amount of Red Tide to grow this big.																						
32	32		301									It swings its tide-like arm to crush all the Hetero-Creatures on its way, then raises the arm again to aim at the Purifying Force soldiers holding torches. Their weapons are unable to tackle an enemy of this size.																						
33	33		302								Freeze it, Lucia.	34																						
34	34		201							1	500166	5																						
35	35		301							1	Lucia	Understood!	1																					
36	36		401							2	10032209																							
37	37		301									In contrast to the Hetero-Creature's crimson color, an icy blue glow appears from the fog. The thrusters on Lucia: Plume's hands begin to run, creating a cyclone that sucks nearby fog in and converts it into a freezing chill.																						
38	38		302								Aim at the legs. Freeze the water all together!	40

41	42		401							2	10032505																							
42	43		301			RImgBg1Shake						Lucia nods and dashes to the large Hetero-Creature in no time, then leaps into the air using the thruster's power. She slams the thruster on the Hetero-Creature's leg, unleashing the extremely low temperature within.																						
43	44		401							2	3077																							
44	45		301									This hit alone cannot eliminate the large Hetero-Creature, but with its legs frozen, it can no longer maintain the balance of its gigantic body and falls on the sand.																						
45	46		401							2	777																							
46	47		301									It struggles to get up, but more lances appear and impale it to the ground. The agony makes it let out a human-like scream.																						
47	48		301								Purifying Force Member	Noisy bastard...																						
48	49		301									The Purifying Force soldier shoves a flare into the Hetero-Creature's throat. Its twisted face is lit up by the burning flames.																						
49	50		301									He stares at the Hetero-Creature for a few seconds as it gets burned in fire and healed by the Red Tide again. Curiosity appears on his poker face for the first time.																						
50	51		302								...Issarius!	52																						
51	52		401						500	2	1510																							
52	53		401							2	1510																							
53	54		301									He is slightly shocked when his name is called, then pulls out the anti-Corrupted large caliber gun to shoot at the Corrupted's head, until its so-called "head" completely vanishes on the sand.

55	56		401						300	1	36																							
56	57		401							1	203																							
57	58		301									As the fog gradually dissipates, other Hetero-Creatures also fall back to the sea. When the sea surface is peaceful again, other Purifying Force soldiers also come out from their hiding places while vigilantly searching for any remaining enemies.																						
58	59		301									Thanks to their caution, not many Purifying Force members are infected or injured, but the relentless battles over many days have made everyone's nerves extremely tense. Nonetheless, they have survived another night of Hetero-Creature attack.																						
59	60		301									After the battle, Lucia summons her thrusters back from the frozen sea. She wants to talk to the Purifying Force members, but only ends up returning in silence.																						
60	61		201							1	500166																							
61	62		301							1	Lucia	Commandant, are you okay?	1																					
62	63		302								Yeah. I'm all good.	64																						
63	64		301								Lucia	Great... I'm the only Gray Raven here with you. Lee knows a lot, Liv is a Support frame, but neither of them is here. If anything happens to you... I'll never forgive myself. Please tell me immediately if you aren't feeling well.	1																					
64	65		302								Don't worry. I just feel a little cold.	66																						
65	66		301								Lucia	Cold...? Should I give my coat to you, Commandant?	1																					
66	67		301									Noticing the thrusters covered in ice, Lucia suddenly realizes the "cold" came from herself. You were just telling a joke to make her relax a little bit.																						
67	68		204							1	2																							
68	69		301									She finally smiles and nods, then puts on a serious face before replying.																						
69	70		301								Lucia	"Commandant, since you were the one who gave the order, please bear with this for a little longer." I bet Lee would be saying this.	1																					
70	71		301									Lucia looks at the night sky as she returns the katana to its sheath. Perhaps Babylonia is right there in the space. Lee and Liv are waiting for them to return.																						
71	72		302								I deserve the cold, but the operation wasn't designed by me...	73																						
72	73		204							1																								
73	74		301								Lucia	I knew it... This plan is quite risky and feels nothing like what Commandant would choose.	1																					
74	75		301									The reticent Purifying Force member almost died in the dark sea, but he does not seem to be impacted at all. He is just quietly organizing his gear.																						
75	76		301									Each night over the past few days, many Hetero-Creatures would infiltrate the shoreline along the shoal, entering the land.																						
76	77		301								Lucia	The Purifying Force and we did our best to eliminate them... Still, a large number of Hetero-Creatures have broken through our defense and moved inland. If they ever find out occupied shelters or conservation areas, many innocent people will die.	1																					
77	78		301									Instead of fighting "alongside" the Purifying Force, they had been fighting individually most of the time... Members of the Purifying Force are never good at coordinated operations, let alone a large-scale defense battle.																						
78	79		202							1																								
79	80		301									Babylonia has already agreed to deploy Omega Weapons to contain and eliminate the Red Tide at the entrance to the sea, but getting such a large quantity of Omega Weapons and troops together needs at least several more days.																						
80	81		301									"My name is... Issarius. Tonight, I'll be the bait... You should also come and help."																						
81	82		301									A Purifying Force member came to Gray Raven's camp earlier this morning during his break. He left these words, then returned to his position without saying anything else.																						
82	83		301									It was quite rude by normal standards, but after spending a few days together, this could be considered hisâ€”or, the Purifying Force'sâ€”most genuine and sincere attempt of communication ever since Bianca left.																						
83	84		302								There were some ups and downs, but at least the result was good.	85																						
84	85		301									Issarius notices you are looking at him. He just nods in return.																						
85	86		301									It was the simplest bait strategy, but worked wonders. With the limited manpower available, this could arguably be the best plan to eliminate enemies in a large area... Except that nobody could ensure that he, as the bait, could survive.																						
86	87		301									You hardly agreed with such a dangerous plan, but could at least help with setting up the formation. With Lucia joining you, the chance of success was a lot higher.																						
87	88		301									Fortunately, you are able to hold the incoming Hetero-Creatures off the coastline as their number seems to be diminishing over time. Somehow, your instinct is warning you that a greater danger lies underneath.																						
88	89		201							1	500166																							
89	90		301							1	Lucia	Apart from Bianca... We don't really know the Purifying Force well.	1																					
90	91		302							1	Indeed...	92																						
91	92		301									Many Purifying Force soldiers vanished on this beach forever over the past few nights. You did not even know their names, but none of them showed any fear or hesitation.																						
92	93		301									â€”Perhaps they had already forgotten the feeling of fear during the countless purging missions.																						
93	94		401							2	2608																							
94	95		301									You are about to inspect the battlefield with Lucia, but suddenly feel a gust from the sea that brings a putrid, rotten smell. Not far away, Issarius suddenly gets on his feet, gazing into the distance.																						
95	96		202							1					1																			
96	97		401							1	36																							
97	98		301								Issarius	Over there...!

111	112		301			RImgBg1Shake						He calls out with a controlled voice as the ground begins to tremble. An enormous, pale figure rises from the center of the sea, sending crimson tides rushing toward the shore.																						
112	113		401							2	9327108																							
113	114		301									Sharp crystals formed by high-density Punishing Virus protrude from the water after the tides sweep past.

120	121		301									Lucia immediately rushes out after hearing the alert, activating Plume's quick frost power to freeze a large area of sea and buying time for the Purifying Force to fall back.																						
121	122		301									When everyone has moved to a higher ground, you finally have the time to observe what exactly the giant shadow is.																						
122	123		302								It looks... like a human.	124																						
123	124		201							1	500166	5																						
124	125		301								Lucia	Could it be a Hetero-Creature...? But this size is way too...	1																					
125	126		301									Issarius shakes his head and squints into the distance. Just like Lucia, he has never seen any monster like that before.																						
126	127		301								Issarius	I've never seen anything like this... But it seems quite challenging to kill.																						
127	128		301									The detailed origin of this monster is still unknown, but it is definitely linked to the Red Tide entering the sea.																						
128	129		301									Humans learned a hard lesson in the past battles. All tactics and weapons were futile against the Red Tideâ€”an amorphous monster that devours everything. But there is still one hope right now, which gives everyone a reason to keep fighting.																						
129	130		302								Lucia, contact Babylonia right now...	131																						
130	131		301								Lucia	Roger that! On it now...	1																					
131	132		301									Lucia nods and attempts to use her terminal to connect to Babylonia. The process only takes a couple of seconds, but it feels like centuries.

136	137		301							1	???	Hello...?	2																					
137	138		301								Lucia	This is Lucia from Gray Raven. As per the battle plan submitted to Lee earlier, Commandant, myself, as well as approximately 30 Purifying Force members are holding our position on the shore where Copperfield Aquarium was located.	1																					
138	139		301									Lucia looks back at the giant humanoid in the distance. It seems to be slowly approaching the coastline.																						
139	140		301								Lucia	We suspect an unknown mutation has occurred as the Red Tide gathers... A possible new Hetero-Creature of extremely large size has emerged. The potential damage could be devastating if it ever gets on the land.	1																					
140	141		302								We need reinforcements immediately!	142																						
141	142		301								???	Hah, what if I say no...?	2																					
142	143		302								W-what...?	144																						
143	144		301									The voice suddenly rings a bell. It's the red-haired captain of Cerberus.

152	153		301									The next moment, you hear Vera's furious shout from the terminal.

179	180		301							1	Vera	Well, it is from now. Captain's order.	2																					
180	181		302								What are they doing there...?	182																						
181	182		301									The other side of the terminal has turned into chaos, but Vera does not seem to care. She just casually tidies her hair and talks again as if nothing happened.																						
182	183		301								Vera	Ahem... This is Vera, captain of Cerberus. We have been requested by the HQ to assist Gray Raven in the siege of Copperfield Aquarium.	2																					
183	184		301								Lucia	How are the Omega Weapons, Vera?	1																					
184	185		301								Vera	They are sort of ready, but according to Asimov's estimate, for the Omega Weapons to contain and eliminate a Red Tide of this scale, they must be spread out and deployed in appropriate locations.	2																					
185	186		301									Thanks to Karenina and the Engineering Force's effort, Omega Weapons have entered mass production in the lunar base. But now that the lunar base is severely damaged, we must put them to the best use.																						
186	187		301								Vera	The Engineering Force worked overnight to install auto-drifting engines on some Omega Weapons. Once we put them in the sea, they will automatically head to the right position and activate. Unfortunately, we can't do so on the coastline and need to manually deploy them.	2																					
187	188		302								Manually... That's the most challenging part. We don't have manpower.	189																						
188	189		301								Vera	At least we'll be there when we finish setting up the Omega Weapons in the sea... That's all. Bye.	2

193	194		301									Although the Purifying Force has not suffered a great loss, most of the members have been wounded over the past few days of fighting.

201	202		301									A tall figure is rapidly sliding down the sand dune not far away. Under his feet is a greatsword that is almost as long as a person, which he is using as a sandboard.																						
202	203		301									No one else could have done this in Babylonia.																						
203	204		302								Kamui!	205																						
204	205		301			RImgBg1Shake						Despite his awesome stance, Kamui does not seem to know how to brake well. After spinning a few rounds on the sand, he finally comes to a halt by driving the greatsword into the sand.
