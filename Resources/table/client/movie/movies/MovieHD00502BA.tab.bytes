4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Lee	Next up is the Industrial Carriage in the middle of the train. Repairing it is crucial but dangerous, as the production system there is the second most critical part in keeping the train running, apart from its engine.	1																					
5	5		301								Lee	From the train's blueprint, we're eight carts away from the Industrial Carriage, excluding the corridors. We'll be going through the Commoner Carriage.	1

7	7		301									Lee clicks on the map, and a scan of the interior of the Commoner Carriage expands on the holo-screen.																						
8	8		301									Crowded and uncomfortable, rows of sleeping chambers stack against the metal walls of the carriage, and household items scatter everywhere, filling in every reachable gap, turning the cart into a giant hive.																						
9	9		301									The Heterozygotes lurk inside the carriage like caged beasts, their limbs twisting as they try to sniff out any prey, their bloodshot eyes hunting for any movement. It is all very unnerving to you.																						
10	10		301									No signs of human lives remain in the area. The scene depicted on the holo-screen is a living hell.																						
11	11		201							1	500026																							
12	12		301							1	Lee	The infection rate of the Commoner Carriage is extremely high. No signs of human activity and Inver-Device signal detected, and our initial scan shows the Punishing Virus concentration to be 2.429g/L.	1																					
13	13		201							1	1031001																							
14	14		301							1	Liv	It's the Commoner Carriage after the next cart...	1																					
15	15		201							1	500128	2																						
16	16		301							1	Bianca	Noted. I'm ready.	1																					
17	17		201							1	1021001																							
18	18		301							1	Lucia	I'll lead the way.	1

20	20		301								???	Hold on.																						
21	21		302								???																							
22	22		201							1	500127																							
23	23		301							1	Sophia	I'm coming with you.	1																					
24	24		302								Shouldn't you be on the repair team?	25	Why do you never make any sound when you walk?!	27																				
25	25		301								Sophia	Repair can't be done before we reach the Industrial Carriage.	1																					
26	26	29	301								Sophia	I'm familiar with this place.	1																					
27	27		301								Sophia	...I don't alert people.	1																					
28	28		301								Sophia	I know every inch of this place.	1																					
29	29		301								Sophia	I can help.	1																					
30	30		302								It's fine. Lee's got a map.	31	You're not an Attacker-type Construct.	31																				
31	31		301								Sophia	...Are you just going to stomp the front door?	1																					
32	32		302								Is there another entrance?	33	Ugh... sure?	33																				
33	33		301								Sophia	All automatic functions of the Commoner Carriage have failed.	1																					
34	34		301								Sophia	The doors of that cart are built differently. Before power is restored, you can only open them from the inside with brute force.	1																					
35	35		201							1	500026																							
36	36		301							1	Lee	So you can only enter the Commoner Carriage from the Noble Carriage, but not the other way around?	1																					
37	37		201							1	1021001																							
38	38		301							1	Lucia	I can break down the door.	1																					
39	39		201							1	500127	10																						
40	40		301							1	Sophia	...Repair team won't be happy if the train is damaged any further.	1																					
41	41		204							1																								
42	42		301								Sophia	If someone can reach the corridor to the next carriage, they can operate the doors manually from outside. It won't take more than half a minute for them to open.	1																					
43	43		201							1	1021001	3																						
44	44		301							1	Lucia	How do we do that?	1																					
45	45		201							1	500127																							
46	46		301							1	Sophia	Through the air vent.	1																					
47	47		201							1	1031001	7																						
48	48		301							1	Liv	...There is indeed an air conditioning system in the carriage. But the size of the vent...	1																					
49	49		201							1	500026																							
50	50		301							1	Lee	...It's only big enough for you.	1																					
51	51		302								We don't need help with one metal door, do we?	52	No way, this is too dangerous.	52																				
52	52		201							1	500127																							
53	53		301							1	Sophia	I want to go.	1																					
54	54		301								Sophia	I can help.	1																					
55	55		301								Sophia	I can fight.	1																					
56	56		202							1					1																			
57	57		301									Sophia pouts, standing before you like an unwavering young oak, leaving no room to compromise.																						
58	58		302								You're coming with us even if I disagree, aren't you?	59	I don't know why you insist on coming with us.	59																				
59	59		201							1	500127	10																						
60	60		301							1	Sophia	...	1																					
61	61		204							1																								
62	62		301								Sophia	Not going to watch while others fight again.	1																					
63	63		302								Fine. But you listen to my commands.	64	...I have no idea how to deal with you.	64																				
64	64		201							1	500026																							
65	65		301							1	Lee	At least it'll save us some time.	1																					
66	66		301								Lee	...For both the operation and the preparation beforehand.	1																					
67	67		201							1	1021001																							
68	68		301							1	Lucia	I'm good with that if you can follow orders.	1																					
69	69		201							1	500127																							
70	70		301							1	Sophia	I will!	1																					
71	71		201							1	500128	1																						
72	72		301							1	Bianca	Commandant, this kid is tougher than she looks.	1																					
73	73		201							1	1031001
