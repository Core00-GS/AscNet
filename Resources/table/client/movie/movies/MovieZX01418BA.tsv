3	3		301			DialogEnable				1		You shine a light on the surrounding area, but you still find yourself enveloped in darkness.																						
4	4		301								Rosetta	Your mech ejects the pilot in case of danger. Kinda lucky I managed to catch you before the cave collapsed, Commandant.																						
5	5		301									Right before the cave collapsed, Rosetta dropped her weapons and rushed over to protect you from the falling debris.																						
6	6		301								Rosetta	Are you hurt, Commandant?																						
7	1000		302								I'm okay.	7	What about you?	8																				
8	7	9	301								Rosetta	Thank goodness.																						
9	8	9	301								Rosetta	Not so lucky... My light wings are smashed, but everything else is in working order.																						
10	9		301									Rosetta squeezes out a smile to lighten up the atmosphere, but the situation is still dire. The cave seems to have entirely collapsed under the explosion, burying the production line and everything else in ice.																						
11	10		301									Being a Construct, Rosetta can shield you from the debris for a long period of time, but maintaining status quo does nothing to help the current situation.																						
12	11		301								Rosetta	Commandant, how do you think the ARU is doing... And Diana and the others too?																						
13	1001		302								They must have won.	12	They should still be good.	13																				
14	12	14	301								Rosetta	Yeah. They must have.																						
15	13	14	301								Rosetta	Yeah. We defeated Amberia, so the bionics should be pacified.																						
16	14		301								Rosetta	The past has finally been laid to rest. Amberia, Atiel... I don't know if I can prevent any further tragedies, but at least I have a way to end it.																						
17	15		301								Rosetta	Now we can move forward. It's all thanks to you, Commandant.																						
18	16		301								Rosetta	I wonder if the apology got through...																						
19	1002		302								Of course it did.	17	Why did you apologize?	18																				
20	17	22	301								Rosetta	That would be nice, then. I came to this answer after thinking about it a long time. The answer to end this nightmare.																						
21	18	19	301								Rosetta	Because that's what I'd like to hear, as well. Time weathers everything, after so long, the tangled knots of the past don't seem to matter much.																						
22	19	20	301								Rosetta	But when I revisit those memories... There is still this sliver of hope that, someone will knock on my door, and say...																						
23	20	21	301								Rosetta	—Sorry.																						
24	21	22	301								Rosetta	So I'm sure... The two must feel the same way I did.																						
25	22		301									Rosetta continues on, drifting through various topics, finding ways to keep your mind off the freezing weather and embolden your spirits.																						
26	23		301									But the end eventually comes. The cold air seeps through the debris and into the space of you and Rosetta. Oxygen grows thin and you find your thoughts growing muddled.																						
27	1003		301								Rosetta	Don't worry, Commandant. I will bring you back. I promised the Gray Ravens.																						
28	1004		302								Yeah.	25	But now...	25																				
29	25		301								Rosetta	Commandant, no, 【kuroname】. Do you know why I chose you, and why I asked you to help us move forward?																						
30	26		301									Rosetta throws another question at you, the one question that had lingered the longest in your mind.																						
31	27		301									Being a reinforcement operation approved by Nikola, Rosetta must have had numerous choices. She could have even requested for a solo operation.																						
32	28		301									But she did not. She walked over to you, and chose you.																						
33	29		301								Rosetta	I'm always down on my luck, but—																						
34	30		301									Rosetta mentions her misfortune once more, but she continues on.																						
35	31		301								Rosetta	The Constructs by your side... always seem so happy.																						
36	32		301								Rosetta	Even when misfortune befalls, they would never complain. They never show despair on their faces.																						
37	33		301								Rosetta	I feel warmth whenever I see you hanging out with your squad members. I thought, maybe I could learn something from you...																						
38	34		301								Rosetta	Say... the strength to press onward.																						
39	35		301								Staessen	Hey, I heard sounds up ahead. Get digging!																						
40	36		301								Rosetta	Huh?																						
41	1005		302								Huh?	37																						
42	37		301									An unexpected response interrupts the conversation, followed by the loose sound of ice crackling from above.																						
43	38		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Rosetta	Looks like... At least my hunch is right.

45	39		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						————																						
46	40		301									Those who dug out the escape route were members of the ARU hastily sent by Captain Staessen after the battle.																						
47	41		301									Staessen said he heard a huge explosion during the battle, so he accepted Simon's request and brought people for a search party. Finally, he found you here.																						
48	42		301									Boarding a rudimentary elevator, you finally return to the outside world.																						
49	43		301									The bionics that once attacked the ARU are now standing with the fishermen. The Forest Guards are establishing defenses at the nearby forest.																						
50	44		301									And Captain Staessen is taking care of Simon, sprawled on the ground like dried fish, with a disdainful look on his face.

52	45		301							1	Rosetta	...It's over.	1																					
53	51		301									The sun rises, gleaming in an almost palpable luster, inviting the beholders to share in its warmth.
