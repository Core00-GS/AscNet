3	3		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				Dear Selena, are you resting from your tiring journey when you receive this letter?	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
4	4		304							As I said, I'm trying to write a play, but it has proven to be more difficult than I imagined.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
5	5		304							It's a one-woman journey, a path laid with precursors' footsteps. But it's been so difficult to take the right turn.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
6	6		304							To provoke the emotions I wanted, I even did something akin to an "author"... and made a fool out of myself.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
7	7		304							I've attached my foolish deeds. If you see this, you can laugh at my mishap as a dear friend could.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
8	8		304							I must admit that these laughs attest to my apprehension as a young creator.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
9	9		304							Should I word it like that? Is that metaphor weird?	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
10	10		304							These questions of uncertainty pop up every so often in the process.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1		1																	
11	11		304							But the one thing that really shook me was a photo of you I just discovered when I was looking into the archives.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
12	12		304							It was a photo your mother took of you at the end of the premier night of "The Acadia Evacuation".	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
13	13		304							You were smiling, but you were more unsettled than I am now. You were even... panicking.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
14	14		304							What happened to you that day? What did you see?	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
15	15		304							You were unnerved by your own work... Why was that?	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1

20	20		301									Not something as official as a report nor as private as a diary. They're just words, like something you would say to a friend when you talked about your day.																						
21	21		301									I wish to record my current situation in the form of letters.																						
22	22		301									I'm currently at conservation area 184, near the old evacuation site during the Great Evacuation. As a member of the Archaeological Team... no, I myself have always wanted to visit this region.																						
23	23		301									Now, taking advantage of an expedition mission from WGAA, I've finally had the opportunity to visit this area after the red field subsided. Not just to study this place, but to commemorate a hero as well.																						
24	24		301									I thought I would be singing an ode for the hero or searching among the ruins outside the conservation area for the relics we couldn't bring to Babylonia all those years ago.																						
25	25		301									But here I am, finding myself before an unexpected audience.

32	32		301									Selena's hand stops as the cursive word flowing out of her pen reaches the end of its last stroke.

40	40		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Yes, I'm enjoying telling stories to the children here.																						
41	41		301									They were fairytales in the beginning, but we've somehow moved on to plays now.																						
42	42		301									What surprised me was how much the children here have an innate understanding of stories. Fairy tales or plays, they've more or less grasped the core emotions of them all.																						
43	43		301									Perhaps all children have the capacity for art. They're like seeds, waiting to be woken by spring.																						
44	44		301									It might be arrogant of me to say this, but I hope the stories I told here will bring them a puff of spring breeze.																						
45	45		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					I hope this breeze will reach all corners of this earth.

52	52		301							1	Girl	Huh... but that's not right.	1																					
53	53		301								Girl	Why would Prospero forgive his brother so easily?	1																					
54	54		301								Boy	Right? Antonio screwed him over! Why wouldn't he punish the bad guy?	2																					
55	55		202							1	2				1

57	57		301							1	Selena	Well... erm...	1																					
58	58		301								Selena	We'll have to start with the beginning of this character's arc... Right, an arc of a character is the gradual transformation of a character in the story.	1																					
59	59		301								Selena	About that... perhaps I shouldn't explain it outright. You will need to think about it yourselves.	1																					
60	60		201							1	500260																							
61	61		301							1	Girl	Huh? Why?	1																					
62	62		201							1	500430																							
63	63		301							1	Selena	Well... Stories don't come with correct answers.	1																					
64	64		301								Selena	If you can come to your own conclusion, it's perhaps a compliment to the storyteller as well.	1																					
65	65		301									She smiles at the children around her.																						
66	66		301								Selena	So‚Äîdo you want to listen to a song while you think?	1																					
67	67		201							1	500260																							
68	68		301							1	Girl	Yes! Please!	1																					
69	69		201							1	500430																							
70	70		301							1	Selena	Of course, of course. Now, if you would pay attention...	1																					
71	71		202							1					1																			
72	72		301									As Selena says that, her gaze lands on the crowd in the distance.																						
73	73		301									Conservation area 184 is situated near an old evacuation site of the Great Evacuation. Even when ravaged by war, the city nearby is still marked by artworks from the past. Refugees from that city also carry these marks as well.																						
74	74		301									After they were sheltered, the citizens here would share stories and rumors with the soldiers and vice versa, prompted by brief, chanced interactions. The children even said that operas from Babylonia would play here sometimes.																						
75	75		301									But right now, this is not a relaxed place with people exchanging tales. On the contrary, Selena can see the sadness that lingers on everyone's face.																						
76	76		301									A few weeks before her arrival, a moderate-sized battle took place here.																						
77	77		301									The despair on the people's faces echoes what has transpired.																						
78	78		301									They need the comfort that a child would need.																						
79	79		301									So Selena has chosen a lullaby.																						
80	80		301									She starts gently, like a mother rocking a baby's cradle.																						
81	81		301									As the song progresses, she increases her volume slowly, making sure her voice is carried beyond the children encircling her.																						
82	82		301									As the song quiets down, her voice still manifests brightly. Her gentle voice can calm every child it can reach.																						
83	83		201							1	500430																							
84	84		301							1	Selena	This... is a lullaby.	1																					
85	85		301								Selena	They are songs that comfort children... that comfort everyone.	1																					
86	86		201							1	500260																							
87	87		301							1	Girl	Will... Prospero hear it too?	1																					
88	88		201							1	500430																							
89	89		301							1	Selena	Perhaps Prospero needed a lullaby too... What kind of lullaby do you think he'd need?	1																					
90	90		201							1	500260																							
91	91		301							1	Girl	Hmm... I think a gentle one like the one you sang is enough.	1																					
92	92		201							1	500259																							
93	93		301							1	Boy	After all his adventures, he might need some compliments on top of comfort...	1																					
94	94		201							1	500260																							
95	95		301							1	Girl	That's not right...	1																					
96	96		202							1					1																			
97	97		301									Selena smiles, walking away from the group of children. They need a space where they can talk among themselves.																						
98	98		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					And she finally has a chance to head toward the person she has been searching for.																						
99	99		201							1	500430																							
100	100		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Selena	Excuse me. Are you Pieter?	1

104	104		202							1	2				1																			
105	105		301									The Construct soldier raises his head from maintenance and takes off his gears, revealing an aged, rigid face.																						
106	106		301									Selena salutes him.																						
107	107		201							1	500430		-450																					
108	108		201							2	500428		450																					
109	109		301							1	Selena	Nice to meet you. My name is Selena.	1																					
110	110		301								Selena	Babylonia has learned about what transpired during the battle near conservation area 184. You have been instrumental during the fight, leading a squad and carrying out a vital decapitation operation.	1																					
111	111		301								Selena	Your bravery was instrumental in preventing a catastrophe in the conservation area. Everyone alive here is grateful for your contribution. Babylonia recognizes your actions and would love to bring you up to commemorate you.	1																					
112	112		301								Pieter	It's my honor. I'll head up if I have time.	2																					
113	113		301									His response is simple and direct without a hint of joy. Selena gathers from his age that he is long used to commendation like this.																						
114	114		301									He does not stop speaking, however.																						
115	115		301								Pieter	A notice for commendation could've been done with comms. I wasn't expecting a person.	2																					
116	116		301								Pieter	The song you sang... that was your idea?	2																					
117	117		301								Selena	It was. I thought it would bring some comfort... in the most gentle way.	1																					
118	118		301									Away from the bonds and rules of the high-brow art world, Selena cannot help but relax in a simpler place like this, where she can be more direct about her intents and thoughts with others.																						
119	119		301								Selena	I worried that it would offend those of you who were on the battlefield... so I decided to sing to the children instead... hoping the song would reach your ears as well.	1																					
120	120		301									She looks to the side as she says that, and she thinks the furrowed brows of the sorrowful crowd have indeed eased a little.																						
121	121		301								Selena	Perhaps commendations and operas cannot heal the wounded and fight off the enemies... but if there are fighters who protect during battles, then there should be fighters who remember afterward.	1																					
122	122		301								Selena	Piro, the logistician. Bouvar, the scout. Celia, the analyst. And many, many others...	1																					
123	123		301								Selena	I was sent here to make sure they are not forgotten... to make sure their families and the people here understand what they have given.	1																					
124	124		301								Selena	So that the people who live can share the light and have their spirits soothed... This is what the commendation is for.	1																					
125	125		301								Pieter	...Is that so? You did well.	2																					
126	126		301									The veteran remains impassive, but his nod seems to suggest a compliment to Selena.																						
127	127		301								Pieter	You're Selena, right?	2																					
128	128		301								Pieter	I've heard of you. A rising star from WGAA... Wasn't expecting to find you here.	2																					
129	129		301								Pieter	Thank you, Selena. I've received your notification.	2																					
130	130		301								Pieter	I still have a mission coming up. Excuse me.	2																					
131	131		301								Selena	Of course... but please, one more thing.	1																					
132	132		301								Selena	You should know a man named Florance... He was a member of your team.	1																					
133	133		301								Selena	He assisted you in decapitating the target Corrupted during that battle. It was crucial to the outcome.	1																					
134	134		301								Selena	The children informed me that Florance joined the army because of an opera that moved him. As a fellow soldier and art lover, I wish to show my regard for his courage.	1																					
135	135		301								Selena	I was hoping to locate his family to deliver Babylonia's recognition to them while bringing comfort to his family and friends. Would you like to join me as his captain after you complete your mission?	1																					
136	136		301								Pieter	Of course. That's what I usually do.	2																					
137	137		301								Selena	Thank you very much. Would you mind telling me where he lived...	1																					
138	138		202							1	2				1																			
139	139		201							1	500259																							
140	140		301							1	Boy	I-I can show you the way, Miss.	1																					
141	141		301									Before she finishes speaking, Selena feels a small pull on her hand. She looks down and sees a boy grabbing her finger, pulling lightly.																						
142	142		301								Boy	Uncle Florance lived quite far away. If Uncle Pieter is busy, I-I can take you there...	1																					
143	143		301								Boy	If I take you, can you sing... that song again, Miss?	1																					
144	144		301								Boy	It's just that, my mom passed during the battle... Your song reminded me of the lullaby she sang me.	1																					
145	145		301								Boy	I... want to record the song so I can listen to it later. Is that alright?	1																					
146	146		201							1	500430	4																						
147	147		301							1	Selena	...Of course, dear. We can do this now.	1																					
148	148		202							1					1																			
149	149		301									A child's spirit is as delicate as an adult... and as resilient.																						
150	150		301									Selena looks at Pieter, who nods and turns to leave. As he said, he still has a mission to attend.																						
151	151		201							1	500259																							
152	152		301							1	Boy	F-for real? That's awesome! Let me find the recorder...	1																					
153	153		301									The boy takes out an old recording device from his large coat, rust staining its external speaker as a morning glory flower.																						
154	154		301								Boy	Uncle Florance made this himself. We all got one from him.	1																					
155	155		301								Boy	Hmm... I think I have to press this to start recording...	1																					
156	156		301									The boy finds a button on the device and presses it. Selena prepares to sing.																						
157	157		301									But instead of a notification that the recording is starting, what they hear is an aria.																						
158	158		301								Boy	Oh, that's not it... That's a song Uncle Florance recorded. Ugh, how do I stop this...	1																					
159	159		301									The boy fiddles with the recording device in a panic, but Selena catches his fluttering arms and holds them down.																						
160	160		201							1	500430																							
161	161		301							1	Selena	Hold on... please let me hear this.	1																					
162	162		301									She lowers her gaze, watching the recorder and frozen in place.																						
163	163		401							1	36																							
164	164		301									The boy assumes Selena is enjoying the opera recording, so he stays silent for a second before speaking quietly.																						
165	165		201							1	500259																							
166	166		301							1	Boy	Uncle Florance... loved this opera very much. He said that was what made him join the army in the first place.	1																					
167	167		301									The boy seems to be sharing with Selena how he feels and recalling what he was thinking the first time he heard this song.																						
168	168		301								Boy	I also like it a lot... It reminds me of what the grownups fighting the monsters outside the conservation area said... the reasons they fight.	1																					
169	169		301								Boy	What did Mom sacrifice herself for... What she was thinking before she stepped out and fought... I seem to understand a little bit more every time I hear this song...	1																					
170	170		301								Boy	That's... important.	1																					
171	171		201							1	500430	4																						
172	172		301							1	Selena	Oh... Is that so...	1																					
173	173		202							1					1																			
174	174		301									Selena answers briefly before turning her attention back to the aria.																						
175	175		301									It is a magnificent, flaunting melody. The singer's passionate voice evokes angry shouts at times and tearful cries at others. The two emotions interweave and linger on a thread called death‚Äîa lament for someone who passed.																						
176	176		301									The voice pushes and pulls, reaching high and low, finally approaching the climax‚Äî																						
177	177		301									And then a hand pushes the "stop" button hurriedly.																						
178	178		201							1	500259																							
179	179		301							1	Boy	Uncle Pieter?	1																					
180	180		202							1					1																			
181	181		301									The veteran, who was heading out for a mission, appears behind Selena out of nowhere.																						
182	182		201							1	500428																							
183	183		301								Pieter	Reed... your dad's looking for you. He needs your help... with your mother's things.	1																					
184	184		201							1	500259																							
185	185		301							1	Boy	Oh... oh. I'll get going.	1																					
186	186		301								Boy	Miss... can I come and find you later?	1																					
187	187		201							1	500430	4																						
188	188		301							1	Selena	Huh... Sure. Of course...	1																					
189	189		202							1					1																			
190	190		301									The boy packs up his recorder and leaves in a hurry.																						
191	191		301									Selena watches him go, but her eyes are not focusing on his figure‚Äînor anything else.																						
192	192		401							1	50																							
193	193		201							1	500430	4	-450																					
194	194		201							2	500428		450																					
195	195		301								Selena	Can I ask you a question, sir?	1																					
196	196		301								Pieter	...Shoot.	2																					
197	197		301								Selena	I heard what the boy played. It was a small part of an opera...	1																					
198	198		301								Selena	The boy said that Florance decided to join the army after hearing it...	1																					
199	199		301								Selena	I know that opera well... It's called "The Acadia Evacuation".	11																					
200	200		301								Selena	I wrote it.	1																					
201	201		204							2	8																							
202	202		301								Pieter	...Don't think too much of it. It was my fault that I couldn't stop him from sacrificing himself.	2																					
203	203		301									The veteran's voice is hoarse but his tone is soft.																						
204	204		204							2																								
205	205		301								Pieter	You should be proud of your talent. Your work was influential and powerful enough to carry on the legacy you claimed. You did everything you set out to do.	2																					
206	206		202							1	2				1																			
207	207		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Selena closes her eyes.																						
208	208		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
209	209		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						She hears the tempest.																						
210	210		301									She thought she had found the meaning behind her belief and her passion, with which she could build a ship that sheltered people from the storm, taking her through all the unknown tempests on the sea.																						
211	211		301									She never thought that the tempest would brew from what she loves.
