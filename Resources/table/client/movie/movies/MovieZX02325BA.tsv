4	4		301			DialogEnable						By the time the mourning crowd has departed, Babylonia has hung up the artificial night sky.																						
5	5		301									Liv's name is marked alongside many others within the code on the war memorial, allowing the visitors to learn about their stories.																						
6	6		301									The lives behind those names, both humans and Constructs, have used their bodies to mend the rifts caused by the war, paving a road for humanity's future.																						
7	7		301									The brightest day will eventually dusk, the river of time flowing toward a new night.																						
8	8		301									History of the world, then, goes back and forth between light and darkness. It had been this way, and it will be this way.																						
9	9		301									Underneath the bright, artificial moonlight, all but three remain before the monument.																						
10	10		301									They stare at the familiar name in silence, sharing neither tears nor words.																						
11	11		301									If the human among them had not passed out before dawn due to having just recovered, they would have stayed there until noon and beyond.																						
12	12		301									Heartbroken as they are, they will still visit tomorrow, even when their battles leave them no time to grieve.																						
13	13		301									The girl will lie in the eternal winter with countless others, dreaming about what could be as what once was.																						
14	14		301									There ends her journey. From then, it will be someone else's story.																						
15	15		301								Liv	...																						
16	16		301									Becoming a name on the memorial. Building a future with her past.																						
17	17		301									History never changes dramatically because of one person, but everyone can use their power to help lay the foundation of a future.																						
18	18		301									If the future is filled with difficulties, perhaps it is easiest for her to depart at her most glorious moment, no longer having to suffer any pain.																						
19	19		301								Liv	But...																						
20	20		301									Her heart still worries for her companions.																						
21	21		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The algorithm responds to her question and extends the scene onward.

23	23		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						A few days later, she sees a familiar figure.																						
24	24		301									It is Lucia.																						
25	25		201							1	500166	5																						
26	26		301							1	Lucia	...	1																					
27	27		301									Lucia places a sheep plush in front of the memorial before sitting down, as the place is empty at this late hour.																						
28	28		301								Liv	You look more like a wanderer than a soldier now. Is that how you are sometimes?																						
29	29		301								Liv	Lucia...																						
30	30		301									Lucia cannot hear the "past" calling for her. She just sits there, talking to herself.																						
31	31		301								Lucia	Liv, this is the second time I lost a teammate unprepared.	1																					
32	32		301								Lucia	I'm sorry, but the day you left... I was so angry. Not at you. I was angry at myself and those who withheld the truth...	1																					
33	33		301								Lucia	I could tell that it was part of Project Winter. But I only heard the truth about it when I brought you back here.	1																					
34	34		301								Lucia	But what happened to you... I don't know a better way.	1																					
35	35		301								Lucia	Commandant woke up a few days after you're gone... If you waited a little bit longer before coming for us, would you have lived?	1																					
36	36		301									Lucia shakes her head, answering herself.																						
37	37		301								Lucia	If you had done that, we would lose Lee, Chrome, Changyu, and Sophia.	1																					
38	38		301								Lucia	...And me.	1																					
39	39		301								Lucia	They were more injured than I was. I was the last one who could still move because they were guarding the way to me.	1																					
40	40		301								Lucia	And... in the end, you helped us destroy the twins.	1																					
41	41		301								Lucia	I've been thinking these past few days. If I could go back in time, what could I have done to protect you?	1																					
42	42		301								Lucia	...But I can't think of anything that would save you.	1																					
43	43		301								Lucia	Not unless I trade your life with others.	1																					
44	44		301								Lucia	But you wouldn't have wanted to see that.	1																					
45	45		301								Lucia	...	1																					
46	46		301								Lucia	Liv, do you know that Lee...	1																					
47	47		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Lucia does not continue.

49	49		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						A while after Lucia has left, another Construct stands before the war memorial.																						
50	50		201							1	500026																							
51	51		301							1	Lee	Liv.	1																					
52	52		301									He greets her before falling into a long silence as if all he has to say is being said wordlessly.																						
53	53		301									He only moves when the timer on his terminal rings, and he looks down, frowning.																						
54	54		301								Lee	I'm here to say goodbye.	1																					
55	55		301									He goes quiet again after that, considering for a moment. In the end, he chooses to leave those words unsaid.																						
56	56		204							1	10																							
57	57		301								Lee	Farewell.	1																					
58	58		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					All he thinks and feels are distilled into a simple goodbye, drifting away into the light casting in the square.																						
59	59		202							1					1																			
60	60		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						He never returns after that.																						
61	61		301									Has he disappeared, or is his path too far removed from what Liv can anticipate?																						
62	62		301									Time passes day after day. Every time the commandant and Lucia come to visit together, Liv can see the marks time leaves on the commandant's body.																						
63	63		301									Later, people begin to mention a snowstorm on the surface. It seems that a very difficult winter is coming.																						
64	64		301									After that, the commandant's name is put next to Liv's at a memorial service.																						
65	65		301									Then, their names are joined by Lucia's.																						
66	66		301									Many winters later, a young female Construct stands before the monument, someone Liv does not recognize.																						
67	67		201							1	500415																							
68	68		301							1	???	Hello, Liv.	1																					
69	69		301								Cosette	Do you remember me? I'm Cosette. You saved me when I was a baby.	1																					
70	70		301								Cosette	...	1																					
71	71		301								Cosette	They told me that my parents thought I'd be a genius. That was why they risked their lives delivering me to you.	1																					
72	72		301								Liv	...No. That wasn't...																						
73	73		301								Liv	All they wanted was for you to be happy...																						
74	74		301								Liv	They wanted to give you the choice to choose your future...																						
75	75		301									But the young Construct cannot hear Liv. She continues.																						
76	76		301								Cosette	But what have I achieved? I'm just a Support-type Construct that can't do anything well...	1																					
77	77		301								Cosette	All of you must be so disappointed if you were here.	1																					
78	78		301								Liv	Of course not... This is not what they wanted...																						
79	79		301								Cosette	What were my parents like? Why did they bring me into the world?	1																					
80	80		301								Cosette	Tell me, please...	1																					
81	81		301								Liv	...	1																					
82	82		202							1					1																			
83	83		301									Cosette has lost everyone she held dear this long winter. She no longer has anyone to talk to.																						
84	84		301									The young Construct, all alone, talks before the monument, until her words turn into tears.																						
85	85		301									As the Construct cries, the scenery around her slowly fades into a thick, white fog.

95	95		301							1	Liv	Is this the future I have been looking forward to?	1																					
96	96		301									It is easier to rest eternally in death than to bear all those sufferings and pains.																						
97	97		301								Liv	But I find it colorless and cold...	1																					
98	98		202							1					1																			
99	99		301									"A more painful way, then?"
