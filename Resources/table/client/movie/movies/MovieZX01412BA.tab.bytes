5	5		301									Walking into the entrance, everyone arrives at a strange underground world.

9	8		301							1	Rosetta	That must be the where our enemies came from... No wonder the numbers don't match up.	2																					
10	9		301								Diana	That doesn't make sense, though. Why would such a large cave go undiscovered for this long...?	1																					
11	10		301								Rosetta	Must be some sort of interference. Look up there‚Äîthe strange lights. They must be some sort of signal jammer.	2																					
12	11		301								Diana	They'd put so much effort into burying their past mistakes and building this military base, instead of trying to rebuild the ARU...	1																					
13	1002		302								Because they had war in mind.	12	That's all in the past.	14																				
14	12	13	301								Diana	Yeah... The captain said that Amberia and the bionics were built for war from the start.	1																					
15	13	16	301								Rosetta	From the looks of this cave, you can see the true intent of the ARU's leadership. They never swayed from their belief that war was the final solution.	2																					
16	14	15	301								Rosetta	Yeah, Diana. All in the past.	2																					
17	15	16	301								Rosetta	Whatever the past mistakes, let's try our best to make amends.	2																					
18	16		301								???	Oh, how very deep and all, Forest Guards. Ah, „Äêkuroname„Äë, you as well.																						
19	1003		302								Who are you?	17	Who's there?!	18																				
20	17	19	301								???	Oh, wha... Oh. Wait. I don't think we ever met.																						
21	18		301								???	Well, well.																						
22	19		301									An unfamiliar female voice warbles through the air, nauseous and muffled like noise.																						
23	20		301								Lamia	Self-intros are annoooyiiing, but I guess I'll still go through with it... My name is Lamia, an Ascendant.																						
24	21		301								Rosetta	First Alpha, now Lamia? Do you Ascendants think you can stroll in and out of the ARU, just as you please?	2																					
25	22		301								Lamia	Well, we just needed something here... That's all.																						
26	1004		302								Are you the one behind all of this?	23	Where is Atiel?	26																				
27	23	24	301								Lamia	Oh, you are such a funny little tart... Didn't you just arrive at your answer? It's all the ARU's fault.																						
28	24	25	301								Lamia	Whether it's the bionics that are attacking the ARU,or the Amberia buried in this place‚ÄîI've got nothing to do with 'em.																						
29	25	28	301								Lamia	I'm just a little spectator. That's all.																						
30	26	27	301								Lamia	Oh come on, little pumpkin, you know the answer.																						
31	27	28	301								Rosetta	Which means... you have Atiel.	2																					
32	28		301								Lamia	I'm only here for Amberia. We've got enough juice, so after she's fully charged, we can make her go beep-boop with the code, and... voila!																						
33	29		301								Lamia	Then Amberia will be under my control. After which...																						
34	1005		302								You're just telling us that?	30	Can't you just use the virus to control her?	31																				
35	30	32	301								Lamia	...I'm not tryna tell you, you're the brutes who barged in on me talking to myself! Hmph!																						
36	31	32	301								Lamia	...Asks all the wrong questions‚Äîcheck.																						
37	32		301									Lamia cuts the broadcast. Bionics begin pouring out of the dark recesses of the cavern.

45	35		301								Diana	Corrupted and Ascendants... Is that Lamia trying to turn the ARU into Kowloong...?	1																					
46	36		301								Rosetta	We're here to prevent that from happening. Let's break through their forces and continue downward, Commandant.	2
