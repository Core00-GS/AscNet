4	4		301									Roland reaches out to the rusty gate.																						
5	5		301									The dust-covered bolts are moved, leaving a circle of light yellow ashes between the inner and outer rings.																						
6	6		301									The dilapidated frames give a horrible squeak, as if they are fighting the power that is about to change them.																						
7	7		301									Eventually, they succumb to the power and give in to the new visitor.

13	13		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Roland walks into the front yard, a space that resembles a time capsule.																						
14	14		301									Rough pottery pieces are scattered under the wall. Firewood chips are neatly placed next to a smashed fireplace wall, as if they were just freshly chopped in the morning.																						
15	15		301									The ground surface is in extremely poor condition due to lack of maintenance, but tools are nicely placed along the wall.																						
16	16		301									Everything about this place shows that someone used to live here, albeit a long time ago.																						
17	17		301									Roland calmly walks through it, until he sees a crude clay plate at an inconspicuous place on the outside wall.																						
18	18		301									—"This is the home of Luna and Lucia, built by Daddy and Mommy together!"																						
19	19		301									A complex emotion has grasped Roland. Many scenes have come to his mind.																						
20	20		301									Perhaps she used to toddle from the living room to the kitchen, carrying a basket full of freshly picked potatoes.																						
21	21		301									Perhaps she used to rush from the first floor to the second, holding a paperplane that Dad made while making a "whoosh" sound.																						
22	22		301									Perhaps...																						
23	23		301									Luna was once here, and she left. If she really had come back for some reason...																						
24	24		301									But she is now lost. None of the "perhaps" can change this fact.																						
25	25		201							1	500334																							
26	26		301							1	Roland	...Better get back to the topic.	1																					
27	27		301								Roland	Why would they lure Babylonia's Task Force to this place, and why do they want me to come here.	1																					
28	28		301								Roland	There should be an answer to all these questions.	1																					
29	29		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Roland starts to carefully search every nook and cranny of the ruins.

35	35		202							1					1																			
36	36		301									Lamia notices a wandering phantom on the street.																						
37	37		301									It travels through the streets without concealing its action, kicking the corner of walls, or spraying something on the wall with its head every now and then.																						
38	38		201							1	500165																							
39	39		301							1	Lamia	...What... is... that?	1																					
40	40		301									Lamia watches it until it disappears after turning around a corner.																						
41	41		301									But she soon hears engine sounds from where it disappears, and sees a black figure rising to the sky.																						
42	42		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Lamia trembles at the somewhat familiar sight.

49	49		301									But after giving away Huaxu's key, she has no asset left.																						
50	50		301									If she is caught... She will be doomed.

55	55		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		Roland has been wandering around in the house for a while, he thinks he has checked almost all the possible places.																						
56	56		301									—But he still has no clue about what to do next.																						
57	57		301									He steps into a destroyed bathroom in the hope that "something may happen if he tries to do something."																						
58	58		301									Most of the things inside are demolished, except the large mirror. It is surprisingly intact apart from one long, horizontal crack.																						
59	59		301									Only traces of history remain in this place. He can peek into Luna's past, but cannot reach the present.																						
60	60		301									Can he really find clues of Luna here? Before this, how long has he travelled? How many options has he ruled out?																						
61	61		301									This pursuit almost took his life in the underground waterway.																						
62	62		301									No matter what, he probably won't find anything useful from this mansion of the past on his own.																						
63	63		301									—Still, it cannot explain why the other two groups also have their eyes on this place.																						
64	64		301									Or... Could it be just the result of an incorrect decision, or a foolish mission from Babylonia?																						
65	65		301									If that's the case... Where should he go next? What is he going to look for?																						
66	67		301									Roland looks at his somewhat unfamiliar black body in the mirror. He cannot help but feel a little sentimental, for too many people and things have changed.																						
67	69		201							1	500334																							
68	66		401							1	36																							
69	70		301							1	Roland	I didn't realize... Is this what I look like now?	1

74	74		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The Roland in the mirror becomes smudged with gray, while the red color is replaced by yellow.																						
75	75		301									Roland sees what he used to look like.																						
76	76		301								Roland?	Hermano.																						
77	77		301								Roland	Did anyone ever tell you that you looked extremely annoying?																						
78	78		301								Roland?	Never by myself.																						
79	79		301								Roland	Coming out at such an awkward timing... What do you want?																						
80	80		301								Roland?	You are too painful to watch. I need to teach you a lesson.																						
81	81		301								Roland	...																						
82	82		301								Roland?	"Roland", use your brain and think—who on earth are you?																						
83	83		301								Roland?	An actor? A knight? A stray dog? An Ascendant? Luna's loyal servant?																						
84	84		301								Roland?	Stop lying to yourself.																						
85	85		301								Roland?	You are just who you are.																						
86	86		301								Roland?	You aren't anyone else. You aren't an item. You are just yourself, the one and only you in this world.																						
87	87		301								Roland?	Go onward, and one day you will be able to answer me—who are you?																						
88	88		301								Roland?	Your ideals, your recognition, your violence, your cunning.																						
89	89		301								Roland?	Maybe you need someone to rely on, some belief to follow, or a mission to give you a reason to live on.																						
90	90		301								Roland	...And what does that have to do with my current situation?																						
91	91		301								Roland?	I'm just reminding you that in this show, you can do a lot more than you think.																						
92	92		301								Roland?	You may have been a little lost after losing your direction...																						
93	93		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland?	But you are unique. There's no one else like you in this world.

97	97		301								Roland?	Do you seriously think you can get what you want by giving trust to others? This cruel world doesn't run that way.	1																					
98	98		301								Roland?	The world doesn't disappear even when the symbol is gone. The world is still there, so are the things represented by that symbol.	1																					
99	99		301								Roland?	Whether you understand or not, just remember what I said.	1

102	102		301									Roland stands in front of the mirror and clenches his fists.

112	112		301								Roland	If they want to bring the Task Force and us together and watch us kill each other, I need to set up some distractions.	2
