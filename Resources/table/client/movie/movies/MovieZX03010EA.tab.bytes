3	3		301			DialogEnable						The storm is about to end. Someone is dragging their feet on a secluded beach, slowly coming near.

5	5		301							1	Vanessa	I knew they would be fighting... The scale is pretty large.	1																					
6	6		301									She gazes into the distance. Her eye seems wounded and squints in the day-breaking sunlight.																						
7	7		301									Many Hetero-Creatures are crawling out of the sea, charging toward the people on the coastline. But they seem to be stopped by something invisible and can hardly reach their targets.																						
8	8		301								Vanessa	Are those Omega Weapons...? I've never seen them before, but that person did mention them.	1																					
9	9		301									She points at the temporary command center in the center of the battle line.																						
10	10		301								Vanessa	That symbol must be Gray Raven's.	1																					
11	11		301								Vanessa	Not just them... Strike Hawk, Cerberus, Engineering Force... Even Dark Aries is here.	1																					
12	12		204							1	13																							
13	13		301								Vanessa	Can't believe Babylonia has thrown in so many forces. That "Chief" is definitely not holding back, just as always.	1																					
14	14		204							1																								
15	15		301									She knows very well that those forces weren't recruited by the Gray Raven Commandant. They just naturally gathered around that person to fight together.																						
16	16		301								Vanessa	Let's go meet them, Bambinata.	1

19	19		301							1		Bambinata quickly comes to her, supporting Vanessa's disabled body with her own.																						
20	20		301									Just then, Bambinata suddenly sees a crimson figure who looks completely out of place.																						
21	21		203							1	0.12	200																						
22	22		203							2	0.12	-200																						
23	23		301								Bambinata	Mistress!	2																					
24	24		301			RImgBg1Shake						Bambinata quickly pulls Vanessa behind herself, blocking the Hetero-Creature's attack.

27	27		201							1	500523																							
28	28		301							1	Teasell	Do you really have to block that with your own body?	1																					
29	29		201							1	500536																							
30	30		301							1		Hearing the young male's voice, the petite Bambinata kicks the Hetero-Creature away and dodges its attack. She returns to Vanessa while remaining alert.

32	32		401							2	970804																							
33	33		301									Before the Hetero-Creature can growl again, an arrow has pierced its throat and pinned it on a tree trunk. It immediately turns into a pond of crimson liquid.																						
34	34		301								Bambinata	...Thank you.	1																					
35	35		301									Bambinata nods at the young male, then looks back at the female behind her. She is obviously thanking him for saving her mistress, not for helping herself.

41	41		301							1		Teasell glances at Vanessa from the corner of his eyes. He tells himself that the terrible scars on her face were only a result of her own wrongdoing.																						
42	42		301								Teasell	Sending you here is the last mercy I have for you, Vanessa.	1																					
43	43		203							1	0.25	-400																						
44	44		201							2	500537		400																					
45	45		301							1	Vanessa	I know. You've said it so many times.	2																					
46	46		301									Vanessa smiles, but this time there is no sarcasm in her words, only slight grief.																						
47	47		301								Teasell	Alright, I've got to go.	1																					
48	48		301								Vanessa	Wait. There is one last thing.	2																					
49	49		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Teasell	...?	1
