8	7		301									They change as you start charging, and now you find yourselves amidst a confrontation.																						
9	8		301									Many of them are significantly damaged by you, but they still manage to block you from the few that remain in human form, who are still keeping the ritual running.																						
10	9		301									A dark mist begins to appear. It still needs a catalyst to display its true form, which the cultists are about to provide.

18	16		301									Ayla swings her scythe hard, tossing it toward the ritual.

56	50		301								Narration	Your performance was way too good, even the narrator was rendered speechless. He has almost forgotten the one and only purpose—																						
57	51		301								Narration	There is no metal plate, because I'd like to tell you the good news myself. You have proven yourselves and do not need a letter of invitation.																						
58	52		301								Narration	Instead, the last test will be available whenever you are ready, students.																						
59	53		301								Narration	Keep up the good performance, and Director Toro will be satisfied. The winner from you will take over his legacy.																						
60	54		301									After the narration, you find an ordinary wooden door in front of you.
