3	3		301			DialogEnable						When an infiltration devolves into a game of cat and mouse, the one at a disadvantage is always the one with fewer preparations.																						
4	4		301									—Just like Murray right now, and the pursuer behind him.																						
5	5		301									Murray chucks another defensive program behind him, marking the imminent end of the weapon stock he prepared.																						
6	6		301									The only one left is a virtual grenade, but Murray knows better than to rely on a measly grenade to get rid of his pursuer.																						
7	7		301									Not to mention that the pursuer is at a close five-meter distance behind him.																						
8	8		301									That is not Murray's only concern. His terminal also shows a M.I.N.D. signal closing in from his left.

10	10		301							1	Murray	Whoever you are, you must be professionals.	1																					
11	11		301								Murray	Either I escape in a minute, or I get caught...	1																					
12	12		301									Suddenly, the path before Murray collapses and transforms.																						
13	13		301									A concrete pipe is now jutting out of the wall, presenting an entryway to Murray.																						
14	14		202							1					1																			
15	15		301									Without a second thought, Murray leaps into the pipe and slides into the unknown depths beneath.																						
16	16		301									The pursuer, not one to give up, immediately dives for Murray, but—																						
17	17		401							2	10007502																							
18	18		301			RImgBg1Shake						A massive explosion flattens the entrance of the concrete pipe, completely burying the path.																						
19	19		301									With the target lost, the pursuer can only roll to the side to slow down.																						
20	20		301									Beside her, air flickers in scale-like shadows, slowly revealing a humanoid shape.																						
21	21		301								Yata	What do we do? Should we just blow up everything down there?																						
22	22		301								Valeria	...That's not in our mission. Let's retreat for now.																						
23	23		301								Yata	...Roger.																						
24	24		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Valeria	If the invader is leaving virtual space through the place we know about, then we can intercept in person.

27	27		301									Sweating profusely, Murray rips the sweat-soaked mask terminal from his face.

29	29		301							1	Murray	Phew... Good thing I made it.	1																					
30	30		301									He removes the memory drive from the terminal and pockets it.																						
31	31		301									In a camera blind spot, Murray silently kicks another memory drive to an inconspicuous corner.																						
32	32		301								Murray	If our two big fellas are going to duke it out on an info war, then I'll even the playing field for both of you. Treat it as my thanks for all the troubles you gave me.	1																					
33	33		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Kicking the terminal inside another hidden spot, Murray stands and leaves.

40	39		301								Celica	But... why do it in Commander Nikola's name?	2																					
41	40		301								Hassen	It's okay. He'll gladly accept it.	1																					
42	41		301								Celica	What are the two of you planning...?	2

47	45		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Humming a little tune in his memories, Murray strolls through the vast corridor of Babylonia.																						
48	46		201							1	500146																							
49	47		301							1	Murray	A few accidents, but, looks like I made it.	1																					
50	48		301									The pale blue hologram of Earth glimmers on the ceiling. Tiny specks of light are crawling around on the globe.																						
51	49		301									Playing around with a silver data chip, Murray's eyes quickly scan through the corridor.																						
52	50		301									A series of rooms, all with holographic labels on their doors, enter his vision.																						
53	51		301								Murray	Strike Hawk, Cerberus, Egret...	1																					
54	52		301								Murray	Ouroboros, Swallowtail...	1																					
55	53		301									Silently going through the squad names and passing by countless doors, Murray finally reaches his destination and stops.																						
56	54		301								Murray	Gray Raven, there you are.	1																					
57	55		301									Murray's humming shifts in tone. The calm, minor chord trickles down into a low and resonant buzz.																						
58	56		301									He swipes the chip before the door, and it opens with a light beep.

62	60		204							1	1																							
63	61		301								Murray	End of your shift, Officer.	1																					
64	62		301								Liaison Officer	Huh? But I didn't receive any orders from President Hassen.	2																					
65	63		301								Murray	Of course, because this is a direct order from Commander Nikola.	1																					
66	64		301									Murray sends an encrypted file to the terminal of the liaison officer. After reading through the file, the officer salutes Murray and leaves the room silently.

69	67		301									Now finished with the bass portion of his tune, it begins lilting into a flourishing melody when Murray suddenly pauses.

71	69		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Murray	This chorus is meant for two people...	1

73	71		204							1																								
74	72		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						A sullen expression flashes shortly past Murray's face. It is gone by the time he raised his head to check the data panel before him.																						
75	73		301								Murray	No time to waste here. Getting this identity as a liaison officer has cost me quite a few moves.	1																					
76	74		301								Murray	But, it can't be helped. Only by doing so can I get in touch with the Gray Ravens quickly.	1																					
77	75		301								Murray	This mission isn't like the ones before. Who knows what might happen to Lee...	1																					
78	76		301								Murray	Proposing a new trade with Commander Nikola after getting rid of Scarab was the right play.	1																					
79	77		301								Murray	But man, his permit sure is pricey.	1																					
80	78		204							1	1																							
81	79		301								Murray	Commander, though... Let's see if you can handle the payment I gave you.	1																					
82	80		301									Murray's usual smile returns. His fingers dance quickly on the data panel.																						
83	81		301								Murray	Given the prowess of Gray Raven, they will likely be assigned the most difficult missions.	1																					
84	82		301								Murray	To help their commandant out, let's get the Kurono equipment I received from the last trade installed.	1																					
85	83		301									A tiny black dot appears on the holographic display before Murray.																						
86	84		204							1																								
87	85		301								Murray	Built for stealth, efficiency, and safety... Don't let me down.	1																					
88	86		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					The black dot fades into the hologram as if nothing were there.
