10	10		301								Construct Soldier	You are "Death"... You're here to kill me!	1																					
11	11		202							1					1																			
12	12		301									The Construct soldier knows his fate and gives up struggling the moment he sees Vera. The Punishing Virus easily breaks his infection threshold, turning him into a Corrupted.																						
13	13		201							1	500168	13																						
14	14		301							1	Vera	Yeah, you are right... So, farewell.	1																					
15	15		301									Vera's katana pierces through the Corrupted's chest, soaking her in vital fluid that is still warm. She closes her eyes and smiles in solitude.

28	28		301								No. 21	Okay. Also, "don't get caught if we're doing bad things."	1

30	30		301								Noctis	Don't you dare run away, No. 21! I installed the test weapon on your junk robot because you promised you would help me move stuff.	2																					
31	31		204							1	4																							
32	32		301								No. 21	How stingy, Noctis. Don't grow up to be like him, Buddy.	1																					
33	33		301								Noctis	Huh? What's wrong with being like me? So mighty and strong!	2

37	37		202							1					1																			
38	38		301									After sending them away, Vera realizes a crowd has gathered nearby. They all seem to be Construct soldiers of the Task Force.																						
39	39		301									Vera hates crowds. She has no interest in joining them until she hears a Construct squad talking excitedly to their peers nearby.																						
40	40		201							1	500019																							
41	41		301							1	Construct Soldier	It's Lloyd! "The Undying Loy" is back!	1																					
42	42		301									Vera looks at the center of the crowd and sees the "hero" that she once met.																						
43	43		201							1	500348	4																						
44	44		301							1	Lloyd	...Ravaged by the Punishing Virus, the Earth is full of deadly infections and Corrupted. We were forced to abandon the surface and fall back to Babylonia.	1																					
45	45		301								Lloyd	But can we just keep running all the time? We can run to the Moon, to Mars. Do we still have the guts to call ourselves humans after leaving behind everything we've ever valued?	1																					
46	46		301								Lloyd	Maybe we couldn't see any hope in the past. But now, things have changed...	1																					
47	47		301									Vera slowly walks near the crowd. The soldiers all seem to be focusing on Lloyd's speech. None of them notices her.																						
48	48		301								Lloyd	We are one step closer to reclaiming Earth. The HQ, the Support Force, the Science Council, and we soldiers from the Task Force... everybody is doing their best as part of humanity.	1																					
49	49		301								Lloyd	We have begun to strike back. We are recovering conservation areas and destroying Corrupted hives. One day, we will be able to return to Earth and recapture our homeland with our very own hands.	1																					
50	50		204							1	1																							
51	51		301								Lloyd	Thanks to recalling, we no longer have to fear death or injuries. Each and every one of us can live to witness the day when we take back Earth.	1																					
52	52		202							1					1																			
53	53		301									The soldiers' cheering and discussions make Vera feel like laughing.																						
54	54		201							1	500168	13																						
55	55		301							1	Vera	Tsk... How ironic...	1																					
56	56		301									Vera has had enough. She wants to push a way out, but her shoulder is hit by another Construct soldier who is trying to force his way in.																						
57	57		202							1					1																			
58	58		301									He squeezes through the crowd until he stands in front of Lloyd. The look on his face is too eager for a random passer-by.																						
59	59		201							1	500019																							
60	60		301							1	???	Lloyd! It really is you... You have recalled back to Babylonia.	1																					
61	61		301									Lloyd is a little caught off-guard, but still keeps his signature smile.																						
62	62		203							1	0.25	400																						
63	63		201							2	500348	1	-400																					
64	64		301							1	Lloyd	Excuse me... Do I know you?	2																					
65	65		301								???	The name's Huck, you probably don't remember me... But what about Yanna? You must still remember her, right? We were from the same squad...	1																					
66	66		301								Huck	Our squad was surrounded by Corrupted in a battle not long ago... Most of us managed to evacuate, but you were protecting Yanna and didn't leave with us.	1																					
67	67		204							2																								
68	68		301									Lloyd's smile freezes. The soldier named Yanna does ring a bell, but he has no memory about her ending.																						
69	69		301									Every mission record of "Lloyd" must be uploaded to the headquarters, so Lloyd has access to almost all the memories and combat data collected in the past.																						
70	70		301									But he does not remember Yanna at all. The only possibility is the "Lloyd" in the past never had a chance to backup the memories.																						
71	71		301								Huck	Now that you have recalled back to Babylonia, Yanna must be back too, right? Have you seen her?	1																					
72	72		301									But he must bring hope to people, even a false one. He must play the hero named "Lloyd". He is used to telling lies, both to others and himself.																						
73	73		301								Lloyd	Um, of course... She...	2																					
74	74		202							1	2				1																			
75	75		201							1	500168	1																						
76	76		301							1	Vera	Yanna...? Hah, I think I remember that name...	1																					
77	77		301									Vera follows Huck out of the crowd, interrupting Lloyd.																						
78	78		201							1	500019		400																					
79	79		201							2	500348	4	-400

83	83		301								Huck	Vera... Aren't you "Death"? Do you know Yanna...? Wait, why would you know her?	1																					
84	84		202							1	2				1																			
85	85		201							1	500168	1																						
86	86		301							1	Vera	I remember my mission targets well. How strange is that?	1																					
87	87		204							1																								
88	88		301								Vera	Unlike you losers who know nothing but running away, I always make sure to complete my missions.	1																					
89	89		201							1	500019																							
90	90		301							1	Huck	What do you mean...?! Where's Yanna?!	1																					
91	91		202							1	2				1																			
92	92		401							1	203																							
93	93		201							1	500168																							
94	94		301							1	Vera	The M.I.N.D. infection level of that Construct named Yanna was way over the threshold before the recall. She turned into a Corrupted, so‚Äî	1																					
95	95		201							1	500019																							
96	96		301							1	Huck	So you killed her?!	1																					
97	97		201							1	500168	13																						
98	98		301							1	Vera	That's our job, isn't it? Are you saying that you couldn't do it if it was you?	1																					
99	99		301								Vera	If that's the case, I suggest you leave the army, otherwise you will get others and yourself killed.	1

103	103		301									The furious Huck pounces on Vera, but she comes prepared and kicks his supporting leg, striking him off-balance. Before he can react, Vera punches him in the chest, knocking him to the ground.																						
104	104		301								Huck	You... cold-blooded... monster!	1																					
105	105		301									Huck throws a hateful stare, but Vera holds the cold edge of her blade tightly against his throat. She gives a condescending grin.																						
106	106		301								Vera	Listen, the recall cannot save your *** all the time. You losers could have died anytime in the battlefield.																						
107	107		301									Vera raises her katana, slowly pointing it at everyone around.																						
108	108		301								Vera	Why don't you just die here instead of becoming a new Corrupted? At least I can give you a quick and easy death.																						
109	109		401							1	212																							
110	110		301									Vera's words have apparently infuriated all the Constructs, but none of them dares to step forward. Nobody wants to have anything to do with "Death".																						
111	111		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lloyd	Enough! Miss Vera... that's enough.																						
112	112		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory263.png																								
113	113		201							1	500168	13																						
114	114		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Vera	So you're that so-called "hero," huh? Pretty impressive. Hope I don't have to kill you one day.	1																					
115	115		204							1																								
116	116		301									The crowd is triggered once again, ranting all sorts of accusations. But Vera does not seem to be concerned.																						
117	117		301								Vera	Now get lost...	1																					
118	118		301									She runs her eyes over the crowd, then steps back and puts her katana back into the sheath before walking straight through the group. Unsurprisingly, not one of them dares to stop her.																						
119	119		201							1	500348	6																						
120	120		301							1	Lloyd	Miss Vera...	1																					
121	121		301									Vera walks away. Lloyd watches the crimson Construct disappear in the darkness, but he cannot forget her words.																						
122	122		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Only Lloyd understands what Vera truly means.
