4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Hassen	This is an impromptu internal meeting. Everybody, please keep all the information mentioned in this meeting confidential.	1																					
5	5		301									After the disaster broke out at the Pulia Forest Park Ruins, the council members have already participated in countless impromptu meetings.																						
6	6		301									An impromptu meeting used to mean an emergency. Now, it also means a difficult dilemma to overcome.																						
7	7		301								Hassen	As everyone knows, the situation on Earth is taking a turn for the worst.	1																					
8	8		301								Hassen	The high Punishing concentration has caused varying degrees of evolution in Hetero-Creatures across the different regions.	1																					
9	9		301								Hassen	They have learned to attack in groups. If they are injured, they quickly retreat and regroup in the Red Tide.	1																					
10	10		301								Hassen	Those winged Hetero-Creatures have increased their flight speed and altitude, allowing them to attack transport crafts.	1																					
11	11		301								Hassen	However, our forces stranded on the surface have been unable to stop the twins from advancing. For now, they can only withdraw.	1																					
12	12		301								Hassen	The CPF has been destroyed, the greenhouse collapsed, and the blood of the dead has turned into the Red Tide, breeding new enemies.	1																					
13	13		301								Hassen	We have made great sacrifices to resolve this disaster with little to show for it.	1																					
14	14		301								Hassen	If this continues, everything that has been restored on the surface will be in vain.	1																					
15	15		301								Hassen	We need something that can turn the tide in our fight against the Punishing Virus.	1																					
16	16		301								Hassen	Preliminary research on the Omega File 【kuroname】 obtained from Atlantis is beginning to show progress.	1																					
17	17		301								Hassen	The "Omega Prototype" produced by the Science Council has been proved to be capable of absorbing the Punishing Virus.	1																					
18	18		301								Hassen	However, it is unable to change the overall environment at its current stage. I propose that we focus all of Babylonia's resources and research into this program.	1																					
19	19		301									Upon announcing the topic for this meeting, Hassen opens the floor for discussion, but no one in the dark room voices their opinion.																						
20	20		301								Hassen	We need to put aside our differences and focus our efforts on solving this crisis immediately.	1																					
21	21		201							1	500138																							
22	22		301							1	Councilman A	Is this really a wise use of our resources?	1																					
23	23		301								Councilman A	Babylonia can be completely self-sufficient so long as we control our consumption and cut supplies for troops on the surface.	1																					
24	24		201							1	500012																							
25	25		301							1	Nikola	That may be the case, but is it sustainable?	1																					
26	26		301								Nikola	Our current crisis isn't just the high Punishing concentration on the surface, but also Ascendants infiltrating Gestalt and the Hetero-Creatures to obtain air superiority.	1																					
27	27		301								Nikola	Not to mention the emergence of the twins. What makes you think they won't continue to evolve?	1																					
28	28		201							1	500138																							
29	29		301							1	Councilman C	We should at least come up with a concrete method for solving this crisis before we discuss putting all of our eggs in one basket.	1																					
30	30		201							1	500012																							
31	31		301							1	Nikola	We've already devised a method.	1																					
32	32		301								Nikola	However, this method requires assistance from "Project Winter" to achieve the maximum effect.	1																					
33	33		301									Uttering these two words causes whispers to echo throughout the dimly-lit council.

38	38		301							1	Councilman E	According to my knowledge, the Science Council has also dabbled in "Project Winter".																						
39	39		202							1	2	3			1																			
40	40		201							1	500012																							
41	41		301							1	Nikola	However, those conservatives have only been committed to enhancing the stability of specialized frames. They haven't expanded their efforts into controlling the Punishing Virus.	1

46	46		301							1	Councilman H	Controlling the Punishing Virus...?																						
47	47		301									The councilman looks at President Hassen sitting silently in front of him.																						
48	48		301								Councilman H	I'm sure you are aware that based on the current progress of "Project Winter", the specialized frames designed with the "latest" data have serious defects.																						
49	49		301								Councilman H	They're similar to an Ascendant frame by actively gathering the Punishing Virus within the frame and the user's M.I.N.D.																						
50	50		301								Councilman H	However, since the user isn't an Ascendant, they can't resist the Punishing Virus nor can they control the frame.																						
51	51		301								Councilman H	Anyone who switched to the "new" specialized frame was unable to persist in actual combat. They couldn't even last twenty minutes on the surface before succumbing to corruption.																						
52	52		301								Councilman H	Even if we can somehow delay corruption, there will still be serious damage to their M.I.N.D.																						
53	53		301								Councilman H	Commandants sacrificed their lives to stabilize their M.I.N.D.s as a result of Mind Beacon pollution.																						
54	54		301									Some of the councilmen who had already receded into the shadows show no intent on hiding their position. As a result, he takes the initiative to express their position and voice their concerns.																						
55	55		202							1	2	3			1																			
56	56		201							1	500012																							
57	57		301							1	Nikola	Even if the Punishing Virus cannot be controlled for now, we can resolve issues with corruption by using the "Omega Prototype".	1																					
58	58		301								Nikola	As for M.I.N.D. corruption, leave that to the CTO.	1

62	62		301							1	Asimov	...	13																					
63	63		301								Asimov	During the battle with Alpha and Huaxu...	13																					
64	64		301								Asimov	Huaxu assumed direct control over Commandant 【kuroname】 of Gray Raven, forcibly connecting the commandant with nearby Corrupted.	13																					
65	65		301								Asimov	I don't need to reiterate the effects on most commandants when they link with Corrupted, but the symptoms of 【kuroname】 weren't as serious.	13																					
66	66		301								Asimov	The three other Constructs of Gray Raven were able to maintain a secure link with 【kuroname】 despite the corruption.	13																					
67	67		301								Asimov	Lucia, Liv, Lee, and Chrome who has upgraded to his specialized frame. They've all achieved a level of M.I.N.D. stability capable of handling specialized frames.	13																					
68	68		301								Asimov	However, due to the instability of this new specialized frame, Constructs that have already been affected by their specialized frame are not fit for this dangerous mission.	13																					
69	69		301								Asimov	So... That just leaves Lee and Liv.	13																					
70	70		202							1					1																			
71	71		301								Councilman H	But 【kuroname】 has declined to participate in "Project Winter".																						
72	72		201							1	500352		-600																					
73	73		301							1	Hilda	That depends on the content of the project.	1																					
74	74		301								Hilda	【kuroname】 and Gray Raven defeated the Polyphage and retrieved the files from Atlantis. Heroes who've garnered such attention shouldn't be used as test subjects.	1																					
75	75		301									Hilda deliberately mentions the word "heroes" to remind those hiding in the shadows that, even if Earth is fraught with disaster, they can't continue to operate in secret.																						
76	76		301								Hilda	The Control Court will supervise this collaboration to ensure the personal safety of 【kuroname】, who will not participate in any research other than that which pertains to linking with the new specialized frames.	1																					
77	77		202							1					1																			
78	78		301								Councilman J	Gray Raven is still performing missions on the surface while 【kuroname】 is in a coma.																						
79	79		301								Councilman J	Based on the current situation, transport crafts are unable to safely reach the surface, let alone escort Gray Raven back to Babylonia.																						
80	80		201							1	500011		-600																					
81	81		301							1	Hassen	This is what we will discuss next.	1																					
82	82		301								Hassen	There is an underground base that belongs to Kurono in City 047 where a large number of resources, transport crafts, and a spaceship are stored.	1																					
83	83		301								Hassen	If permissible, we can retrieve 【kuroname】 and the two other Constructs from Gray Raven.	1																					
84	84		301									Whispers begin to circulate among the Parliament.																						
85	85		202							1					1																			
86	86		301								Councilman H	Have you tested the "Omega Prototype" yet?																						
87	87		301								Asimov	We've successfully run simulations, but we haven't deployed it on the surface yet.	13																					
88	88		301								Councilman J	If we can obtain test results regarding its effectiveness against the twins, both sides should be in more equal standing.																						
89	89		201							1	500012		-600																					
90	90		301							1	Nikola	Correct. However, we must take it one step at a time.	1																					
91	91		201							1	500011		-600																					
92	92		301							1	Hassen	Given the sacrifice required for a round-trip journey to the surface, they can't be expected to pay with their lives for a test that doesn't yield results.	1																					
93	93		202							1					1																			
94	94		301								Councilman H	Once they return to Babylonia, what will you do if 【kuroname】 doesn't begin to improve?																						
95	95		201							1	500012		-600																					
96	96		301							1	Nikola	We will wait until 【kuroname】 shows signs of improvement before proceeding. If the commandant doesn't regain consciousness, we will think of another plan.	1																					
97	97		301								Nikola	If there is any hope of averting this disaster, we will change our plans accordingly.	1																					
98	98		301									The council looks at Hilda, but she remains silent and acquiesces to the other result implied by Nikola's phrasing.																						
99	99		301									This desolate world no longer leaves any room for tenderness.																						
100	100		202							1					1																			
101	101		301								Councilman V	We're going to wait until 【kuroname】 shows signs of improvement before conducting the experiment?																						
102	102		201							1	500011		-600																					
103	103		301							1	Hassen	The situation on Earth is taking a turn for the worst.	1																					
104	104		301									President Hassen reiterates his opening statement.																						
105	105		301								Hassen	If you want to leave researchers time to start their work, this situation demands an immediate course of action.	1																					
106	106		202							1					1																			
107	107		301								Councilman V	Even if we manage to mitigate corruption, without a Mind Beacon that can withstand pollution, specialized frames will be difficult to maintain.																						
108	108		204							13	8																							
109	109		301								Asimov	Correct. Current data predicts that, if we cannot resolve issues with M.I.N.D. stability, the subject will die within three hours of participating in actual combat.	13																					
110	110		202							1					1																			
111	111		301									Hearing such a minuscule amount of time, everyone's whispers turn to an outcry. However, a council member hiding in the shadows gives a pleasant look of surprise.																						
112	112		204							13																								
113	113		301								Councilman V	Can't believe they lasted three hours without a commandant to maintain stability...																						
114	114		301								Councilman H	Is that it?																						
115	115		301								Councilman V	What do you mean, "is that it?" Last time when we used Lu... Ahem, the specialized frame developed with the new data couldn't even pass the corruption test.																						
116	116		301								Councilman V	Even though "they" had "acquired" data from Glory, then implemented numerous barriers and restrictions...																						
117	117		301								Councilman V	But without a commandant that can resist pollution from Mind Beacons, or someone able to maintain M.I.N.D. stability like Chrome, it was just a useless shell.																						
118	118		301								Councilman V	Even for someone to last just one minute as a human bomb proved to be a disaster.																						
119	119		301								Councilman V	This is just the first deployment, yet they've already managed to last 3 hours in the simulation. Imagine what we can achieve with such a project in the future with the combined effort of all departments.																						
120	120		301								Councilman V	I can't wait to see her smile at the results.																						
121	121		301								Councilman V	The underground base in City 047 is a major asset and property. But the higher-ups shouldn't refuse such a rare invitation from the Parliament.																						
122	122		301								Councilman H	Hmph... Even now, they won't put down their hypocritical masks. What's wrong with making sacrifices for the sake of science?																						
123	123		301								Councilman J	But only 3 hours... Isn't this experiment a little inhumane?																						
124	124		301								Councilman B	To think you know what "inhumane" even means... Have you finished cleaning up the aftermath of all those deaths? Or are you being sarcastic?																						
125	125		301									The centrist councilman retorts sarcastically, unable to remain silent any longer.																						
126	126		201							1	500012		-600																					
127	127		301							1	Nikola	I will arrange for remunerations. Being concerned with personal sacrifices would be an insult to everyone who is still struggling, as well as the soldiers and civilians who died in the disaster.	1																					
128	128		202							1					1																			
129	129		301								Councilman J	Is there a specific plan to integrate the "Omega Prototype" with specialized frames??																						
130	130		301								Asimov	Yes, but it is currently top-secret.	13																					
131	131		301								Councilman J	Then how can you verify the efficacy of such a plan?																						
132	132		201							1	500012		-600																					
133	133		301							1	Nikola	Each party must first negotiate its conditions before verification can be made by both parties.	1																					
134	134		202							1					1																			
135	135		301								Councilman H	Can the Science Council guarantee results from this collaborative effort?																						
136	136		301								Asimov	This is just our preliminary course of action. I still haven't received the agent data and we still need to conduct more tests before making any conclusions.	13																					
137	137		201							1	500011		-600																					
138	138		301							1	Hassen	If we want to improve our current predicament, we have only one choice—cooperation.	1																					
139	139		301								Hassen	In any case, this is the beginning of hope.	1																					
140	140		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					...But it is only just the beginning.
