11	9		301									Simon, neither a Construct nor piloting a Polar Soldier, had no choice but to hitch a ride on Diana.																						
12	10		301									Upon reaching the base, Simon could no longer hold his grip and tumbles off of Diana, rolling onto the ground.																						
13	1003		302								Are you okay?	11	Didn't you go through training in Babylonia?	12																				
14	11	3000	301								Simon	Phew... I-I just need a quick breather...	1

17	13		301									Before he could finish, he signals for a open path and scurries behind the shade. By the look of things, he is likely going to be out of action for some time.

24	16		301									Captain Staessen pushes his way from out of the crowd. Handing over the command to one of his subordinates, he begins to shake Atiel vigorously.																						
25	1008		302								Calm down!	17	Derek's voice is the code.	19																				
26	17	18	301								Staessen	How can I calm down at a time like this? Do you know how dire the situation is? What on earth is the code to control Amberia?!	1																					
27	18	20	301								Rosetta	It's Derek. More specifically, it's his voice.	2																					
28	19	20	301								Staessen	Derek... You mean that mechanic narwhal?!	1																					
29	20		301								Staessen	Wait... Why is that mechanical narwhal's voice the code? They're using a voice to control Amberia?	1																					
30	21		301								Rosetta	I can't tell what they were thinking either, but I'm afraid it's true. Derek's voice is specifically designed to resonate with the frequency of humanoid-hybrid M.I.N.D.s.	2																					
31	22		301								Staessen	How is that possible?	1																					
32	23		301								Rosetta	You must know what I mean, Commandant. You saw it firsthand.	2																					
33	1009		302								Our last time in the ARU...																							
34	24		301								Rosetta	Yeah. Derek's voice was the main reason I wasn't taken by the virus. I didn't realize at the time, but looking back, Derek may be the key to everything.	2

39	1013		201							2	500214	4	400																					
40	26		301							1	Staessen	The ebb and flow of the tide... You mean, that narwhal is the key to putting Amberia to rest?	1																					
41	27		301								Rosetta	Looks like it...	2																					
42	1014		302								Where is Derek now?	28	Will Derek be returning soon?	29																				
43	28	31	301								Staessen	...Who knows where that blasted narwhal is!	1																					
44	29	30	301								Rosetta	He usually shows up at about this time, so he should have. We all assumed it was part of his migration cycle, but this time, Derek is running late.	2																					
45	30	31	301								Rosetta	As a result...	2																					
46	31		301								Rosetta	Derek might be malfunctioning. The reason being...	2																					
47	1015		302								α	32																						
48	32		301								Rosetta	That must be it. Alpha had her eyes on Derek during her last visit, and in trying to "tame" him, she must have caused a system malfunction.	2																					
49	33		301								Staessen	Then what do we do? No Derek, no code...	1																					
50	1016		302								Evan has the code.	1017

67	40		301							1		Before you could react, Evan has already fallen to the ground. A familiar female Construct has snatched the voice player around his neck, radiating a terrifying smile on her face.
