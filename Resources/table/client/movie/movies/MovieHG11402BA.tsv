4	4		301							1	Rosetta	The field survey mission is divided into several stages. We will need to make several trips, and even need to stay overnight in the wilds.	1																					
5	5		301									After the mission began, Rosetta took you to a snowfield some distance from the ARU. Here, you see a vast expanse of snow adorned with several lonely-looking trees.																						
6	6		301								Rosetta	So I was thinking, you should familiarize yourself with life in the Arctic.	1																					
7	7		302								I have to survive out here?	8	I've read about it before in the files.	9																				
8	8	10	301								Rosetta	Quick on the draw as always, Commandant.	1																					
9	9		301								Rosetta	That's not the same. True knowledge is acquired by applying them in the field.	1																					
10	10		301								Rosetta	So, to better complete our mission... Our first step is to build a fire.	1																					
11	11		301								Rosetta	Out in the wild, one's ability to start a fire is the difference between life and death. I'm sure you get the gist, Commandant.	1																					
12	12		302								Yeah.	13	Starting a fire isn't that hard.	14																				
13	13	15	301								Rosetta	Do you really? I'm talking about the primitive way of building a fire.	1																					
14	14		301								Rosetta	Obviously, with the help of tools. But Forest Guards prefer to do it the natural way.	1																					
15	15		301								Rosetta	Generally speaking, other than the basic materials, the Forest Guards gather tinder and firewood from the surrounding area.	1																					
16	16		202							1																								
17	17		301									At which point, Rosetta begins collecting branches and arranging them into a pile.																						
18	18		201							1	500214	1																						
19	19		301							1	Rosetta	Which reminds me, us Forest Guards have a custom for building a fire to welcome newcomers. You aren't exactly wet behind the ears, but let's not pass up the opportunity.	1																					
20	20		301								Rosetta	Think you can help me collect firewood, Commandant?	1																					
21	21		302								I have to help in my own welcome party?	22	Sure. I'm interested in this welcoming.	24																				
22	22		204							1	8																							
23	23	25	301								Rosetta	The Forest Guards aren't exactly some easygoing organization. A lot of things you still need to do yourself.	1																					
24	24		301								Rosetta	Thanks. It's just another custom of ours. I'm not sure if it'll live up to your expectations, Commandant.	1																					
25	25		202							1

27	27		301									——																						
28	28		401							2	1514																							
29	29		301									After searching the area, you find enough firewood to build a fire.																						
30	30		201							1	500214																							
31	31		301							1	Rosetta	These branches aren't exactly ideal for firewood, but they should still get the job done.	1																					
32	32		301									Ensuring the firewood is sufficiently dry, Rosetta clears away a patch of snow. To your puzzlement, Rosetta lets out a sigh of relief at the sight of dirt beneath.																						
33	33		301								Rosetta	Thankfully, it's not ice underneath...	1																					
34	34		302								You weren't expecting ice, were you?	35	Is there normally a lot of ice?	36																				
35	35	37	301								Rosetta	No, but that would've been just my luck. Just in case.	1																					
36	36		301								Rosetta	No, but it always seems to be the case for me.	1																					
37	37		301								Rosetta	Looks like you might be my lucky charm, Commandant. Had I known this, I would've teamed up with you during the card game.	1																					
38	38		302								Why were you playing card games with them?	39	I don't really know how to play.	40																				
39	39	41	301								Rosetta	Because it's fun and I like the artwork, of course. But with my luck, I always end up drawing the wrong cards.	1																					
40	40		301								Rosetta	The rules of the game are fairly simple. You'll learn them soon enough.	1																					
41	41		301								Rosetta	Anyway, let's get this fire started first.	1																					
42	42		202							1																								
43	43		301									Rosetta fishes out a flint rock and strikes it a few times to light up the lower layer of the firewood.																						
44	44		401							2	213																							
45	45		301									The embers slowly grow into a flame as they eat up the firewood, converging into a warm bonfire shortly thereafter.																						
46	46		201							1	500214																							
47	47		301							1	Rosetta	Now it's time for your welcoming.	1																					
48	48		202							1																								
49	49		301									Once the bonfire is burning at a steady pace, Rosetta gestures you to sit by the fire and slowly leans over.	1																					
50	50		201							1	500214																							
51	51		302								Wha?!	52	Is this... the welcoming?	53																				
52	52	54	301							1	Rosetta	Careful, you don't want to kick the bonfire.	1																					
53	53		301								Rosetta	Yeah, I've never done this for an outsider. Guess I need some more practice.	1																					
54	54		202							1																								
55	55		301									Rosetta takes you by surprise as she approaches, but she does not seem to pay any mind.																						
56	56		301									Rosetta continues, inching closer and closer, her breath almost palpable...																						
57	57		301									But just then...

60	100		401							1	102																							
61	60		201							1	500214	4																						
62	61		301							1	Rosetta	An earthquake!?	1																					
63	62		301									The sudden tremors stop Rosetta in her tracks. Following the direction of the rumbling, you see a giant ten-meter tall snowball rolling your way.																						
64	63		302								What's that?!	64	Run, Rosetta!	65																				
65	64	66	301								Rosetta	I don't know, but let's get out of here!	1																					
66	65		301								Rosetta	Roger. Let's over to the trees!	1																					
67	66		202							1																								
68	67		401							2	1503																							
69	68		502							RImgBg1Shake																								
70	69		301									Thanks to your quick reaction, you and Rosetta avoid disaster. However, the same cannot be said about your hard-earned bonfire which is swept away by the snowball, leaving not so much as a trace.																						
71	70		301									...																						
72	71		302								...	72																						
73	72		401							2	1514																							
74	73		301									Rosetta is taken aback by the strange happening. Shortly after, you hear familiar footsteps—hoofsteps—coming from the direction of the snowball.																						
75	74		201							1	500088	4																						
76	75		301							1	Diana	Oh? Rosetta and 【kuroname】? What are you two doing here?	1																					
77	76		302								We were just starting a fire.	77	What are you guys up to?	81																				
78	77		201							1	500214																							
79	78		301							1	Rosetta	Well, I was going to give Commandant a small welcome before the mission began, but I wasn't expecting a snowball to come flying out of nowhere.	1																					
80	79		201							1	500088	4																						
81	80	84	301							1	Diana	That was probably a snowball we made for building a snowman. It didn't destroy your bonfire... Did it?	1																					
82	81		201							1	500088																							
83	82		301							1	Diana	The ARU is on holiday today, so I asked some members to build a snowman with me. But I didn't think the snowball would get so big that it'd roll away.	1																					
84	83		301								Diana	Which is why I'm here, looking for it. Did you see it go by?	1																					
85	84		201							1	500214																							
86	85		301							1	Rosetta	...	1																					
87	86		204							1	8																							
88	87		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Rosetta	It really isn't my lucky day...	1
