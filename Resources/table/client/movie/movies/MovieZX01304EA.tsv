17	16		301				PanelActor1Shake			1		Roland raises his hand and is about to speak, when suddenly the mysterious man behind him breaks free of his Corrupted restrainers. He bolts and flees inside the theme park.

19	18		202							1					1																			
20	19		301									Even with Liv's emergency treatment, it is still quite a mystery as to how such a heavily damaged Construct can run so fast.

27	26		301								Roland	Right now, though, you folks are the main dish.	1																					
28	27		302								Hard to say who's the main dish here.	28																						
29	28		301								Roland	Oh, yes, reminds me. You people did beat me quite a number of times.	1																					
30	29		301								Roland	Which is why, strictly speaking, I'm not the actual one to take care of you people.	1

56	55		301									Roland utters the foreign syllables softly, soundless to the point that you only see his lips parting.																						
57	56		301			RImgBg1Shake						But in the communications channel, his words echo, amplifying and drowning out every frequency. The sound reverberates, until the syllables themselves become indiscernible.																						
58	57		301									The signal did cause certain interference for the Constructs, but not enough—they are still holding their weapons tightly.

121	119		301									...																						
122	120		301								Asimov	Well, well. We have quite the situation on our hands. Nothing's wrong with Kamui.	1																					
123	121		301								Asimov	This bloke's consciousness has simply been sealed in his M.I.N.D.	1																					
124	122		302								?!	123																						
125	123		301								Asimov	Simply put, you can't access his M.I.N.D. whether through hardware or software. Guy's consciousness is completely stand-alone now.	1																					
126	124		301								Asimov	Which also means that, Kamui's consciousness cannot access his body, so his frame is frozen in the state right before he got closed off.	1																					
127	125		302								How did Roland do that?	126																						
128	126		301								Asimov	Not sure. Might be some new tech they gleaned off of that "Huaxu" from Kowloong...	1																					
129	127		301								Asimov	If you don't bring him back to Babylonia for emergency treatment, his frame won't just be useless, but the stability of his consciousness will also be jeopardized.	1																					
130	128		302								Stability... jeopardized?	129																						
131	129		301								Asimov	Pah, didn't you learn this in the F.O.S. courses?	1																					
132	130		301								Asimov	If a consciousness remains isolated from other conscious individuals for an extended period of time, their thought model stability deteriorates. The self crumbles, eventually becoming nothing.	1
