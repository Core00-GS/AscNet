5	5		301									Lee takes over the small robot and puts it in his toolbox.																						
6	6		302								My marksmanship is as good as it ever is.	7	I learned it from the best, Lee.	8

9	9		301								Lee	Shut up.	1																					
10	10		201							1	500166	2																						
11	11		301							1	Lucia	We still have some work left to do. How about you go out for another walk?	1																					
12	12		201							1	1031001	1																						
13	13		301							1	Liv	No. I think it's best that I stay here and help.	1																					
14	14		302								Well, there isn't any other place for us to go anyway.	15																						
15	15		201							1	500166	2																						
16	16		301							1	Lucia	Alright. Area E3 is still waiting for you to plant something. Do you want to head there?	1																					
17	17		302								Sure.	18																						
18	18		201							1	1031001	1																						
19	19		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Liv	Yes. Let's go.	1

22	22		401							2	885																							
23	23		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Driving a transport vehicle, you deliver the seedlings to Area E3. The soil here has been plowed by gardener robots.																						
24	24		302								Let's get to work.	25																						
25	25		201							1	1031001	1																						
26	26		301							1	Liv	Alright.	1																					
27	27		202							1					1																			
28	28		401							2	655																							
29	29		301									You open the hatch of the transport vehicle and activate it. Then, the gardener robots start planting the seedlings as they are programmed.																						
30	30		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					It's just like Lucia said. This isn't much of a job, really. You just have to wait here and make sure nothing goes wrong.																						
31	31		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory527.png																								
32	32		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You watch the robots work and wait for 2 hours. The sun is already setting. Having nothing better to do, the two of you start chatting.																						
33	33		201							1	1031001	1																						
34	34		301							1	Liv	The soil of this garden still has the roots of some plants left in it.	1																					
35	35		302								I think wild plans used to grow here.	36																						
36	36		301								Liv	Yes. Plants are resilient. During those years when things just started to get better, wild plants had already been growing in most ruins.	1																					
37	37		301								Liv	For those who visit the amusement park for fun, these plants aren't exactly beautiful... And it can take time and effort to take care of them.	1																					
38	38		301								Liv	That's why someone has to re-plant them...	1																					
39	39		301									The girl looks at the crowd in the distance with a peaceful smile on her face. Those people seem to be having a lot of fun.																						
40	40		301								Liv	Do you feel bored doing such a tedious job?	1																					
41	41		302								It's fine.	42	I don't mind so long as we are together.	42																				
42	42		301								Liv	Right...	1																					
43	43		204							1																								
44	44		301								Liv	Do you remember? Things weren't like this in the first place.	1																					
45	45		302								I can barely remember that.	46																						
46	46		301								Liv	Had things gone the other way, you and Lucia would've been sent to a place far away to clear out potential threats. Lee would be assigned to a school to teach math. And I would take up duties at a hospital.	1																					
47	47		301								Liv	...Perhaps that's how things were supposed to go.	1																					
48	48		301								Liv	But you insisted that... Gray Raven must stick together even if we would have different tasks to do.	1																					
49	49		301								Liv	So, after we went through the first few unforgiving years, we got back together.	1																					
50	50		301								Liv	But there is a price to be paid. We have to relocate according to how the rebuilding process is going. And each time we will be assigned different duties.	1																					
51	51		302								Relocate to where?	52																						
52	52		301								Liv	To another place that still needs to be rebuilt.	1																					
53	53		302								After all, our job is to help people rebuild...	54																						
54	54		302								I guess that's just how things are.	55																						
55	55		204							1	1																							
56	56		301								Liv	Actually, I don't feel bad about that. Quite the contrary, it makes me happy.	1																					
57	57		302								You like relocating?	58																						
58	58		301								Liv	No, that's not it... I just like it when I see a city or a town rebuilt and restored.	1																					
59	59		202							1					1																			
60	60		301									The girl holds out her hands and makes a gesture that looks like a picture frame.																						
61	61		201							1	1031001	1																						
62	62		301							1	Liv	I like it when ruins are restored to buildings and a no man's land turns into a bustling place.	1																					
63	63		301								Liv	I hope we can help people rebuild more places...	1																					
64	64		302								What if one day all the rebuilding is done?	65																						
65	65		301								Liv	I'm sure some people will need my help even when that day comes.	1																					
66	66		302								What do you want to do, Liv, except helping people?																							
67	67		204							1	3																							
68	68		301								Liv	Me...?	1																					
69	69		302								Yes, not what others want, but what you want.	70																						
70	70		301								Liv	...What I want...	1																					
71	71		301								Liv	...	1																					
72	72		204							1	1																							
73	73		301								Liv	I already have what I want.	1																					
74	74		302								Is that so?	75																						
75	75		301								Liv	You and Gray Raven have made me feel belonged.	1																					
76	76		301								Liv	And together, we welcomed peace in our time.	1																					
77	77		301								Liv	I'm very happy to live in a world without the threat of the Punishing Virus. I can't ask for more. This is exactly what I want.	1																					
78	78		301									She looks determined, her eyes as clear as shiny gems.																						
79	79		301								Liv	So long as we can maintain this peace, I'll be happy.	1																					
80	80		302								That's good.	81	That makes two of us.	81																				
81	81		301								Liv	Well... I hope my wish isn't too much to ask from you and the others.	1																					
82	82		401							2	1501																							
83	83		301									Suddenly, a gardener robot in the distance starts sounding its alarm.																						
84	84		204							1	7																							
85	85		301								Liv	...!	1																					
86	86		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				We should check it out.	87																						
87	87		202							1					1																			
88	88		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You run to the gardener robot and realize there is a wounded white bird lying in a hole where a seedling was supposed to be planted.																						
89	89		301									Its wings are injured. Upon seeing people, the bird gets scared and starts struggling.																						
90	90		301									Without saying a word, Liv gently holds up the bird and quickly examines it.																						
91	91		201							1	1031001	19																						
92	92		301							1	Liv	Its wings are broken.	1																					
93	93		302								And it has a ring on its foot.	94																						
94	94		301								Liv	Well, yes... I believe this bird belongs to someone. A domestic bird can't survive in the wild.	1																					
95	95		301								Liv	May I try and heal it?	1																					
96	96		302								Of course.	97																						
97	97		301								Liv	Okay. I'm going to use the infirmary.	1																					
98	98		302								I'm coming with you.	99	I'll stay here to get the job done.	103																				
99	99		204							1																								
100	100		301								Liv	But we still have work to do here...	1																					
101	101		302								It's almost done anyway.	102	We can leave it to the gardener robots.	102																				
102	102	105	301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	Well... Okay, then.	1																					
103	103		204							1																								
104	104		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	Alright. I'll be right back.	1

106	106		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory203.png																								
107	107		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						It is already nighttime when it is time to leave the infirmary.																						
108	108		301									Friends and colleagues who have finished their work are returning from their posts and gathering at the entrance of the amusement park.																						
109	109		201							1	1031001																							
110	110		301							1	Liv	The broadcast operator told me she would help us get the word out. When the bird's owner hears it, they will contact us.	1																					
111	111		204							1	19																							
112	112		301								Liv	But she also told me not to get my hopes up because there have been people releasing domestic birds. They mean well, but there are consequences of what they do.	1																					
113	113		301									Saddened, Liv looks at the bird resting in the box.																						
114	114		302								Shall we keep it for now?	115																						
115	115		204							1	7																							
116	116		301								Liv	Can we do that?	1																					
117	117		302								Of course.	118																						
118	118		204							1	1																							
119	119		301								Liv	Thanks...!	1																					
120	120		202							1					1																			
121	121		301									She happily nods at you and gently puts the box on the floor, fearing her movement will startle the bird.																						
122	122		201							1	1031001	1																						
123	123		301							1	Liv	Where are Lucia and Lee?	1																					
124	124		302								They're on their way here.	125																						
125	125		301									She looks into your eyes and nods again.																						
126	126		204							1																								
127	127		301								Liv	But...	1																					
128	128		302								What's troubling you?	129																						
129	129		301								Liv	...You didn't get much chance to relax today either...	1																					
130	130		302								I'm fine.	131																						
131	131		204							1	19																							
132	132		301								Liv	...	1																					
133	133		301									She doesn't buy that.																						
134	134		302								Is there something you are not telling me?	135																						
135	135		301								Liv	Well... Nothing gets past you... 【kuroname】.	1																					
136	136		302								Tell me, then.	137																						
137	137		301								Liv	...Actually, I... I also think it's too good to be true, so I am worried that...	1																					
138	138		301								Liv	Is the disaster really over? Am I really... not in a dream anymore?	1																					
139	139		302								...	140																						
140	140		301									When you woke up from the long-lasting nightmare, you too felt like everything was too good to be true.																						
141	141		301									All this peace and happiness feel so good that they are like bubbles in a dream.																						
142	142		301									And so you can't help but think...																						
143	143		301								Liv	I'm afraid those bubbles will pop and the dream will be shattered in the very next moment.	1																					
144	144		301									You cannot deny that theory. And you are struggling to find words to calm her because you too had the same doubt before.																						
145	145		301								Liv	...【kuroname】, do you think we will...	1																					
146	146		202							1					1																			
147	147		401							2	10007502																							
148	148		301			RImgBg1Shake						Before she can finish her sentence, blinding light suddenly appears nearby!

150	150		301							1	Liv	Watch out, Commandant!	1																					
151	151		302								Liv!	152																						
152	152		202							1					1																			
153	153		301									You quickly grab Liv by her arm and duck. But to your surprise, she is doing exactly the same thing as you make a move.																						
154	154		301									Hands protecting your heads, the two of you get down and take a defensive stance. However, you don't feel the pain that you were expecting.																						
155	155		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				...	156																						
156	156		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory206.png																								
157	157		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You remove your hands from your heads and look in the direction where the explosion sound came from...																						
158	158		301									You see fireworks lighting up the night sky.																						
159	159		201							1	1031001																							
160	160		301							1	Liv	...	1																					
161	161		302								...	162																						
162	162		301								Liv	...Well, this isn't the first time I see fireworks, but still...	1																					
163	163		302								Perhaps it's because... we weren't expecting there would be fireworks.	164																						
164	164		202							1					1																			
165	165		301									Feeling relieved, the two of you sit on the beach. But the bird in the box doesn't know there are just some fireworks, and now it is struggling to break free in the dark.																						
166	166		302								We are just like this little bird.	167																						
167	167		201							1	1031001																							
168	168		301							1	Liv	A startled bird...?	1																					
169	169		302								...	170																						
170	170		301									Just as what Lucia said, many veteran soldiers have to wrestle with their PTSD for the rest of their lives.																						
171	171		302								But I remember you said that...	172																						
172	172		302								"The nightmare is over."	173																						
173	173		204							1	1																							
174	174		301								Liv	Yeah... The nightmare is over. It's peacetime from now on.	1																					
175	175		302								Liv.	176																						
176	176		301								Liv	Yes. I'm right here.	1																					
177	177		302								There's nothing to worry about anymore.	178	There's... sand on your nose.	179																				
178	178	188	301								Liv	Yeah! With you around, I won't be worried anymore.	1																					
179	179		204							1	7																							
180	180		301								Liv	Huh?	1																					
181	181		202							1					1																			
182	182		301									Feeling nervous, she wipes her face with her hands, but there's sand all over her sleeves and hands, so she ends up making a bigger mess.																						
183	183		302								Let me help you.																							
184	184		201							1	1031001	6																						
185	185		301							1	Liv	Well... Okay.	1																					
186	186		202							1					1																			
187	187	189	301									The girl puts down her hands and gets closer to you so you can help her wipe away the sand and dust on her face.

198	198		202							1																								
199	199		301									As the others leave, you look up into the night sky one last time to enjoy the fireworks and embrace this peaceful moment. It feels more realistic this time.
