8	8		301									Seeing the latitude change by the minute, you can't help but feel slightly unsettled.																						
9	9		301									As a commandant of the Task Force, you wouldn't say you're the most experienced of them all, but you take pride in being a true globetrotter.																						
10	10		301									Still, where you're headed probably remains unchartered territory even to Babylonia's most experienced of generals.																						
11	11		301									When the transport craft has crossed the line that Claudius Ptolemaeus has drawn, you know that you've entered the region on the planet least visited by humans.																						
12	12		301									Antarctica—																						
13	13		301									The last continent humans discovered, a pure white land of snow and ice.																						
14	14		301									By the end of the Golden Age—which marked the pinnacle of human civilization—humans still hadn't yet uncovered all the secrets this continent harbored. When the Punishing Virus hit, this land—located all the way at the southernmost tip of the world—was pushed as far away as possible.																						
15	15		301									And you just never thought you'd ever have a chance to come to Antarctica and see what the place is like.																						
16	16		301									Until...

21	21		301							1	Bianca	Commandant, what's the matter?	1																					
22	22		301									Noticing that you seem to be deep in thought, the blonde Construct next to you turns to speak to you.																						
23	23		202							1					1																			
24	24		301									There is not a single mirror in the transport craft's cabin for you to see your own face at the moment.																						
25	25		301									You do feel a little different from usual, and it probably has something to do with the fact it's Bianca that you're on the mission with.																						
26	26		301									You don't feel edgy, though—in fact, you actually feel excited about where you're headed.																						
27	27		201							1	500533	5																						
28	28		301							1		Adjusting your breathing, you turn around to look at Bianca.																						
29	29		301									She still has the same awe-inspiring air about her as always, but you can tell that she's genuinely concerned about you.																						
30	30		302								I'm fine, Bianca.	31																						
31	31		301				DialogDisable				Bianca	Let me right away know if anything bothers you physically so we can take care of you with what we have here in the transport craft while we still can.	1																					
32	32		302								I'm fine. I was just going through the mission in my head.	33																						
33	33		302								Do you mind walking me through the mission again very quickly, Bianca?	34																						
34	34		204							1	1																							
35	35		301			DialogEnable					Bianca	Of course, Commandant.	1																					
36	36		401							2	897																							
37	37		301									Bianca nods and calls up the holographic screen from her portal-projecting terminal.																						
38	38		204							1																								
39	39		301								Bianca	Seven days ago, Babylonia's WGAA received a mysterious communication from the ground.	1																					
40	40		301								Bianca	And at about exactly the same time, one of WGAA's Archaeological Teams—which apparently enjoys a very special status—stationed in Antarctica fell out of communication with Babylonia.	1																					
41	41		301								Bianca	For the time being, they believe that an unknown harmonic is responsible for the incident.	1																					
42	42		301								Bianca	And combining the incident with the message from the call, the Parliament believes that the polar expedition sending the message is likely to have either defected or gone missing.	1																					
43	43		301								Bianca	Given that Babylonia doesn't have a search team permanently stationed in Antarctica, they decided to put the Purifying Force on the investigation mission for efficiency's sake.	1																					
44	44		301								Bianca	That's the mission in a nutshell. The command center also provided us with a list of the people on the expedition along with their backgrounds. Should I go over them for you, too?	1																					
45	45		302								That's fine. I can do that myself.	46																						
46	46		301									Bianca's calm yet gentle voice soothes you and puts your mind at ease.																						
47	47		202							1					1																			
48	48		301									Receiving the terminal from Bianca, you start going over the details about the mission.																						
49	49		301									You've never seen any of the names or faces on the screen.																						
50	50		301									Which makes perfect sense, though—because you weren't even aware of the existence of the expedition until you were put on the mission.																						
51	51		301									The majority of the continent remains free of the Punishing Virus because human civilization hasn't yet reached that far.																						
52	52		301									While Antarctica often comes across as a barren land, it is, in fact, anything but—in addition to the abundance of petroleum and minerals it hoards, the amount of krill and freshwater reserve from there have over the years been helping Babylonia thrive.																						
53	53		301									Save for the extreme climate in the region, Antarctica makes for a good candidate as a base from which humanity can fight the Punishing Virus.																						
54	54		301									Which is precisely why the Parliament takes the incident as seriously as it does, to the extent that they decided to put Bianca—the Purifying Force's captain—on the mission.																						
55	55		301									There is, however, something you don't quite get...																						
56	56		302								Why am I put on this mission, though?	57																						
57	57		201							1	500533	8																						
58	58		301							1	Bianca	It is true that they rarely put a commandant on a mission along with the Purifying Force...	1																					
59	59		204							1																								
60	60		301								Bianca	Except, as far as this particular mission goes, they think your unique ability to act according to the situation will come in handy in terms of helping us look into the situation, since they haven't really judged the expedition as a target to "purify."	1																					
61	61		301								Bianca	And even if we come across a fight we can't avoid, I'm 100% confident that I'll be able to keep you safe in this new frame, Commandant, since most of the Constructs on the expedition aren't made to fight.	1																					
62	62		301								Bianca	But what makes you more qualified for this role than anyone else, Commandant, is all the experience you have under your belt from the ARU incident.	1																					
63	63		301									Stopping for a second, Bianca adds a last sentence.																						
64	64		204							1	8																							
65	65		301								Bianca	Altogether, I believe these are reasons enough for the command center to approve my request for assistance.	1																					
66	66		204							1																								
67	67		302								...?	68																						
68	68		302								Seems like there is more to it than meets the eye here...	69	C'mon, Bianca. Just tell me why already...	69																				
69	69		204							1	8																							
70	70		301								Bianca	...	1																					
71	71		301									Hearing what you said, Bianca closes her eyes and falls silent for a few moments.																						
72	72		204							1																								
73	73		301								Bianca	And you'd be right... There is more to it than meets the eye here, indeed. There are personal considerations to my decision, too.	1																					
74	74		302								Personal considerations?	75																						
75	75		204							1	8																							
76	76		301								Bianca	...	1																					
77	77		301									Your question incurs further silence.																						
78	78		204							1																								
79	79		301								Bianca	...If this bothers you so much, Commandant, I'll try my best to explain my reasoning to you.	1																					
80	80		301									Bianca speaks in the same tone she did when she was walking you through the mission, but you know Bianca means what she said just now.																						
81	81		302								Don't worry. You can do that whenever you're ready to.	82	I'm all ears, though, if you don't mind.	84																				
82	82		301									Curiosity almost got the best of you, but you decided to respect Bianca's decision.																						
83	83	92	301									You don't think you should force her to speak when she doesn't want to.																						
84	84		301									While Bianca doesn't exactly seem like she wants to talk at the moment, you decide to press on.																						
85	85		301									You want to find out why she decided to work with you, considering that you'll be going through the rest of the mission together.																						
86	86		204							1	8																							
87	87		301								Bianca	Uhm...	1																					
88	88		301								Bianca	Please allow me a few moments to organize my thoughts.	1																					
89	89		301									Closing her eyes, Bianca starts forming a response with a frown on her face.																						
90	90		302								We can totally do this at a different time if you need time to think it through.	91																						
91	91		301									It doesn't seem like a good idea to press on, and you think you should just give her the benefit of the doubt.																						
92	92		301									Bianca isn't just some random Construct—you've stared death countless times in the eye with her to know that she's someone you can trust unconditionally.																						
93	93		204							1	1																							
94	94		301								Bianca	Thank you, Commandant.	1																					
95	95		301								Bianca	Let's just do this at a different time, then... And I'm sure it'll happen in no time.	1																					
96	96		302								Of course. I'll be all ears when you're ready.	97																						
97	97		301									Seeing her smile, you know that you've made the right choice.																						
98	98		204							1	4																							
99	99		301								Bianca	Hmm, seems like I've made the right choice there.	1																					
100	100		204							1	1																							
101	101		301								Bianca	Now, at the risk of sounding extremely unappreciative...	1																					
102	102		204							1	8																							
103	103		301								Bianca	I really thought we were off to a good start with you around, but...	1																					
104	104		204							1																								
105	105		301									Bianca turns around to look out the thick window over on the other side.																						
106	106		301									The dark drapes that are the skies hang right outside the window, beyond which a tsunami of snowflakes is lashing mercilessly on the tempered glass.																						
107	107		301									The winds deal one heavy blow after another on the fuselage. You now see what's responsible for the jolts you've been feeling from time to time now.																						
108	108		204							1	5																							
109	109		301								Bianca	Look at that. Seems like we're in for a surprise, huh...	1																					
110	110		301									You learned about Antarctica's extreme, ever-changing weather back in Military Geography at F.O.S.																						
111	111		301									You never understood why a section of the course was dedicated to addressing Antarctica, given how low the density of the Punishing Virus is in the region. Looking back now, you see you couldn't be more wrong.																						
112	112		302								And I suppose there is no turning back, no?	113																						
113	113		301								Bianca	Correct. A mission assigned to the Purifying Force cannot be revoked unless force majeure is encountered.	1																					
114	114		301								Bianca	But given the weather, it's impossible for us to land where we originally planned to.	1																					
115	115		302								We need to do a forced landing here.	116																						
116	116		302								We're counting on ourselves for the rest of the way.	117																						
117	117		301									As you speak, you point at the polar vehicle that came with the transport craft. Bianca nods in agreement.																						
118	118		204							1																								
119	119		301								Bianca	Understood. Our first task will be to reach the nearest research station, then.	1																					
120	120		301									Shaky, the transport craft slowly touches down on an icy surface.																						
121	121		301									The safety buckle unlocks. You stand up for some long-overdue stretch.																						
122	122		301									After ensuring that nothing is out of the ordinary with her frame, Bianca saunters over with her hand on the longsword by her waist.																						
123	123		301								Bianca	This is definitely a lot worse than I imagined...	1																					
124	124		301								Bianca	I can send in a withdrawal request for you and have the transport craft take you back to Babylonia, Commandant, if you deem the situation to be overly risky.	1																					
125	125		302								Think I can't catch up to you, huh?	126																						
126	126		204							1	7																							
127	127		301								Bianca	No, I'm just...	1																					
128	128		302								You hand-picked me yourself, Bianca.	129																						
129	129		301									Your words catch Bianca by surprise.																						
130	130		204							1	2																							
131	131		301									She lowers her head—and when she raises her head to look at you again, she has a confident smile on her face.																						
132	132		204							1	4																							
133	133		301								Bianca	Of course, Commandant. Apologies for the faux pas just now.	1																					
134	134		204							1	2																							
135	135		301								Bianca	Considering what you and I have been through together, this snow is hardly worth mentioning.	1																					
136	136		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Bianca	Let's go, Commandant.	1

143	143		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						With her reassuring words, the cabin's door clicks open.																						
144	144		301									With the bone-chilling wind comes the ice shards that cut at you like invisible daggers.																						
145	145		301									To your surprise, however, you feel no pain, nor do you feel the subzero cold in the air.																						
146	146		301									You look at Bianca as her golden hair dances around her slim body to the icy wind.																						
147	147		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					This land of permafrost is one of the Earth's final destinations, and you're now taking your very first step on it.
