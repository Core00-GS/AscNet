6	6		301									Lucia's last strike has hit the exposed Hetero-Core. The Polyphage lets out a screeching, distorted scream, its attacks clearly slowing down.

9	9		202							1					1																			
10	10		301									The Polyphage bellows in an odd and twisted way, and you can see the damaged parts of the Hetero-Core repairing itself.																						
11	11		201							1	1031001																							
12	12		301							1	Liv	If we don't destroy its entirety, is it just going to keep fixing itself...? We might not be able to stop it the way we stopped the Rail Heterozygote.	1																					
13	13		201							1	500166																							
14	14		301							1	Lucia	If we don't wipe it out completely, it'll keep repairing itself indefinitely.	1

17	17		301							1	Lee	Despite both being the products of the Hetero-Core, there is one difference between the Polyphage and the Rail Heterozygote.	1																					
18	18		302								Luna.	19	An Ascendant in its center.	19																				
19	19		301								Liv	That's right. Luna may be the source of the Polyphage's power and self-repairing ability. Gabriel did say she was "the most important piece of the puzzle..."	2																					
20	20		301								Lee	It seems that... the only way to defeat the Polyphage is to incapacitate this puzzle piece.	1

23	23		301							1	Lucia	So it is.	1																					
24	24		301									Everyone there understands the weight of her words. Lucia clutches her sword as everyone else falls silent.																						
25	25		301								Lucia	Commandant... If I may.	1																					
26	26		302								Please.	27																						
27	27		301								Lucia	I am a Construct, a human's blade to reclaim Earth. The Ascendants are our enemies.	1																					
28	28		301								Lucia	If I try to help Luna, I'll be helping an enemy.	1																					
29	29		301								Lucia	And yet...	1																					
30	30		301									Lucia takes a deep breath, and puts her right hand in front of her chest, as though she is attesting to her decision.																						
31	31		301								Lucia	Even if it's baseless... Even if it sounds ridiculous, even to me—I want to believe her.	1																					
32	32		301								Lucia	I want to believe that deep down... she is still the Luna who's afraid to be alone, who is waiting for someone to hold her hand.	1																					
33	33		301								Lucia	After remembering my past, I've been wondering that, had I held onto my sister's hand a little tighter, had I been a little bit more decisive, a little bit braver, maybe things would turn out differently.	1																					
34	34		301								Lucia	But I can't change my past. I can only move forward.	1																					
35	35		301								Lucia	Move forward, and find a way to end this war, to save all of us, even when we're on opposite sides—to find that impossible answer.	1																					
36	36		301								Lucia	Will you still support me, Commandant... when I won't stop believing?	1																					
37	37		302							9550	I will.	40	I told you I'll respect your decisions.	42

40	40		301								Lucia	Thank you, Commandant... for believing the capricious me.	1																					
41	41	45	301									Lucia slightly relaxes her grip. She breathes a sigh of relief before raising her head and gazing, on her face a familiar look of determination.																						
42	42		301								Lucia	...Thank you, Commandant.	1																					
43	43		301								Lucia	It... really is a very naive thought. I'm sorry that all of you have to indulge me all this way.	1																					
44	44		301									Lucia's expression is familiar—the smile she has forced herself to wear since one bygone day.																						
45	45		204							1																								
46	46		301								Lucia	I... fear that my choice will put you all in danger, so I want you to leave first, please.	1																					
47	47		301								Lucia	I want to see Luna again and ask her so many questions... I want to find out with my own eyes if she is still the Luna I remember.	1																					
48	48		301								Lucia	If she isn't, I am prepared to strike her down. I will not let anyone get hurt because of her again.	1																					
49	49		301								Lucia	But if it is between taking her down or saving her...	1																					
50	50		301								Lucia	I... still want to save her.	1																					
51	51		201							1	500026																							
52	52		301							1	Lee	If we can get to the top of the Polyphage and try to separate Luna from it, we might be able to greatly weaken it, to the point where it can be destroyed.	1																					
53	53		301								Lee	...The way I see it, this has never been a path of pure destruction.	1

58	58		301							1	Lee	If it were me, I would also want to believe in my family.	1																					
59	59		301								Lee	We might have become Constructs, but to me, our bonds don't change just because our bodies do.	1																					
60	60		301								Lee	It's as good as any reason to fight.	1																					
61	61		301								Lee	Whether speaking as a Gray Raven, or just speaking for myself... I'll support you.	1																					
62	62		204							2	1																							
63	63		301								Liv	I've always believed in you, Lucia.	2																					
64	64		301								Liv	Because you are strong, and you are kind.	2

69	69		301							1	Liv	If Gabriel wasn't lying about the Polyphage fusing with Luna... then it'll be too late when it completely devours her.	1																					
70	70		301								Liv	Stopping it is all we can do right now.	1																					
71	71		204							1	1																							
72	72		301								Liv	So, Lucia, please don't carry this burden by yourself. Whatever trouble is ahead, we will face it together.	1																					
73	73		202							1					1																			
74	74		301									Lucia nods at Liv, as you all stand side by side.

79	79		301								Liv	I have everyone's back... and you have my support!	3																					
80	80		301								Lee	Let's get ready and board the Polyphage. Try to approach where Luna is.	2																					
81	81		204							1	5																							
82	82		301								Lucia	We'll be exposed to the enemies' attacks if we get any closer. Commandant, at your orders!	1																					
83	83		302								Charge!	84	Our target is the Energy Core at the top of the Polyphage.	84
