3	3		301			DialogEnable						After leaving the capital, the players followed the hand-drawn map in the Heroes' Journal and reached an area they had never been to.																						
4	4		301									Lee opens the Heroes' Journal. Although it is largely unorganized, the information about "Flawless Rope" has been thoughtfully put together.																						
5	5		201							1	500026																							
6	6		301								Lee	What the journal says about the rope is... The Overlord of the Unbounded Realm, Leader of the Wings, who established utopia in a land where no gods could see...	1

8	8		301							1	Kamui	Why does this sound like the description of the final boss? What is Ayla trying to tell us...?	1

10	10		301							1	Lee	The nameless and crownless are deemed to lose themselves in the storm.	1

12	12		301							1	Chrome	Nameless and crownless... Do we need to collect something?	1																					
13	13		201							1	1081001																							
14	14		301							1	Kamui	I think the "name" and "crown" here refer to titles, and they have to be of the highest rank.	1																					
15	15		201							1	500273																							
16	16		301							1	Wanshi	Lose themselves in the storm... I haven't detected any related weather conditions. Perhaps it's just telling us without a proper title, we will be significantly disadvantaged in this battle.	1

18	18		301							1	Kamui	Ta-da!	1																					
19	19		301									Kamui points to the top of his head with a big smile. He already had some text there back when everyone was still in the capital.

23	23		301							1	Kamui	I was saving it for negotiation. Never thought it would be useful here.	1																					
24	24		204							1																								
25	25		301								Kamui	Now I have the highest title of the Church of Flying Ramen, you only need to become my believers. This effect should be able to cover all of you.	1

55	55		301								Celica	I wanted to join as a hero, but Ayla said "Overlord Celica" was way too powerful and must not be put in the hero team.	1																					
56	56		201							1	1081001																							
57	57		301							1	Kamui	Let me take a look. Open the system panel and check the character attributes of "Overlord Celica"...	1																					
58	58		301								Kamui	Hmm... It shows "maximum" in every single attribute. Ayla probably wanted to give the boss more protection.	1																					
59	59		301								Kamui	I mean, you can't have characters with higher attributes than the boss in the beginner's spawn point.	1																					
60	60		201							1	500001																							
61	61		301							1	Celica	Shouldn't heroes be so powerful in the first place?	1

64	64		201							1	500001																							
65	65		301							1	Celica	Anyway, I can only be the Boss here.	1																					
66	66		301									Celica winks, and all players see "Overlord Celica" written in a glamorous font in their vision.

68	68		301							1	Kamui	Show your health bar then. Let's enjoy this battle... Speaking of which, Celica, aren't you going to draw your weapon?	1
