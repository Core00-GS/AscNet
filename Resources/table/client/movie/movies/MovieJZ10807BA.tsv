6	6		301							1	Bruce	Watanabe! This is the prize for coming in first in the squad rankings! Instructor said to open it together with you.	1																					
7	7		301								Watanabe	Why so mysterious... Hm...? A combat knife?	2																					
8	8		301								Watanabe	Can't the instructor be more creative? A Gurkha knife... Well, at least it's a good knife. So who came in first? You or me?	2																					
9	9		301								Bruce	Both of us. But there's only this one prize.	1																					
10	10		301								Watanabe	Whatever, I don't need a new knife anyway. I'll just leave it to people like you who wish to die on the front lines every day.	2																					
11	11		301								Bruce	Thanks then. If anything does happen to me one day... Well, take care of it then.	1

22	22		301									Bruce's hand wraps tightly around the combat knife, the cold causing his lifeless hand to freeze in place. It was impossible to peel the knife out of his firm grip.

24	24		301									Watanabe stands silently. After a while, he crouches down, his comrade's hand in one hand, and the blade of the knife in the other. He carefully extracts the knife, bandages it, and adds it to his gear.
