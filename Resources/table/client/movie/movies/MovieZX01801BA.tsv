183	179		301								Asimov	The Red Tide initially lurked in an underground cavern that was designed as nuclear fallout shelter by City 075. It circulated through the city's underground waterways before reaching critical mass and emerging onto the surface.

189	184		301								Asimov	Plus, the underground cavern was built in secret, so many places are in our blind spots. Some underground waterways connect to nearby rivers through an intricate network of pipelines. Even if the rivers have dried up, the riverbeds and ravines are still there.	1																					
190	185		301								Asimov	A portion of the Red Tide was able to slip out of the city undetected through these blind spots.	1																					
191	186		301								Asimov	Moreover, as you just saw on the screen, the Red Tide has formed tributaries along the surface of the wasteland.	1																					
192	187		301								Asimov	After receiving this information from our scouts on the surface, the Science Council has conducted emergency tests on this form of the Red Tide.	1

203	198		301								Asimov	If we allow the Red Tide to reach the shoreline, there's no turning back.	1																					
204	199		301								Asimov	Unlike the ocean, land serves as an inorganic buffer zone that can block the Red Tide. There is no better medium for the wanton proliferation and spread of Red Tide than water.	1																					
205	200		301								Asimov	The whole sea will become corrupted, devoured and assimilated by the Red Tide.	1																					
206	201		301								Asimov	By that time, the Punishing Virus will spread to every corner of the world.	1																					
207	202		301								Asimov	In order to curb the spread of the Red Tide, Babylonia has formulated a plan to bombard the Red Tide with the Longinus Arsenal, referencing the plan made during the battle at the space station.	1																					
208	203		301								Asimov	The first step of this plan is to obtain the exact coordinates and location of the Red Tide.	1

226	221		301								Hassen	Your task is to locate the edge of the Red Tide, insert the bit domain node, activate it, then protect it until you receive the evacuation order from Babylonia.	2																					
227	222		301								Hassen	The total coverage must include all of the Red Tide tributaries. We need to remove it all at once to ensure that no residual tide is left this time.	2																					
228	223		301								Hassen	If you are attacked by Hetero-Creatures during this period, hold your position to ensure the integrity and security of the bit domain node.	2																					
229	224		301								Hassen	In order to ensure that this operation goes according to plan, we will saturate our deployments, positionings, and attacks.	2																					
230	225		301								Hassen	Eight teams will be deployed to execute this calibration mission. Each team is composed of an elite task force led by a commandant and several Construct squads.	2																					
231	226		301								Hassen	The elite task force led by the commandant will be responsible for deploying the node, while the Construct teams will be responsible for protecting them in the interim.	2																					
232	227		301								Hassen	Hopefully, all eight bit domain nodes will be deployed—that's the only ideal situation.	2																					
233	228		301								Hassen	However, Babylonia needs at least three bit domain nodes to be successfully deployed in order to obtain accurate enough coordinates.	2																					
234	229		301								Hassen	If you have any questions, please raise them now, and Asimov will explain the details to you.	2																					
235	230		302								What is a bit domain node?	231	No questions.	242

238	233		301							1	Asimov	Hmm... Where to start?	1																					
239	234		301								Asimov	It's not overly technical. It's a rush job used to temporarily replace satellites.	1																					
240	235		301								Asimov	The satnav system continuously broadcasts its current coordinates and time.	1																					
241	236		301								Asimov	However, thanks to the Punishing Virus, there are no navigation satellites available in low Earth orbit, so we have to use bit domain nodes instead.	1																					
242	237		301								Asimov	When they're deployed on the surface, they will measure the distance and angle between the other nodes, then continuously broadcast a signal to space.	1																					
243	238		301								Asimov	After receiving the signal, Babylonia will calculate the specific coordinates of each node, then delineate the attack range for the Longinus Arsenal.	1																					
244	239		301								Asimov	Babylonia will inform you after successfully receiving the signal and calculating the coordinates. Until then, you can't retreat.	1																					
245	240		301								Asimov	It should be noted that the current orbital altitude of Babylonia allows us to orbit Earth in about two hours. The signal from the nodes will only be received when passing through the airspace within the range of the nodes.	1																					
246	241		301								Asimov	This is also why you need to defend the nodes upon activation.	1

249	244		301							1	Asimov	Are there any other questions?	1																					
250	245		301								Asimov	Alright, there's just one more thing I'd like to add.	1																					
251	246		301								Asimov	Unlike when the Red Tide was found in City 075, the consistency... is more like running water than thick mud this time. We aren't sure why.	1																					
252	247		301								Asimov	Regardless, all you need to know is that the "concentration" and "volatility" of the Red Tide are significantly less than what it was before.	1																					
253	248		301								Asimov	Only when the tide "rises" will the Punishing Virus concentration reach the equivalent found in Dead Zones.	1																					
254	249		301								Asimov	According to monitoring reports, low tide concentration is within the range of normal Punishing zones.	1																					
255	250		301								Asimov	This is one of the reasons why the recon team failed to notice that the Red Tide had moved.	1																					
256	251		301								Asimov	Thankfully, however, this means that the protective devices enhanced by the Science Council on such short notice are sufficient for working in proximity to the Red Tide for the duration of the mission.	1																					
257	252		301								Asimov	However, it's for only a short duration. Avoid close contact with the Red Tide after landing, especially during high tide.	1																					
258	253		201							1	500011																							
259	254		301							1	Hassen	That should suffice.	1																					
260	255		301								Hassen	Seems like everyone fully understands the mission and the gravity of our dilemma.	1																					
261	256		301								Hassen	This presents an important opportunity for Babylonia to launch an attack. However, we need to change orbit and reduce altitude to commence the attack, which puts us at risk of intersecting the network of corrupted satellites. As such, our anti-air defenses won't allow us to remain in position for very long.	1																					
262	257		301								Hassen	Similarly, your mission is not to annihilate Hetero-Creatures, but to deploy the bit domain nodes.	1																					
263	258		301								Hassen	The nodes aren't particularly difficult to deploy, but in a strategic sense, this mission is crucial. It requires a high degree of collaboration and team awareness from all of you.	1																					
264	259		301								Hassen	Avoid head-on confrontations and needless acts of heroism that do not otherwise serve the success of the mission. Our top priority is to protect the nodes until Babylonia receives the coordinate data.	1																					
265	260		301								Hassen	I know that the commandants of the task forces present are among the most elite. I do not question your ability. However, this operation needs neither personal heroism nor combat ability.	1																					
266	261		301								Hassen	What matters most are judgment and decision-making for the overall benefit of the mission.	1																					
267	262		301								Hassen	Most of you are used to fighting solely with your own team. So for this operation only, I have specifically arranged Hans to act as the chief commander for the calibration operation at ground level.	1

273	268		301									Some of the team captains present show faint expressions of confusion on how an elderly man, seemingly a few years older than even Hassen, is serving as the chief commander for such an important mission.																						
274	269		301								Hassen	For safety reasons, only the commandant of each task force has the authority to deploy their bit domain node.	1																					
275	270		301								Hassen	Please make accurate judgments and verify with Chief Commander Hans before activating your bit domain node to ensure that Babylonia receives the most accurate coordinates.	1																					
276	271		301								Hassen	The rise and fall of the Red Tide will greatly affect the real-time topographic changes within the combat zone. There may have already been significant changes within the duration of this meeting.	1
