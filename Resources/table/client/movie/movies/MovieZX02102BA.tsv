12	12		301								Vera	It called itself "Voodoo", and it kept mumbling about a guy named Vonnegut. It first attacked the Ascendant Roland before coming after us.	1																					
13	13		301								Vera	That's all I got. Ask me however you want, but that's all I can tell you... What else are you expecting? A lecture on its behavior pattern? How the hell would I know what the Punishing Virus has done to it?	1																					
14	14		301								Kurono Construct	Based on the mission logs, you had disengaged the remote connection for a time not long after the mission began.	2																					
15	15		301								Kurono Construct	Your tracks deviated from your planned route quite extensively afterward.	2																					
16	16		301								Vera	Hah.	1

24	24		201							1	500168	1																						
25	25		301							1	Vera	Cerberus accepted your assignment due to the Chief Commander's order, but that window closes when the mission ends.	1																					
26	26		301								Vera	Now that you've terminated our mission—our mission has ended, so you have no authority over us anymore, given the terms of our arrangement. We don't even have to sit here and get grilled by you.	1																					
27	27		301								Vera	Understand this—we're staying here listening to your macho crap because we're in a "good mood," not because we're afraid. I know your type, so don't think for a second that your scare tactics will work on us.	1

29	29		301									The hostility in her voice has all the Kurono soldiers raise their weapons.																						
30	30		301									The red-haired Construct stands amidst them proudly like a rose above its thorns. She has shown no signs of aggression; her fingertips have not even moved an inch toward the hilt by her waist.																						
31	31		301									Still, the threat she poses just standing there can nonetheless make one shiver with fear.																						
32	32		301								Kurono Construct	The redheaded Death...																						
33	33		301									Someone whispers.																						
34	34		301									Vera tilts her head toward whoever muttered her old nickname. She grins from ear to ear, almost in a teasing way.

36	36		301							1	Vera	Ha! I haven't heard that name in a very long time. How "nostalgic"...	1																					
37	37		301									Vera raises her hand, and all the soldiers hold their breaths just from this one simple motion.																						
38	38		301									Everyone is expecting her to draw her sword, but she does not. Instead, she slides a finger across her neck in front of the soldiers tauntingly.																						
39	39		301								Vera	Do you want me to cut you down?	1																					
40	40		301									Her tone is cold, unlike her expression.																						
41	41		301									The Kurono Constructs interrogating her take a look at each other.

50	50		301								Kurono Construct	We'll need to quarantine her in isolation and inspect her frame. Before we can confirm she is stable, we cannot end our observation in case something goes wrong.	2																					
51	51		301								Kurono Construct	Given that all three of you have come into contact with a new enemy type, we cannot eliminate the possibility that you are all potential risks.	2

63	63		301									No one can react in time. The female Construct is so fast that no one caught the moment she drew her blade. Despite being a Support-type Construct, her movement is as swift as an Attacker.																						
64	64		301									By the time vital fluid drips down the soldier's cheek to his shoulder, the Kurono Constructs around Vera aim their guns at her as if they have just been snapped awake.																						
65	65		301									With their fingers on the triggers, they are prepared to fire.																						
66	66		301									Vera's blade does not shift a bit.																						
67	67		301								Vera	As I've mentioned, don't attempt to treat us the way you treat Gray Raven. No one understands you more than I do—your bogus claims might work on those birdies, but you aren't fooling me. I know what you're planning.	1																					
68	68		301								Kurono Construct	Lower your weapon, BPN-13. I repeat, lower your weapon, BPN-13.	2																					
69	69		301									Unfazed, Vera just stares at him.																						
70	70		301									At the same time, No. 21's beast-like growl can be heard dozens of feet away from them on the other end of the quarantine zone.																						
71	71		301								No. 21	I... want to see my captain.																						
72	72		301								No. 21	Do not... come near me.																						
73	73		401							2	561																							
74	74		301									Her growls spread to Vera's end sporadically. It is then followed by loud clashes and Noctis' yelling immediately afterward.																						
75	75		401							2	561																							
76	76		301								Noctis	Hey! I have no idea what any of your words mean! I said I wanted to see my boss, do you hear me?																						
77	77		301								Noctis	Oh? You're trying to stop me, is that it?																						
78	78		301									It seems that Kurono has given her teammates the same speech.

80	80		301									Vera's furrowed brows relax.																						
81	81		301									Vera turns out to be the "calmest" one of them all—this thought makes her chuckle.

83	83		401							2	1515																							
84	84		204							1																								
85	85		301									A voice in her ear stops her from smiling.

92	92		301									A field not far away from the outskirts of the town.																						
93	93		301									As the captain of the Task Force directly under the Chief Commander, Vera has an encrypted communication channel with Nikola, who owns the only key.																						
94	94		301									Hounds are tools that help the hunter hunt. She needs not ask nor think—her only duty when an objective arrives is to make haste to the destination, retrieve the object, and bring it back to the target location.																						
95	95		301									This is an order only she can hear, coordinates only she can see... a solo mission for Vera and Vera only.																						
96	96		301									She understands immediately.																						
97	97		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She sheaths her blade and makes a circle with her thumb and index finger, placing it next to her lips, and she whistles. The sound penetrates and echoes throughout the quarantine zone.

105	105		202							1					1																			
106	106		301									This is a signal Cerberus rarely uses. Seldom would people on the battlefield use such a loud and obvious signal.																						
107	107		301									In fact, it does not entail any strategy at all. Cerberus never thinks about tactics or plans... this signal of theirs is simply used to issue a simple command—																						
108	108		301									"Sit. Good doggy."																						
109	109		301									Cerberus is often ruthless on the field. Left unchecked, they will kill nonstop, usually resulting in matters getting out of hand.																						
110	110		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					This is why Vera has designed this signal to command them to stop. If anything, it is more akin to a leash that holds back the rabid dogs.																						
111	111		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Noctis also hears her whistle from where he is.

130	130		301									You are smelling the scent of dirt freshly watered.																						
131	131		301									This is not a scent you would smell on Babylonia, a metal-plated fortress.																						
132	132		301									Confused, you suddenly find the Constructs outside the blast-resistant glass raising their weapons.

243	243		301									You have been transported to Earth since your first remote connection.																						
244	244		301									They have replicated the dark room they caged you on this transport craft to create the illusion that you were not moved.																						
245	245		301								Vera	I've taken down most of the Kurono Constructs on my way here, but their reinforcement will arrive soon.	1																					
246	246		301								Vera	Go close the rear door. I've only torn apart this room, not the craft itself.	1																					
247	247		301								Vera	I'm going to fly the plane now. Time to bolt.	1

253	253		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The door to the study opens.																						
254	254		301									All Collins does is raise his eyebrows.																						
255	255		301									Despite his guest arriving unprompted, Collins knows that his address is only known to a selected few, accessible to fewer. He is not worried about his safety. Someone who can arrive safely must be one of his.																						
256	256		301									Indeed. It is Rebecca at his door.																						
257	257		301									Her chest rises and falls from her heavy breaths, her usually elegant appearance slightly unkempt. It is apparent that she was in a hurry and unable to bother with how she looked.																						
258	258		301									This is unusual for Rebecca. Someone like her cares for how she presents herself.																						
259	259		301									Unless things are so dire that she cannot afford to do so.																						
260	260		301									Collins straightens himself while Rebecca has already arrived before him, her high heel shoes clicking.																						
261	261		201							1	500337	4	-400																					
262	262		201							2	500319	7	400																					
263	263		301							1	Rebecca	What was that you got from the Chief Commander? The Gray Raven Commandant just got rescued by the Cerberus captain! Your plan to sneak the commandant away has backfired!	1																					
264	264		301									Collins pauses for a second before he starts laughing.																						
265	265		204							2																								
266	266		301								Collins	Ahahaha... I can't believe it! Nicky actually did it...	2																					
267	267		301									Stupefied, Rebecca stares at the man before her, who laughs so hard he almost runs out of breath, and she stands there, confused.																						
268	268		301								Collins	At least our socialite here has stopped pretending to be neutral.	2																					
269	269		301									Rebecca instantly understands that he is mocking how she has been playing both sides.																						
270	270		301									She takes another deep breath and continues.																						
271	271		301								Rebecca	The only good news is that we have detained the other two Cerberus members. One of them was connected with the commandant for a long period of time, and her M.I.N.D. showed unusual activities during the mission.	1																					
272	272		301								Rebecca	As long as we retrieve her and analyze her M.I.N.D., our mission is not a total failure... Why the hell are you not nervous at all?!	1																					
273	273		301									Collins answers her with a question.																						
274	274		301								Collins	What was the objective of this operation?	2																					
275	275		301									This time, it is Rebecca who pauses.																						
276	276		301									The objective? She ponders. On the surface, it was to utilize the Gray Raven Commandant to investigate what appeared to be Luna's M.I.N.D. activities and locate her.																						
277	277		301									That was what she thought as well, in the beginning.																						
278	278		301									But things apparently are not what they seem. Collins promised to return the Gray Raven Commandant to the Parliament, yet he tried to move the commandant behind their back, meaning he wanted to hold on to this asset.																						
279	279		301									Kurono is not known for leniency. Rebecca even thought that Collins would come up with more ways to counter the Parliament after the mission.																						
280	280		301									The reason he has his eyes on the Gray Raven Commandant is simply that the commandant has the potential to connect to an agent without getting their consciousness corrupted.																						
281	281		301									Of course the Parliament would not believe him, but what is done is done. There is nothing they could do.																						
282	282		301									Having organized her thoughts, Rebecca almost thinks that the whole operation was set up to test and capture the Gray Raven Commandant.																						
283	283		301								Rebecca	We were trying to track down the agent "Luna."	1																					
284	284		301									Having said it out loud, a slight hint of inconsistency rings in the back of her mind.																						
285	285		301									She knows very well that all Collins has cared about is that agent. Everything that has driven him so far is connected to the agent.																						
286	286		301									The reason he has his eyes on the Gray Raven Commandant is simply that the commandant has the potential to connect to an agent without a corrupted consciousness.																						
287	287		301									But she suddenly realizes one thing—																						
288	288		301									She has the priority wrong.																						
289	289		301									As important as that commandant is, Collins still cares about the agent more. But, right now, he is ready to move heaven and earth just to keep the commandant in his grasp...																						
290	290		301									Sure, the more cards they hold in their hand, the better. But if they had to pick one over the other, they would have chosen the agent.																						
291	291		301									And yet, Collins is in no hurry to track down Luna, the agent, even when her M.I.N.D. activity was discovered in that town. All they did was send a squad to the surface to investigate.																						
292	292		301									Almost as if he cares not about finding the agent and instead the commandant's ability to "sniff out" an agent's tracks.																						
293	293		301									That cannot be right—the agent's whereabouts should be the most important thing, unless... Unless—																						
294	294		301									Suddenly, Rebecca connects the dots.																						
295	295		301									She raises her head, frightened, and looks at the smirking Collins. His smile is still comical, but she can see the vileness behind it.																						
296	296		301								Collins	Have you figured it out, our dear socialite?	2																					
297	297		301									She tries to speak, and that is when she discovers her throat is dry from her realization.																						
298	298		301								Collins	I chose to tell you the truth in the past because, personally, I believed you.	2																					
299	299		301								Collins	Well, not that I believed you not to reveal our secrets to the Parliament. I believed that it wouldn't matter even if you did.	2																					
300	300		301									Collins repeats to her their past conversation, word-for-word.																						
301	301		301								Collins	As for the rest, don't think about it. Just keep up your appearance and play your part as the one that dances between Kurono and the Parliament. It'll be beneficial to both of us.	2																					
302	302		301									Rebecca nods tentatively.																						
303	303		301									Collins sighs.																						
304	305		301								Collins	I knew Nicky had something planned. I just wasn't expecting him to burn this bridge of ours to get what he wants.	2																					
305	306		301								Collins	This makes me even more curious. Doing so means they've gotten what they wanted, something so important that they think it's okay to mess with us.	2																					
306	307		301								Collins	What is it, Nicky? Does it have something to do with that intel?	2																					
307	308		301									Collins is mumbling to himself while simultaneously looking like he is talking to Nikola across time and space.																						
308	309		301									Rebecca, finally having her voice back, interrupts him abruptly.																						
309	310		301								Rebecca	Then what is your... our next move?	1																					
310	311		301								Collins	Track the transport craft. Intercept it if we can, let them go if we can't.	2																					
311	312		301								Rebecca	We're just going to let them leave?	1																					
312	313		301								Collins	Say you have the key to a treasure chest but not its location, and out of nowhere, someone shows up with its location but not the key...	2																					
313	315		301								Collins	Why be selfish and hold onto the key?	2																					
314	316		202							1	2				1																			
315	317		301									Collins stands up and straightens the collars of his shirt, preparing to head out.																						
316	318		301									Before he leaves, he looks back at Rebecca.																						
317	319		201							1	500319																							
318	320		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Collins	And when they unlock the treasure chest and bring it back, we'll just... take it. Yeah?	1

323	325		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Celica	Your message is recorded. It'll be delivered alongside the supplies during the routine airdrop.	2																					
324	326		301								Celica	But we don't have a forward operating base there. Dropping supplies at entirely new coordinates could catch "some" people's attention. I've tried to conceal it with other operations as much as possible.	2																					
325	327		301								Hassen	Thank you, Celica.	1																					
326	328		301									Instead of joking about overtime pay like she usually does, Celica just looks tired.																						
327	329		301									Rather, everyone in the conference room looks tired.																						
328	330		301								Hassen	Go rest, Celica.	1																					
329	331		301									Celica opens her mouth, wanting to say she is fine.																						
330	332		202							1	2				1																			
331	333		301									But seeing Hassen's look, she instead says nothing, departing the room quietly, leaving Hassen and Nikola by themselves.

334	336		301							1	Nikola	Transferring Cerberus has caused Murray's suspicion already. He was the one who retrieved the first part of that intel. Knowing him, he must have had a backup made. Aren't you worried that he'd give it to Kurono?	2																					
335	337		301								Hassen	He's a smart kid. He knows what's okay and what isn't.	1																					
336	338		301								Hassen	He won't take risks for something nonbeneficial. He's a merchant, not a dishonorable traitor.	1
