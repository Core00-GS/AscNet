483	483		301									An origami Queen of the Night sits by your pillow, its paper emitting a subtle hint of dirt and blood.																						
484	484		301									You struggle to shut off the alarm on the nightstand, trying to get up, only to find your body incredibly heavy, where every simple action requires a tremendous amount of strength.																						
485	485		301									You look up at the clock projection, and you discover that it has been almost three months since the mission to the Pulia Forest Park Ruins.																						
486	486		302								Almost three months already...	487																						
487	487		301									With great difficulties, you try to adjust to your bedridden body and stand up, moving out of the room one step at a time.

495	495		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After she tells you about what has happened to Liv and the others, you look back at the paper flower by the bed, finally understanding what it means.																						
496	496		302								Please let me return to the field.	497																						
497	497		301								Hippocrates	In this state?	1																					
498	498		302								Yes.	499																						
499	499		301									Even when your body is now a burden, you will lose your only shot if you stay here in defeat.																						
500	500		301									But regrets are not a good reason to be reckless. You have to plan accordingly.																						
501	501		302								I will establish a remote connection first.	502																						
502	502		301									According to the Professor, Lucia, Lee, and Chrome are all back on their feet and able to communicate and connect with you remotely.																						
503	503		302								I'll put on an exoskeleton before heading to the surface.	504																						
504	504		301								Hippocrates	...	1

514	514		301								Hippocrates	I thought something was wrong with you up there with how confident and eager you are, having just woken up.	1																					
515	515		301								Hippocrates	Your mind isn't jumbled, and your body isn't a complete mess from a three-month coma. I guess I wouldn't be able to stop you.	1																					
516	516		302								It hasn't been three months yet...	517	So you smacked me to confirm that?	518																				
517	517	519	301								Hippocrates	More or less.	1																					
518	518		301								Hippocrates	Do you think we have time for a detailed inspection? Being able to stand will suffice. Not that there is any other way.	1																					
519	519		301								Hippocrates	As for your plan, I'll need to find someone else to see if it's feasible. Get changed when I look for them... Can you do that?	1																					
520	520		302								Of course.	521																						
521	521		301								Hippocrates	Good, you look lively. Woke up a bit later than I like, but for someone who suffered a head injury and stayed bedridden for three months, you're looking just fine. How should I phrase it...	1																					
522	522		301									She ponders a bit.																						
523	523		302								I'm lucky.	524	Thanks to modern science and technology.	526	Thanks to the doctors and nurses.	527																		
524	524		301								Hippocrates	You can be the luckiest dead person in the world if not for the doctors and nurses who treated you and the medical technology used to fix you up! Be appreciative!	1																					
525	525	528	301									Then she whacks you on your back hard.																						
526	526	528	301								Hippocrates	That's right, but don't forget the doctors and nurses who took care of you as well.	1																					
527	527		301								Hippocrates	And the modern technology they used! You wouldn't be standing if not for the advancements in medical science.	1

534	534		301							1	Hassen	We were together monitoring Liv's situation.	1																					
535	535		301								Hassen	We saw the signal alert to your cubicle light up, so we had Professor Hippocrates check on you first.	1																					
536	536		301								Asimov	...You look good, all things considered.	2																					
537	537		302								It's been a while.	538	Sorry, I overslept.	538																				
538	538		301								Asimov	Liv is in grave danger right now. Her M.I.N.D. is being infected repeatedly.	2																					
539	539		302								I see.	540																						
540	540		201							1	500404		-400																					
541	541		301							1	Hippocrates	What do you see? You haven't the slightest clue.	1																					
542	542		201							1	500011		-400																					
543	543		301							1	Hassen	The Professor has told us about your plan. It's a shot in the dark, a glimmer of hope with absolutely no guarantees.	1																					
544	544		301								Asimov	Liv's M.I.N.D. has been through the wringer. It's impossible to connect to her right now, let alone treat it through the connection.	2																					
545	545		301								Asimov	If you were to attempt it, you'd have to first connect remotely with another Gray Raven member, using them as a medium to force your way inside Liv's M.I.N.D. when they are in close proximity.	2																					
546	546		301								Asimov	You can only have a chance to connect with Liv by keeping a piece of her M.I.N.D. shard safe and stopping the data and the Punishing Virus from conglomerating.	2																					
547	547		302								That couldn't be all of it.	548	Would that do it?	548																				
548	548		301								Asimov	Forcing your way into an infected M.I.N.D. will result in your consciousness flushing into the data stream. You will be at risk of infection from the Punishing Virus and disruption from an information overload.	2																					
549	549		301								Asimov	It could result in both you and your "medium" getting infected.	2																					
550	550		201							1	500404		-400																					
551	551		301							1	Hippocrates	You'll have to get close if you want a connection to her Deep M.I.N.D.	1																					
552	552		301								Hippocrates	There is still a large amount of Hetero-Creatures gathered down there. You just woke up, and your mobility will be limited even with your exoskeleton.	1																					
553	553		302								Please allow me to bring some companions with me.	554																						
554	554		201							1	500011		-400																					
555	555		301							1	Hassen	I'm planning to send in a huge fleet of transport crafts to bring the recovered Constructs back. Of course I'll send people to guard your way to Liv.	1

557	557		301							1	Hippocrates	...	1																					
558	558		302								Are there still other concerns?	559																						
559	559		301								Hippocrates	A lot.	1																					
560	560		301								Hippocrates	For example, Liv's EMP discharge collar is counting down while her infection rate is climbing.	1																					
561	561		301								Hippocrates	Even if it all goes smoothly... Her M.I.N.D. is a jumbled mess already. You can't fix it with a connection.	1																					
562	562		302								Is there a way to treat it?	563																						
563	563		204							1	14																							
564	564		301								Hippocrates	Yes, but there will be lasting aftereffects.	1																					
565	565		302								...	566																						
566	566		301								Hippocrates	Look, I'm glad the patient I've been looking after has woken up. But please consider again whether or not to save Liv.	1																					
567	567		301								Hippocrates	The effects she will suffer are worse than what we anticipated. Surviving could be a worse torment for her.	1																					
568	568		302								We'll let her decide when she lives and returns.	569																						
569	569		301								Hippocrates	...	1																					
570	570		201							2	500011		400																					
571	571		301							1	Hassen	【kuroname】, as the President, I am inclined to keep Babylonia's elites alive. I hope you'll reconsider your decision.	2																					
572	572		301								Hassen	This is an extremely dangerous battle with a very low chance of success. Failure could spell your doom.	2																					
573	573		301								Hassen	You will be risking your life for a chance, just a chance, to save her.	2																					
574	574		301								Hassen	You're a commandant with a bright future. Now is not the time for you to fall.	2																					
575	575		302								There won't even be a chance if I stay.	576																						
576	576		301								Hassen	Do you still insist on going after knowing the threats you will face?	2																					
577	577		302								I do.	578																						
578	578		301								Hassen	Can you tell me why?	2																					
579	579		302								Because Liv chose the same.	580	Because Liv is my companion.	580																				
580	580		301				DialogDisable				Hassen	...	2																					
581	581		302								You feel the same, don't you, Mr. President?	582																						
582	582		302								Despite what you've been saying...	583																						
583	583		302								You haven't stopped me with a direct order.	584																						
584	584		302								You even promised to send people to protect me.	585																						
585	585		301			DialogEnable					Hassen	...	2

588	588		301								Hippocrates	Mr. President...!	1																					
589	589		301								Hassen	It's not like you to give up without a fight, Professor Hippocrates. The younger you would be kicking and screaming.	2																					
590	590		204							1																								
591	591		301								Hippocrates	...	1																					
592	592		301								Hassen	Prepare to depart, 【kuroname】. We'll continue when you're on the transport craft. Otherwise, you'll be too late.	2																					
593	593		301								Hippocrates	Come back in one piece, or I'll cut you up myself.	1																					
594	594		302								I'll try my best to avoid that.	595	I'll come back with all of them.	595
