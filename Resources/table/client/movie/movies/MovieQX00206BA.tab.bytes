4	4		301							1	Kamui	A mystery box? So you don't know what's inside either?	1																					
5	5		302								I don't.	6																						
6	6		301								Kamui	Oh, the anticipation! What do you think it will be?	1																					
7	7		301									Smiling cheerfully, Kamui tears open the wrapping paper and reveals a corner of the box.

9	9		301								Kamui	PST5000! This is the portable game console they just released not too long ago! I signed up multiple times and still couldn't get in the queue! COM-MAN-DANT!	1																					
10	10		301									Kamui's eyes glisten excitedlyâ€”this seems to be exactly what he wants. Still, you are amazed to find the rare gaming device considered by the Astrology Club...																						
11	11		301									But then, Kamui's smile freezesâ€”he opens the box of the PST5000 to find a much flatter box.																						
12	12		204							1	17																							
13	13		301									His expression is going on a rollercoaster ride right now. Taking out the box, he is brimming with joy again.																						
14	14		204							1	2																							
15	15		301								Kamui	It's "Spacefield"! This game is right on top of my wishlist! Commandant, my heart is beating so fast, and I don't even have a heart.	1																					
16	16		302								My heart almost stops beating, on the other hand.	17																						
17	17		301								Kamui	But! I'm glad it's Starfield instead. I was kinda worried about what to give you back just then. The PST5000 is way too expensive, after all.	1																					
18	18		301									Kamui opens the box and indeed finds a game cartridge inside, except... something does not look right.																						
19	19		301									He takes it out and finds a small sticker on it that says, "Deep Space Exploration, A Documentaryâ€”Remastered 2.0".																						
20	20		204							1	17																							
21	21		301								Kamui	...This is a terrible prank, Commandant! You have to sign up for the PST5000 ordering queue with me as compensation!	1																					
22	22		204							1	1																							
23	23		301								Kamui	Deep Space Exploration... that sounds pretty interesting too. Let's watch it together next time!	1																					
24	24		302		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Sure. I'll go sign up now...
