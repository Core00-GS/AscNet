32	32		301									The triangulated coordinates are located not far below Hans' team. Based on the previous exploration, you have all confirmed that is where the advanced Hetero-Hive Mother is hiding.																						
33	33		301									Hans grips the trigger for the Longinus Arsenal in his hand tightly. He looks at the floor beneath his feet as if his gaze can penetrate the heavy platform, observing the fight that is about to happen there.																						
34	34		301									The dire situation on the surface and the threat inside the Pulia Forest Park Ruins have shown Hans that the advanced Hetero-Hive Mother cannot leave this area alive.																						
35	35		301									If Gray Raven cannot defeat it by the end of the fight, he must pull this trigger and annihilate all the enemies inside this forest, whether they succeed in retrieving the samples or not.																						
36	36		301									Hans puts the trigger back inside his coat and leads his team out of the room.

42	42		301									It is even bigger, more complete than the test subject you saw before. Your terminals keep warning you that this is the target of your mission, the advanced Hetero-Hive mother.																						
43	43		301									Crimson umbilical cords extend from around you, connecting to the Hive Mother, some of them hanging helplessly like withered roots. This is the queen of the Hive, the central processor of all the data received outside.

63	63		202							1					1																			
64	64		301									The Hive Mother is mumbling gibberish like the one did in the sewers, which confirms the connection between that one and the one before you—the Ascendant's aid.																						
65	65		301									Immediately, its tentacles strike at you with unfathomable speed.

72	72		301									Lucia rushes before you, her red katana unsheathed, severing the tentacle reaching for you.																						
73	73		301									The thruster behind her buzzes. Even with the exoskeleton and its temperature regulator, you can still feel the temperature around you dropping.																						
74	74		301									A freezing breeze emits from Lucia's thruster, and the Hetero-Hive Mother's movement is visibly slowing down.																						
75	75		401							2	555																							
76	76		301									That state only lasts but a second. As Lucia raises her blade and thrusts at the gap in the Hetero-Hive Mother's shell, it suddenly bursts with immense strength and dodges, putting some distance between them.																						
77	77		302								Liv.	78																						
78	78		401							2	592

89	89		402					300		631																								
90	90		301									Like the first time, however, the bullet hits its shell and ricochets to the side, leaving a mark on the wall of the CPF.

100	100		301									With your command, Lee presses the button on the machines nearby.																						
101	101		301									Ever since you fired your first bullet, Lee has been sneaking to the side and trying to repair those devices.																						
102	102		301									While the rest of you tried to draw the Hetero-Hive Mother's attention, buying him time.																						
103	103		301									The mechanical devices buzz, and the Punishing Virus concentration in the area begins to decrease.																						
104	104		301									The rhythmic contraction of the Hetero-Hive Mother's shell sped up as a reaction to the change.																						
105	105		301									Every push inward stresses its exterior immensely, giving it a seizure.																						
106	106		301									But this is not a phenomenon you know about regarding the Hetero-Hive Mother when the Punishing Virus concentration lowers.

111	111		401					300		2	662																							
112	112		301									Your doubt lingers but a moment. The window of opportunity the Gray Ravens have created must be seized, so you hold down the trigger on your gun, aiming not at the shells, but the countless umbilical cords above it.

117	117		301									They snap, one after another, these wires that upload information from the outside.																						
118	118		301									The broken ends of the cords start to wilt and pale. The scarlet liquid cannot hold its own weight and spills from the broken cords, dripping over the Hetero-Hive Mother before flowing to the ground.																						
119	119		302								That's...	120																						
120	120		301									You notice a hint of black liquid within the redness, coming not from the broken umbilical cords but the pulsating, retracting shells of the Hetero-Hive Mother.

122	122		301							1	Hetero-Hive Mother	No... no...	1

125	125		301									Lucia leaps forward, encompassing the Hetero-Hive Mother with her unbroken, tidal-like strikes.																						
126	126		202							1					1																			
127	127		301									Within the glistening reflections, the Hetero-Hive Mother curls up on the ground in a strange position, its shells trembling from the blade and its retraction, as if they are going to be peeled away from the pressure.																						
128	128		402							610																								
129	129		301									Still, it is lowering its center of gravity, making sure the part underneath the shells does not get hit by Lucia.																						
130	130		301									Gray Raven has carried out your plan, removing the Hive Mother from its nutrients, ceasing its access to the outside world, and pinning it down. It is just a matter of time before you defeat it and retrieve the samples.																						
131	131		301									Despite the scale of victory tipping your way, you still cannot shake the uneasiness ever since you entered the Pulia Forest Park Ruins.																						
132	132		301									Accessing information about the outside world through the Hetero-Sapiens...																						
133	133		301									Collecting more Punishing Virus than it needs as nutrients...																						
134	134		301									Rhythmic retraction and the strange liquid...																						
135	135		301									And its posture, seemingly protecting something underneath.																						
136	136		301									All the dissonance you have been feeling weaves together around the Hetero-Hive Mother.																						
137	137		302								Watch out, everyone.	138	The Hive Mother isn't the only enemy here.	138

142	142		401							1	55																							
143	143		301									The Hetero-Hive Mother's body soars up, pulled by the remaining umbilical cords still attached. Lucia's strikes leave a few frightening scars on its shells.																						
144	144		301									They retract and push continuously, revealing the strange, red structure underneath it.																						
145	145		301									Black liquid keeps dripping down the red structure. The seizure is getting more intense, but the Hetero-Hive Mother no longer cares about the pain it is feeling.																						
146	146		301									The revealed red structure bulges outward from the pressure, the shape hidden inside its translucent skin getting clearer and clearer.																						
147	147		302								A human figure...	148																						
148	148		301									Your guess is only half correct.																						
149	149		301									There is indeed more than one enemy from the very beginning. The Hetero-Hive Mother has been hiding something else.																						
150	150		301									"Children," ready to be born.																						
151	151		301									If Hetero-Creatures have the concept of childbirth, that is.																						
152	152		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Two figures break through the edge of the red structure, black liquid spilling around them.

157	157		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						With the last drop of liquid emptied, the two figures drop to the ground.																						
158	158		301									After it has seemingly given birth, the weakened Hetero-Hive Mother is hung mid-air by the remaining umbilical cords, its tentacles swaying in the air from gravity.																						
159	159		301								Hetero-Hive Mother	My... my children...																						
160	160		301									Everyone grabs hold of their weapons instinctively. The tremendous pressure makes it difficult to breathe.																						
161	161		301									If the Hetero-Sapiens were imitating humans after the Red Tide devoured them, similar to the projections, then the two before you have transcended imitation. They are crafted and polished, the perfect human-like products.																						
162	162		301									Their hollow eyes sweep the Gray Ravens, but you do not feel them focusing on you at all.																						
163	163		301									Their gaze pierces through the crowd and extends toward the species you belong to—humanity.																						
164	164		301								Unidentified Twin: Male	...Este no es nuestro final. (This is not our final destination.)																						
165	165		301								Unidentified Twin: Female	Rest, my friend.																						
166	166		301									For some reason, their voices feel oddly familiar to you, as if they were not the ones who were speaking, but someone else.																						
167	167		301									The man and woman's speech is so far removed from the stuttering of the Hetero-Sapiens. It is clear that they have gathered enough knowledge from the countless Hetero-Sapiens out there in the park.																						
168	168		301									It has taken them but a dozen seconds from birth to fluent speeches. But their blank expressions tell you that they are still mimicking phrases others have said instead of presenting their own ideas through language.																						
169	599		301									The urgent situation makes it difficult to think about who they are mimicking.																						
170	169		401							2	559																							
171	170		301			RImgBg1Shake						The enemies raise their hands, and a strange gush of wind blows past you.																						
172	171		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Hetero-Creatures seem to have evolved to a new height at that moment.
