261	270		301							1	Asimov	The Council would be happy to hear that. You're the only one who's ever allowed your consciousness to be connected to Camu's. That's why we had to send the two of you together.	1																					
262	271		302								So you're not giving me a choice?	272	Yeah.	272

264	273		301							1	Lee	If you're sure that 【kuroname】 is the only Commandant who can connect to Camu remotely, you should work even harder to keep 【kuroname】 safe.	1

266	275		301							1	Asimov	Rest easy. I've checked your Commandant from head to toe. Brain's still intact, nerves perfectly functioning. Just a bloody nose and nothing more.	1																					
267	276		301								Asimov	I'll give a full report to the Council on what went down in the simulated mission. Meanwhile, it'd be wise for you to postpone any combat training activities of this type.	1																					
268	277		302								I'm still worried...	278	Okay, then.	278

276	285		302								...	286	I'll be careful.	286

283	292		301									The three Gray Raven members gaze at you, each with a slightly different expression. All you can do is to push your still aching body up and look as relaxed as possible.																						
284	293		302								(Guess something needs to be done...)	294																						
285	294		301									They all seem to have something stuck in their throats, so you tactfully break the silence.																						
286	295		302								That's it for today, then.	296	Anything else?	300

304	314		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You open the door to see Camu sitting on the bench in the corridor.																						
305	315		301									Noticing your arrival, he turns around, expression one of indescribable dark fury. He briefly scans the faces of the group and looks away.																						
306	316		301									You gesture for everyone to relax before they can speak.																						
307	317		302								I have business to attend to.	318	You guys can leave now.	318																				
308	318		301									Though worried, the others hold their tongues, nod and leave one by one.																						
309	319		301									Camu remains on his bench, staring resolutely at his own interlocked fingers, resting primly on his knees. He looks like a student outside the principal's office waiting for his punishment.

314	324		302								The creeps?	325	That's mean!	325																				
315	325		301								Camu	That spooky nerd barely answered any of my questions. So annoying.	1																					
316	326		301								Camu	Just tell us what you guys have decided.	1																					
317	327		302								"We" didn't decide anything.	328	I want to discuss something with you.	329																				
318	328	330	301								Camu	You mean you were the only one who made the decision?	1																					
319	329		301								Camu	Just get to the point.	1																					
320	330		301								Camu	If you have something to say, say it.	1

322	332	335	301								Camu	...What?	1																					
323	333		301								Camu	W-what? Are you nuts?	1																					
324	334		302								Just kidding!	335	You have no sense of humor.	335																				
325	335		301								Camu	I'll give you another chance to reword that. What did you mean?	1																					
326	336		302								It'd help us work better together.	337	It'd help us hone certain skills.	337																				
327	337		301								Camu	But we only failed the mission because you were useless!	1																					
328	338		302								That's why we gotta train.	339																						
329	339		301								Camu	So you want me to sacrifice my private hours to train with you? I have no interest in socializing with my colleagues after work.	1																					
330	340		302								I just want to talk.	341	It'll be fun, promise.	341																				
331	341		301								Camu	If I have to work with a human like you, you'll drag me down no matter how much we train.	1																					
332	342		302								Why don't we give it a try?	343																						
333	343		301								Camu	I refuse.	1																					
334	344		302								I'll wait for you to come around.	345																						
335	345		301								Camu	Huh? Where did you inherit that stupid persistence now?	1																					
336	346		302								It's a Commandant's sense of responsibility.	347

341	351		301								Camu	If you really have the best interests of your team in mind, you gotta make sure your idiot supervisors realize that getting to know me better wouldn't benefit you any. You need to understand this.																						
342	352		301								Camu	If I can solve something with a fight, I will.																						
343	353		302								Make me understand, then.	354	...	355
