4	4		301			DialogEnable						No. 21 rushes toward the basement after the battle is over.																						
5	5		301									Standing before the door to the basement‚Äîno, it is not a door anymore. Bloody handprints and scratches left by metal claws envelop it, turning it into a silent gravestone.																						
6	6		401							2	1516																							
7	7		301									No. 21 gently opens the door and steps in.																						
8	8		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The hidden memories unveil once more.																						
9	9		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
10	10		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You cannot see anything at first. There is only the rotten, moldy smell of the basement and the touches of the heaps of junk as you run into them.																						
11	11		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Then a bright light tears down the darkness. You cannot help but open the door slightly and look out carefully through the gap, and all you can see is a corner of the staircase.

13	13		401							1	43																							
14	14		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The sound of metal dragging over the wooden floor gives you a shiver. Then you hear the heavy thud of a body hitting something, and nothing after that.																						
15	15		301									An impulsion drives you to scream Lucia's name... but you must not. You bite down your lips as if the pain can keep your fear in check. But the pain is nothing in comparison.																						
16	16		301									Dead silence.																						
17	17		301									You thought you could hear thunder before realizing that is just your heart beating loudly.																						
18	18		301									The artificial heart is wailing and thumping because of the memory of someone unrelated.																						
19	19		301									The longer the silence lasts, the more your desperation grows. The darkness in the basement weighs on your back, almost breaking you.																						
20	20		401			RImgBg1Shake				2	1512																							
21	21		301									Then you hear a loud bang near you as a body in red and black rolls down the stairs and lands at its base.																						
22	22		302								No...	23																						
23	23		301									You subconsciously cover your mouth, trying desperately not to scream.																						
24	24		301									After a few seconds, or maybe longer, the body shifts, followed by a painful moan.																						
25	25		301									The young Lucia crawls on the floor, her tiny arms supporting her body as she slowly climbs up.																						
26	26		301									Blood drips down her temple, dying her eyes, collars, and fingers red.																						
27	27		302								L-Lucia...	28																						
28	28		301									Weakly you cry out, powerless to do anything.																						
29	29		301									But the horror is not over. A large shadow cast from the top of the stairs shrouds Lucia's body. She cannot even stand straight.																						
30	30		301									But she looks fearless.																						
31	31		301									Taking its time, the monster walks down the stairs, its shadow encroaching.																						
32	32		301			RImgBg1Shake						Before you can react, the door to the basement is pushed open. Sunlight pours in, and the orange, warm glow coats you as you stand at the door.																						
33	33		302								I won't let you hurt her‚Äî	34																						
34	34		301									The blood is pumping in your veins like a tidal wave, thunderous and earthshaking.																						
35	35		301									You raise the "weapon" in your hands, your heartbeat so loud that it drowns out the monster's shriek. All you can see is the wounded, bloody girl lying before you.																						
36	36		301									‚ÄîEven when your "weapon" is nothing but a ridiculous stuffed animal.																						
37	37		201							1	500032	14																						
38	38		301							1	Lucia	LUNA!!	1																					
39	39		301									Lucia's expression changes‚Äîa fear she has not shown even when confronting the horrid Corrupted.																						
40	40		202							1					1																			
41	41		401							2	1512																							
42	42		301			RImgBg1Shake						She tries to run toward you, but the pain causes her to fall again. So she starts crawling.																						
43	43		301								Lucia	Luna! GO BACK!	1																					
44	44		302								I can protect you too... I want to protect you‚Äî	47																						
45	45		201							1	500013																							
46	46		401							2	1508																							
47	47		301							1		Before she can finish, the Corrupted, its eyes glowing bright crimson, leaps toward you, noticing its new prey.	1

52	52		301							1	No. 21	N-NO‚Äî	1																					
53	53		301									No. 21 reaches out, but she catches nothing.																						
54	54		204							1																								
55	55		401							1	207																							
56	56		301								No. 21	...	1																					
57	57		301								No. 21	...What happened next?	1																					
58	58		301									This is as far as the memory goes. You have no idea if Luna has lost the memory of what followed, or if she refuses to remember them.																						
59	59		301								No. 21	Am I hurt?	1																					
60	60		301									No, 21 touches her face. Her cheeks are cold to the touch, but there is nothing there.																						
61	61		204							1	3																							
62	62		301								No. 21	...Something important is lost.	1																					
63	63		302								...You're right.	65																						
64	64		204							1																								
65	65		301									These feelings are alien to her. Having never experienced, seen, or felt something like this, No. 21 just stands there, perplexed.																						
66	66		204							1	3																							
67	67		301								No. 21	I... don't like this feeling.	1																					
68	68		301								No. 21	She has done... so many bad things.	1																					
69	69		204							1	4																							
70	70		301								No. 21	Why is she showing me this?	1																					
71	71		302								She's not the one showing us this.	72																						
72	72		202							1					1																			
73	73		301									It is difficult for you to explain it to her, so you give No. 21 a simple explanation.																						
74	74		301									"Everyone has a past. Even when you think your past is a blank... it is still a past."																						
75	75		301									"Everyone becomes who they are because of what they have been through. Your past made you who you are. Maybe I'm not the ideal person to tell you this way..."																						
76	76		301									"But... do you like who you are now? Do you like what you have?"																						
77	77		301									"If you do, then don't deny your past. The past isn't the point, nor is it the future... It's now. Here and now."																						
78	78		301									"This is Luna's past... That's it."																						
79	79		302								(Tell her what you think)	80																						
80	80		401							2	10007502																							
81	81		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Right then, you hear a loud bang from the door.
