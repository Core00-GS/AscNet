4	4		301			DialogEnable				1		After defeating the enemies, we quickly ran up the stairs and went through many battle scenes that didn't really match the background settings.																						
5	5		301							1	Karenina	These scenes have nothing to do with our main plot!	1

7	6		301							1	Camu	I guess Celica only had access to these materials. We're lucky that we aren't stuck. When I watched Kamui play other games...	1																					
8	1002		302								You are always talking about Kamui.	7	Who's better at playing games, you or Kamui?	8																				
9	7	9	301								Camu	Ahem... Not at all. I just happen to inherit all the game-related topics from his memory!	1																					
10	8	9	301								Camu	Isn't it obvious? I will never lose to that fool in anything.	1																					
11	9		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Eventually, we jumped across a staircase (broken for no reason) and arrived at a special room.

15	10		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	???	I have been watching you since you approached the castle... You took a long time to get here, heroes.	1																					
16	11		301									Apart from some enemies that we previously encountered, there was one figure that gave a very different feel.

19	12		301							1	Karenina	Hey, you are the Demon General, aren't you?	2																					
20	13		301									Vera and Camu were ready to start fighting, but Karenina walked forward and triggered the dialogue.																						
21	14		301									It wasn't because she liked to follow orders, but because she preferred to ask the enemies' names before beating them.																						
22	15		301									Either way, the enemy would still be beaten up, but at least it felt better than straight-forward violence. 																						
23	16		301							1	Zanzibaron	Right. I am Demon General Zanzibaron.	1																					
24	17		301									Zanzibaron—I had no clue where that name came from—moved one step forward, dragging his gigantic body.																						
25	18		301							1	Zanzibaron	You must be the heroes in the revelation. I knew you were coming, but I didn't expect you to come so fast.	1																					
26	1008		302								What are "heroes in the revelation"?	19	Did you know we were coming since the beginning?	22																				
27	19	20	301								Zanzibaron	How can you be heroes but not know the legend of the revelation? How did you even get here?	1																					
28	20	21	301								Karenina	Because we skipped the story.	2																					
29	21	25	301								Zanzibaron	In the Goddess' revelation, there would be heroes...	1																					
30	22	23	301								Zanzibaron	Aye, we Demons rely on our perception to survive...	1																					
31	23	24	301								Zanzibaron	"Survive"? You say it like you are on the brink of extinction.	1																					
32	24	25	301								Zanzibaron	Right, because...	1																					
33	25		301								Karenina	Stop. I wasn't interested in your story, and I will not listen to it. Learning your name is more than enough!	2

37	27		301									Well, Karenina was only following her own rules. She forced to start the battle when Zanzibaron was still trying to explain the background settings.																						
38	28		301									Fusion Dragon smashed on Zanzibaron's face like a giant club.

42	29		301							1	Vera	Camu, are sneak attacks like that allowed in the game?	2																					
43	30		301								Camu	"I don't see any problems. That looked like a compulsory battle to me. 【kuroname】, we are about to engage in multiple battles. I assume you will give orders, right?"	1																					
44	1013		302								I thought you didn't need me.	32	Of course!	32																				
45	31	33	301								Camu	We can easily tackle the minions, but Boss fight can be very demanding. You do the thinking, we do the action.	1																					
46	32	33	301								Camu	Hmph, good to know. It's a Boss after all, we need all the available resources!	1
