6	5		301							1	Gabriel	Target sighted. Recycling now.	1

8	7		301							1	Ayla	Wait... What's that?	1																					
9	8		201							1	500101																							
10	9		301							1		Ayla notices the extremely high corruption level of the tall enemy, and realizes what was happening.																						
11	10		301									But just when she starts to attack, Selena is already ripped off the terminal—																						
12	11		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiHitNew.prefab		1																						
13	13		301			PanelActor1Shake						The enemy then turns around and takes Ayla's strike with his broad shoulders.																						
14	14		201							1	500110	4																						
15	15		301							1	Ayla	What?	1

18	18		301			PanelActor1Shake				1		Ayla does not hesitate for one second. She unleashes numerous attacks with her scythe.																						
19	19		301									Strangely, the enemy does not want to engage in the fight. Instead, he keeps moving back.																						
20	20		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Once he reaches the cabin door, he leaps toward the gravity room's core area...

23	23		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After bumping into Gray Raven in the gravity room, Ayla follows Gabriel to a shattered floating platform—																						
24	24		401							2	10007502																							
25	25		301			RImgBg1Shake						Boom—																						
26	26		201							1	500101																							
27	27		301							1		Gabriel flips over and fires a shot. He uses the counterforce to jump through the opening on the wall, which is a result of the previous blast.																						
28	28		201							1	500110	4																						
29	29		301							1	Ayla	Ugh—!	1																					
30	30		301									After the heat from the explosion dissipates...																						
31	31		301								Ayla	Oh no...	1																					
32	32		301								Ayla	Before he gets away, I must...	1																					
33	33		301									Just when Ayla is about to follow him, a mechanic claw protrudes from the edge of the platform.																						
34	34		301								Ayla	?	1																					
35	35		201							1	500119																							
36	36		301							1		The claw continues to climb toward the platform surface, finally revealing itself.																						
37	37		301								Korolev	Humans... must be... destroyed...	1																					
38	38		301									It is Korolev. After the battle with Gray Raven, it fell into the vacuum turbulence, but somehow managed to survive space.																						
39	39		301								Korolev	Destroy...	1																					
40	40		201							1	500110	4																						
41	41		301							1	Ayla	Now of all times!	1

44	44		301								Ayla	Hah—!																						
45	45		301									Before Korolev could attack again, Ayla cuts its remaining structure in half, completely annihilating it.																						
46	46		301									However, she has also wasted precious time.																						
47	47		201							1	500110	4																						
48	48		301							1		Ayla looks at the opening to space—																						
49	49		301								Ayla	I must hurry...	1

51	51		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Right at this time—																						
52	53		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png																								
53	54		301			AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin					A huge beam goes through the opening and hits the Punishing Heteromer directly.																						
54	56		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory112.png																								
55	57		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The gravity room is a mess...																						
56	58		201							1	500110	4																						
57	59		301							1		Ayla struggles to maintain balance on the floating platform. She keeps telling herself one thing.																						
58	60		301								Ayla	I mustn't stop. Otherwise, Selena would...	1																					
59	61		202							1					1																			
60	62		301									One by one, she keeps leaping toward the next floating platform.																						
61	63		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Jumping, dodging, spinning, and slashing through anything in her way.

66	67		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		Step after step, Ayla finally makes it out of the space station.																						
67	68		202							1					1																			
68	69		301									There are huge explosions on the low Earth orbit in the distance. But Ayla has no attention to spare—																						
69	70		201							1	500110	4																						
70	71		301							1	Ayla	Selena!	1																					
71	72		301									Still, she is one step too late...																						
72	73		202							1					1																			
73	74		301									The door of the capsule, where Gabriel and Selena are in, has closed. The launch procedure has been initiated...																						
74	75		201							1	500110	4																						
75	76		301							1	Ayla	Wait... Selena!	1																					
76	77		301									Ayla runs with all her might on the outer surface of the space station.																						
77	78		301									But the capsule has already taken off. No matter what she does, it only moves further away...																						
78	79		301									Only the heat from the capsule's exhaust flames remains, scorching Ayla's body.																						
79	80		301								Ayla	...	1																					
80	81		301									All she can do is to silently watch the capsule as it flies toward Earth.																						
81	82		301								Ayla	Earth...	1																					
82	83		301									Ayla mumbles to herself. She already knows her next step.																						
83	84		204							1																								
84	85		301								Ayla	There's still a chance... There must be...	1
