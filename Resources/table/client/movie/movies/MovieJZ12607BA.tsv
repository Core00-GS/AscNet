3	3		301			DialogEnable						As one of the best shops selling mechanical components on the Nighter, Jinman's Emporium only has one customer on the day the ship docks for a market.																						
4	4		301									It has been closed for a while since the Corrupted attack a few days ago. Some of the usual customers were poached by other competitors.																						
5	5		301									But Jin Man is not worried. He is confident that his business will boom again in three months—but now, he has to figure out how to solve the problem at hand.																						
6	6		301									And so, he is determined to wrestle out Grubs from every person who walks through his door.																						
7	7		201							1	500240																							
8	8		301							1	Jin Man	What is it that you are looking for? Our shop has all kinds of components. I'm sure we can find you anything of any specification.	1																					
9	9		203							1	0.25	-450																						
10	10		201							2	500465		450																					
11	11		301							1	???	Do you have these parts?	2																					
12	12		301									Jin Man inspects the serial numbers on the list. The dense code might as well be hieroglyphics to an outsider, but Jin Man lives and breathes them.																						
13	13		301								Jin Man	These are mostly parts from the Golden Age... many of which are very rare...	1																					
14	14		301								???	No luck, is it? I'll look somewhere else then...	2																					
15	15		301								Jin Man	Don't! I can find them! If Jinman's Emporium can't find it, no shop on this ship can find it either.	1																					
16	16		301								???	...	2																					
17	17		301									The already massive customer is wearing a large windbreaker, revealing a fully mechanical face. Jin Man has no idea what his guest is thinking.																						
18	18		301								???	Deal. I'll need 100 of each part on the list.	2																					
19	19		301								Jin Man	100?! Are you sure... That will cost you a fortune.	1																					
20	20		301								???	Don't worry.	2																					
21	21		301									In that instance, Jin Man receives a 25% deposit. He is surprised—generous and rich customers are rare these days.																						
22	22		301								???	Do you sell mechanoids here?	2																					
23	23		301								Jin Man	Certainly. Come with me.	1																					
24	24		202							1	2				1																			
25	25		301									Jin Man brings his guest to the back room, where a series of mechanoids are displayed.																						
26	26		201							1	500240		-450																					
27	27		201							2	500465		450																					
28	28		301							1	???	This one... I've seen her in the market before.	2																					
29	29		301									The customer stands before a glass display case, where a mechanoid with a human-like face and body lies. No one can tell she is a machine from her appearance.																						
30	30		301								Jin Man	Were you there during that whole commotion...? Then you should know that she is completely broken and she wouldn't start since that day. Even the Fuxi from the Kowloong Crew couldn't figure out why.	1																					
31	31		301								Jin Man	Right now, she's just stored here by a stubborn girl who hopes to find someone that can fix her... The girl even said that she might live again if they can find the legendary "Sagemachina".	1																					
32	32		301								Jin Man	But a legend is just a legend, nothing more. A self-aware machine... it's just a story for kids.	1																					
33	33		301									Jin Man laughs before he speaks again self-deprecatingly.																						
34	34		301								Jin Man	But I'm starting to get confused ever since I saw this mechanoid here. Perhaps machines really can have souls like humans one day.	1																					
35	35		301								???	What if I tell you I'm one of Sagemachina's apostles?	2																					
36	36		301									Jin Man's jaw almost drops before he immediately bursts into laughter.																						
37	37		301								Jin Man	You're a funny one!	1																					
38	38		301								???	This mechanoid's "soul" has yet to depart. She's been having the same dream over and over again... Perhaps it is what sustains her consciousness still.	2																					
39	39		301								Jin Man	A machine dreaming? I've never heard of that in the many years I ran a shop.	1																					
40	40		301								???	I must take her with me... Perhaps only Sagemachina knows how to wake her up.	2																					
41	41		301									The massive customer writes down a series of illegible codes and hands it to Jin Man.																						
42	42		301								???	If the girl comes here again, give this to her...	2																					
43	43		301								Jin Man	This is...	1																					
44	44		301								???	They are words whispered by the lingering soul in that mechanoid. The mechanoid next to the girl will translate them for her.	2																					
45	45		202							1	2				1																			
46	46		301									Jin Man's guest heads for the door before turning around with a hat tip.																						
47	47		201							1	500465																							
48	48		301							1	???	I'm sure... she'll understand what they mean.	1																					
49	49		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The customer takes a last look at the mechanoid inside the display case before going away.																						
50	50		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
51	51		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					???	A machine and a human, so profoundly entangled...																						
52	52		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				???	Who can tell if that's fortunate or unfortunate?
