4	4		301							1	Changyu	East City's Xujiu Street... Wang's Pawn Shop, this is the last store.	1																					
5	5		202							1					1																			
6	6		301									Changyu is standing in front of a building and sifting through his memories. Seeing that it is still the same building as before, he enters the premises.																						
7	7		301									In the pawnshop, a middle-aged man is sitting behind the counter, looking down at the panel in his hand. In his other, an old copper coin is being absentmindedly twirled.																						
8	8		201							1	500230																							
9	9		301							1	Changyu	Boss Wang? I saw that you're hiring, so...	1																					
10	10		301								Boss Wang	Huh? But what's a kiddo like you doing here?																						
11	11		301								Changyu	Age isn't a problem. I can do whatever it is you need.	1																					
12	12		301								Boss Wang	Know your way around machines?																						
13	13		301									Boss Wang slowly raises his head and taps a coin on the table. His indifferent tone feels like a sharp knife to Changyu's ears.																						
14	14		204							1	14																							
15	15		301								Changyu	I, um... No, I don't.	1																					
16	16		301								Boss Wang	Then shoo.																						
17	17		301								Boss Wang	You can't possibly think the KCC still has any use for elbow grease now, do you?																						
18	18		301								Changyu	I...	1																					
19	19		301								Boss Wang	Oh... I see. You're from the old parts down south. No wonder.																						
20	20		301								Boss Wang	Well then, be on your way. I don't have any use for a kid like you.																						
21	21		301									Boss Wang waves his hand at the door, motioning for Changyu to leave. Hearing this, Changyu takes a step forward instead.																						
22	22		204							1	5																							
23	23		301								Changyu	It's not like that. Some things are best left to people.	1																					
24	24		301								Boss Wang	Oh? And what's that? I'm all ears.																						
25	25		204							1																								
26	26		301								Changyu	Like... Pawning... You know, sales!	1																					
27	27		301								Changyu	Machines might replace the need for people in the service, manufacturing, or entertainment industries because they are good at imitating humans.	1																					
28	28		301								Changyu	But the one they can't do is barter!	1																					
29	29		301								Changyu	Each customer is different. You need intuition and honesty to understand their needs to make money.	1																					
30	30		301								Boss Wang	Hmm, I see your point...																						
31	31		204							1	1																							
32	32		301								Changyu	Then‚Äî	1																					
33	33		301								Boss Wang	However‚Äî																						
34	34		301									Boss Wang drags out his rebuttal to interrupt Changyu's rambling.																						
35	35		301								Boss Wang	A person's speech and behavior are telltale signs of their thoughts. You speak with confidence, but your eyes darted four times over the place‚Äîindicating that you've been nervous this whole time.																						
36	36		301								Boss Wang	Machines only have to pick up on this to simulate human emotion and adjust their sales strategy accordingly. That's not specific to humans.																						
37	37		204							1																								
38	38		301								Changyu	...But that type of machine doesn't exist.	1																					
39	39		301								Boss Wang	Hmph, maybe you haven't heard...																						
40	40		202							1					1																			
41	41		301									Boss Wang remarks coldly. Just as he is about to continue speaking, Changyu suddenly steps forward and puts his hand on the copper coin resting on the table.																						
42	42		201							1	500230	5																						
43	43		301							1	Changyu	Think I don't know about the Fuxi Crew's research into human simulation?	1																					
44	44		301								Boss Wang	Oh? Looks like you aren't as naive as I thought.																						
45	45		301								Changyu	I heard it from some big shot a long time ago.	1																					
46	46		301								Changyu	But a machine like that isn't something normal folks like us can afford.	1																					
47	47		301								Changyu	So this kind of job is best left to us humans for the time being.	1																					
48	48		204							1																								
49	49		301								Changyu	Ain't nothing wrong with replacing us with machines. But until then, do you really think someone in your condition can look after the shop all by yourself?	1																					
50	50		301								Boss Wang	How'd you know about my condition?																						
51	51		204							1	1																							
52	52		301									Changyu lifts his hand off the coin and smiles.																						
53	53		301								Changyu	Hehe, my bro Chen at our theater used to have this problem. I was a bit hesitant when I walked in at first. I didn't want to say anything without a closer look.	1																					
54	54		301								Boss Wang	Sharp eh, kid?																						
55	55		301								Changyu	I'll take that as a compliment.	1																					
56	56		301								Boss Wang	Hmph.																						
57	57		301									Hearing this, Boss Wang scoffs and leaves the store.																						
58	58		301								Boss Wang	You work 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Six days a week. Salary is performance based.																						
59	59		301								Changyu	So that means that I'm...	1																					
60	60		301								Boss Wang	Hmph, you're starting tomorrow. Don't be late on your first day of work.																						
61	61		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Changyu	Alrighty!	1

65	65		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Changyu	Five thousand, here you are. Come again!	1																					
66	66		202							1					1																			
67	67		301									After seeing off the last customer, Changyu returns to the pawnshop and carefully seals the pawned item he just received.																						
68	68		301								Boss Wang	Hey, kiddo. Clean up and get ready to call it a day.																						
69	69		201							1	500230																							
70	70		301							1	Changyu	Huh, why so early today?	1																					
71	71		301								Boss Wang	It's not like I want to. I just received a notice from the Chiwen Crew. No business after 5 p.m.																						
72	72		301								Changyu	How come?	1																					
73	73		301								Boss Wang	It probably has to do with the news report released by the World Government. Some experiment failed, and there was some sort of repercussion.																						
74	74		301								Changyu	You mean zero-point energy?	1																					
75	75		301								Boss Wang	Yeah, that thing. But the only repercussion is our loss of business!																						
76	76		301								Changyu	No wonder the customers are all so sour-looking recently.	1																					
77	77		301								Boss Wang	Hmph, you can say that again.																						
78	78		301								Boss Wang	By the way, I also saw the notice that the celebration was postponed‚Äîthe one you mentioned earlier that your theater's playing at.																						
79	79		301								Changyu	What? It was postponed?!	1																					
80	80		301								Boss Wang	Can't help it. Hosting a celebration right now would be a slap in the face for the World Government.																						
81	81		301								Changyu	Ugh... At least it's not cancelled. We'll just have to wait for this all to pass. Then everything will be back to normal.	1																					
82	82		301								Boss Wang	We can only hope so. The sooner the curfew ends, the sooner we can open normally. I'm going to head out. Be sure to lock up once you're done cleaning.																						
83	83		301								Changyu	Yeah, got it.	1																					
84	84		301									After Boss Wang leaves, Changyu returns to the counter. He turns on his data panel and begins to flip through the calendar.																						
85	85		204							1	1																							
86	86		301								Changyu	It's delayed... But that's not necessarily a bad thing.	1																					
87	87		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Changyu	That gives me more time to prepare for the performance. Director, just you wait...	1																					
88	88		202							1					1																			
89	89		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory236.png

91	91		201							1	500230																							
92	92		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Changyu	Boss Wang, what's going on today? I've seen Pulao soldiers patrolling the streets.	1																					
93	93		301								Boss Wang	The whole city is under a curfew. The zero-point thingamajig failed and created some virus. Apparently, a machine will go haywire if it becomes infected.																						
94	94		301								Boss Wang	Now the soldiers are recycling machines, androids, and even all the police bots in the city‚Äîthe uh, Guardians and Tai'E, I think? Anyway, they're all gone. Heard they're roundin' them up and disposing them all at once.																						
95	95		301								Changyu	No wonder the Glazed Arch Theater next door has been so deserted recently. I thought they were upgrading the androids in preparation for something big during the celebration.	1																					
96	96		301								Boss Wang	Alright, enough chit-chat. Throw this out for me.																						
97	97		301									He throws Changyu a palm-sized robot from behind the counter. The electronic brain is hanging sideways, with indentations obviously caused by a blunt object. Several broken wires are also poking out of its casing.																						
98	98		301								Changyu	Isn't this the robot you bought to wipe the cabinet? How did this happen?	1																					
99	99		301								Boss Wang	The soldiers don't recycle these lil' gizmos. Hmph, but who's to say it won't get infected and wreck the shop?																						
100	100		301								Boss Wang	Don't just stand there. Get this eyesore out of here!																						
101	101		301								Changyu	...	1																					
102	102		202							1					1																			
103	103		301									Changyu picks up the broken pile of scrap metal and walks to the trash can in the alley around the corner.																						
104	104		301									...And he sees a trashcan filled to the brim with an assortment of mechanical parts‚Äîelectronic terminals, carrier drones, and other household gadgets.																						
105	105		301									The tools that once brought many conveniences to mankind were now completely destroyed and randomly discarded in the dark recesses of trash cans, mixed with foods scraps and other garbage.																						
106	106		201							1	500230																							
107	107		301							1	Changyu	Pah... That's the way humans got their jobs back, huh?	1																					
108	108		202							1					1																			
109	109		301									Changyu shakes his head as he walks out of the alley. He sees several strange devices in the street erected by the Baxia Crew.																						
110	110		301									Hearing the news, Boss Wang pokes his head out from the doorframe of the pawnshop and looks down the street.																						
111	111		301								Boss Wang	The KCC... is about to change.																						
112	112		201							1	500230																							
113	113		301								Changyu	Indeed...	1																					
114	114		301								Boss Wang	"Indeed"? What does a kid like you know?																						
115	115		301								Changyu	That's not what I meant...	1																					
116	116		301								Boss Wang	Here, take this.																						
117	117		301									Having no intention of arguing with Changyu, Boss Wang interrupts him by throwing him a data card.																						
118	118		301								Changyu	Huh? Didn't you already pay me this month?	1																					
119	119		204							1	1																							
120	120		301								Changyu	A cheapskate like you is giving me a bonus?!	1																					
121	121		301								Boss Wang	Who are you callin' a cheapskate? It's called running a well-managed business. You should take some notes.																						
122	122		301								Changyu	Whatever you say boss. As long as you keep paying me.	1																					
123	123		301								Boss Wang	Still playing the poverty card? Get out of here. I'm closing up shop.																						
124	124		301								Changyu	Alright, alright. Quit pushing me. I was just on my way out.	1																					
125	125		202							1					1																			
126	126		301									Boss Wang pushes Changyu out as he speaks and impatiently motions him to hurry home.																						
127	127		301									After Changyu boards the shuttle back to the South City District, Boss Wang returns to the shop.																						
128	128		301								Boss Wang	Pah, I've been crunching numbers my whole life. This might be my last bit of generosity.																						
129	129		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					With that, Boss Wang takes off the weathered plaque to the door of the shop and firmly closes the pawnshop door.

133	134		301								Broadcast	The Kowloong Chamber of Commerce is still under curfew. Please remain at home as much as possible and report any emergencies to the nearby Kowloong Crew immediately.																						
134	135		301								Broadcast	Large machinery throughout the city has been recycled. Do not panic. This situation must be handled rationally. Now, let's listen to Lord Danhao, the Bian Crew official to...																						
135	136		201							1	500230																							
136	137		301							1	Changyu	...	1																					
137	138		301									...																						
138	139		201							1	500229																							
139	140		301							1	Director	Changyu, where are you going?	1																					
140	141		201							1	500230																							
141	142		301							1	Changyu	Hehe, I'm just goin' out for a bit.	1																					
142	143		201							1	500229																							
143	144		301							1	Director	Didn't you hear the broadcast? Are you really going out with all that's happened?	1																					
144	145		201							1	500230																							
145	146		301							1	Changyu	I'm just one last step away from fixing all the props. Just wait a bit longer, Director.	1																					
146	147		201							1	500229																							
147	148		301							1	Director	How are you still thinking about the celebration at a time like this?	1																					
148	149		201							1	500230																							
149	150		301							1	Changyu	The celebration isn't what matters. I just want to get the Kowloong Theater up and running again.	1																					
150	151		201							1	500229																							
151	152		301							1	Director	Changyu!	1																					
152	153		301									Changyu quickly drags the props out of the theater and leaves the nagging director behind.																						
153	154		201							1	500230																							
154	155		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Changyu	Almost there.	1																					
155	156		202							1					1																			
156	157		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory237.png																								
157	158		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Broadcast	Up next, an emergency statement from the World Government on the Punishing Virus.																						
158	159		301								Broadcast	We face an unprecedented disaster in human history. The Science Council has launched a comprehensive investigation, and the Star of Life is actively seeking a cure.																						
159	160		301									Throughout the streets, the World Government's updates on the Punishing Virus is being broadcasted in real-time. The once prosperous KCC is now long gone. Only a few pedestrians are watching the broadcast on the street.																						
160	161		301									The broadcast echoes throughout Kowloong. Changyu quickly shuttles between the road with the props in hand.																						
161	162		201							1	500230																							
162	163		301							1	Changyu	Made it.	1																					
163	164		301								Changyu	What! It's closed...	1																					
164	165		301									Changyu starts to grow flustered at the sight of the locked repair shop.																						
165	166		301								Changyu	What should I do now? It was open yesterday.	1																					
166	167		301								Changyu	Damn it! There aren't any shops nearby that can repair our old equipment.	1																					
167	168		301								Gangster A	Hey, punk. Today's our lucky day.																						
168	169		204							1	5																							
169	170		301								Changyu	You guys again?	1																					
170	171		301								Changyu	Who are you calling a punk?	1																					
171	172		301								Changyu	Leave me alone. I'm not in the mood for this right now.	1																					
172	173		301								Gangster A	What are you sayin', tough guy?!																						
173	174		301								Gangster B	Don't you know? I've got a bone to pick with you. I'm going to make you suffer today.																						
174	175		301								Gangster B	Most of the police cyborgs have been disposed of, and the Pulao Crew are busy with the plaza and the East City District. Who can save you now?																						
175	176		301									Suddenly, the deafening sound of a broadcast plays in the distance, cutting through the air.																						
176	177		301								Changyu	**** you. I don't need anyone's help to take care of you guys.	1																					
177	178		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Changyu	Don't you wanna fight? Bring it!	1
