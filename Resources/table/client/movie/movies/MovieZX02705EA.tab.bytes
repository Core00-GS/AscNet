6	6		301									She notices a lot of graffiti on her way. Scattered randomly all over the city, they can be found on walls, shop windows, doors, and even traffic lights seven meters from the ground.																						
7	7		301									Led by an unspeakable and unignorable "familiarity," she follows the graffiti and searches.																						
8	8		301									Eventually, she stops before a mirror coated in dust.																						
9	9		301									The graffiti artist seems to have stopped before the mirror for a long time. Unlike the previous works, the one she finds here looks repeatedly revised, where layers of paint cover layers of paint.																						
10	10		301									The original layer can no longer be found, and the uppermost one is indistinguishable due to confusing overlays.																						
11	11		301									This is the only "incomplete" artwork.																						
12	12		301									Putting her hands on the graffiti, she seems to be hoping to uncover its original shape, or maybe she wants to give it the finishing touches.																						
13	13		301									But she does nothing in the end. The pale golden pond reflects the graffiti before her calmly.

26	27		301									The pond goes silent, but the strange feeling of anomaly has yet to dissipate. The more she analyzes and compares in her database, the more excessive and valueless data she accumulates.
