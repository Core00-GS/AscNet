49	24		301								Lucia	It must be said that Bianca is impressive on all accounts... yes, impressive.	1																					
50	25		301									At the rest stop, you see Lucia remarking on every passing individual, no matter if she knows them or not.																						
51	120		302								What are you up to, Lucia?	26	I think you're pretty impressive yourself, Lucia.	121																				
52	26	122	301								Lucia	I'm re-familiarizing myself with my companions, Commandant. Verifying database entries while supplementing my own impressions seems to help me understand them more.	1

54	27	28	301								Lucia	Please stop it, Commandant... I didn't mean for you to hear that.	1

59	29		301							1	Ayla	Always the busy bee, Lucia.	2																					
60	30		301									Ayla barges into the conversation with a bundle of telemetry equipment in her arms, likely returning from a surveying mission.																						
61	31		301								Lucia	Ayla, cheerful and free-spirited female Construct. Member of the World Government Association of Art. Outstanding in all respects, but occasionally out of touch.	1																					
62	125		302								You can't be reviewing people to their face, Lucia.	32	I think she's in touch most of the time.	33																				
63	32	126	301								Ayla	No matter. Artists are used to brushing off critique. Occupational hazard, I'm afraid.	2																					
64	33	126	301								Ayla	So I'm just a dumb, wide-eyed girl to the two of you... Oh, how you wound me!	2																					
65	126		204							2	1																							
66	34		301								Ayla	"Out of touch", is it? That's not what you used to call me, Lucia dear...	2																					
67	35		301								Lucia	What I used to call you... I can't seem to pull up the rest of the file. It could be fragmented.	1																					
68	36		301									After another round of searching, Lucia's expression turns apologetic.																						
69	37		301								Lucia	I'm sorry, Ayla, but I can't seem to recall. Could you tell me the name I used to call you by?	1																					
70	38		301								Ayla	"Bae-la", of course.	2																					
71	39		301								Lucia	Bae... la?	1																					
72	9226		401							1	205																							
73	40		301								Ayla	That's right. Just like that. Bae—la—	2																					
74	41		301									As the pet name leaves her lips, Ayla dives your way and buries her face in the crook of your arm, nuzzling you.																						
75	42		301									Gradually, your senses awaken to the unbearable softness of being.																						
76	127		302								Wait!	43	Lucia never called you that!	44																				
77	43	45	301								Ayla	Resistance is futile, Commandant! I'm just demonstrating for Lucia dear!	2																					
78	44	45	301								Ayla	Of course she did! Didn't Lucia use to call you her "boo"?	2																					
79	45		301									With the mischief in her eyes, it wasn't hard to figure out what Ayla was up to. Lucia, however, finds the thought hard to stomach.																						
80	128		204							1	6																							
81	46		301								Lucia	What...? The old me was someone who went around calling people weird names...? And doing such indescribable things to Commandant...?	1																					
82	47		301								Lucia	No... that's impossible. Don't be fooled, Lucia...	1																					
83	48		301								Lucia	...At any rate!	1																					
84	129		204							1	5																							
85	49		301									In the span of a moment, Lucia steels herself and wrenches Ayla away from you.																						
86	50		301								Lucia	Commandant, while I cannot verify what Ayla has said, please refrain from overt physical contact with others in public spaces.	1																					
87	51		301								Lucia	For your safety, of course... Right!	1

92	53		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Ayla	I was just trying a harmless prank on dear Lucia, but now... My, my, Commandant, seems like you're in troubled waters...	2
