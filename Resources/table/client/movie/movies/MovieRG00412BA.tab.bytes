5	5		301							1	Rosetta	How is everyone? We're used to venturing on long journeys like this one, but this might not be the case for you and the others.	1																					
6	6		302								It's okay. I'm also used to it.	7																						
7	7		301								Staessen	I may have gotten older, but when I was younger, I could march on the snowfield for eight straight days and nights.	2																					
8	8		301								Staessen	A short walk like this is nothing for these ol' bones.	2																					
9	9		301								Rosetta	If that's the case, let's quicken our pace.	1																					
10	10		301								Rosetta	If we can get there before nightfall, you all might even get to have a glass of freshly brewed kvass in Kyaranta.	1

12	12		301							1	Lucia	Kvass?	2																					
13	13		301								Rosetta	It's a traditional drink they managed to recreate. The people there drink it more than water.	1																					
14	14		302								If that's the case, let's get moving!	15

17	17		301							1	Liv	If we get there before nightfall, we won't need to camp out on the snowfield. It's better for your health that way too, Commandant.	2
