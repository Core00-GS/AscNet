5	5		301									Pulao manages to calm the "pandas" down. After they leave, the tour guide collapses to the ground. His suit has dirt on it, but he does not have time to clean it.

11	11		301								Terminal	Hey! What's wrong with you?! Why are you at some random stupid place again?!																						
12	12		202							1					1																			
13	13		301									The guide is about to take Pulao's handkerchief, but his terminal suddenly starts to talk, shocking him greatly.																						
14	14		301									His hands are juggling like a circus performer. Finally, he manages to catch the handkerchief before it drops to the ground.																						
15	15		201							1	500454																							
16	16		301							1	Tour Guide	Phew...	1																					
17	17		301									He wipes some cold sweat off his forehead and takes out the terminal.																						
18	18		301								Terminal	You really are a genius.																						
19	19		301								Terminal	As a tour guide, the last thing you do is take the client the wrong way. Across the entire company, our team is the only one that always gets a C in the KPI, and you are the reason why.																						
20	20		301								Terminal	You are a disgrace!																						
21	21		301								Tour Guide	But our KPI plummeted because you used the funds elsewhere...	1																					
22	22		301								Terminal	What?																						
23	23		301								Tour Guide	No, nothing. You are right, leader. It's all my fault. I promise I'll correct my mistake.	1																					
24	24		301									The terminal's video function is not enabled, but the tour guide is still bowing and nodding as he holds it.																						
25	25		301								Terminal	I don't care about your promise. You say the same thing every time, but never fail to disappoint me.																						
26	26		301								Terminal	You don't have to come tomorrow.																						
27	27		301								Tour Guide	Please, don't!	1																					
28	28		301								Tour Guide	I'm the only breadwinner in the family. I can't get fired... My kid needs to go to school, and I have a loan to pay...	1																					
29	29		301								Terminal	As if I care.																						
30	30		301								Tour Guide	Please, give me one more chance, leader. Look at my age. I'll never be able to find another job...	1																					
31	31		301								Terminal	You want a chance? Who's going to give me a chance?																						
32	32		301								Terminal	You've been in the industry for over ten years. Still, you take the clients to the wrong way multiple times every month. I'm losing all my hair handling their complaints.																						
33	33		301								Terminal	Did you give my hair a chance?																						
34	34		201							1	500445																							
35	35		301							1	Pulao	...	1																					
36	36		301								Pulao	Um... Can I say something?	1																					
37	37		301								Terminal	No problem. My honored client, I have already punished his mistake. Please don't file another complaint...																						
38	38		204							1	6																							
39	39		301								Pulao	Oh, no, I'm not "honored" at all. Besides, I never said I wanted to complain.	1																					
40	40		401							1	207																							
41	41		301								Pulao	Actually, I asked him to take me here.	1																					
42	42		201							1	500454																							
43	43		301							1	Tour Guide & Terminal	Huh?	1																					
44	44		301									The guide wants to say something, but Pulao makes a "shh" gesture. He covers his mouth and continues to listen to their conversation.																						
45	45		301								Terminal	Are you saying that he didn't take you to the wrong way this time?																						
46	46		201							1	500445	6																						
47	47		301							1	Pulao	He didn't. Actually, Mr. Guide showed me lots of great views along the way, many of which I have never seen in the town! I saw rushing streams, steep valleys and dense jungles. They are so beautiful!	1																					
48	48		204							1	2																							
49	49		301								Pulao	Mr. Guide did his job and went above and beyond. Instead of criticizing him, you should give him well-deserved praise.	1																					
50	50		301								Pulao	I'd like to give him a five-star rating!	1																					
51	51		301								Terminal	Um...																						
52	52		301								Terminal	Fine, if the client says so, I can let you walk this time.																						
53	53		201							1	500454																							
54	54		301							1	Tour Guide	Thank you so much...	1																					
55	55		301									The tour guide keeps thanking his leader until the conversation is hung up. After quite a while, he finally stands up and returns Pulao's handkerchief with both hands.																						
56	56		301								Tour Guide	Much appreciated. I don't know what I would do without you.	1

59	59		301							1	Pulao	Hehe, you are welcome.	2																					
60	60		301								Tour Guide	Sorry... I didn't take you to the Big Fish after all.	1																					
61	61		301								Pulao	Don't worry. One of my friends used to say, "keep asking and you'll find your way." We just need to ask around.	2																					
62	62		301								Tour Guide	That's true... Oh, it's getting late.	1																					
63	63		301								Pulao	You should go pick up your kid. You have already helped me to get out of the most dangerous area. I can walk the rest on my own.	2																					
64	64		301								Tour Guide	Um...	1																					
65	65		202							1	2				1																			
66	66		301									The tour guide opens his mouth but nothing comes out. When Pulao packs her bag and waves her hand to say goodbye, he suddenly stops her.

69	69		301							1	Tour Guide	Wait a sec, girl.	1																					
70	70		301								Tour Guide	You said you were looking for Big Fish's tears. But you don't have any containers with you.	1																					
71	71		204							2	6																							
72	72		301								Pulao	You're right!	2																					
73	73		301								Pulao	I left in a rush and completely forgot about it.	2																					
74	74		301									The tour guide takes out a pink water bottle with lovely bunny stickers on it.																						
75	75		301								Tour Guide	This was my daughter's old bottle. When she grew up, she thought it was too childish and no longer used it.	1																					
76	76		301								Tour Guide	It's just the right size for Big Fish's tears.	1																					
77	77		301								Tour Guide	Just take it as a token of appreciation.	1																					
78	78		301								Pulao	C-can I?	2																					
79	79		301								Tour Guide	Of course. I'll ask my friends about the Big Fish when I go back. Once I hear something, I'll send it to your terminal.	1																					
80	80		204							2	2																							
81	81		301								Pulao	Wow! Thanks, Mr. Guide!	2																					
82	82		301								Tour Guide	Don't thank me. This is nothing compared to how much you have helped me to keep my job.	1																					
83	83		204							2																								
84	84		301								Pulao	Your job is really important to you, it seems.	2																					
85	85		301								Tour Guide	Of course. It means the world to someone my age.	1																					
86	86		301								Pulao	Have you ever thought about changing to another job, or starting your own business?	2																					
87	87		301								Tour Guide	I can't. Once you grow old, finding a job gets very difficult.	1																					
88	88		204							2	8																							
89	89		301								Pulao	But I heard many good things about running a stall.	2																					
90	90		301								Pulao	Why don't you start a shop near your daughter's school? It's less hectic, and you get to spend more time with her.	2																					
91	91		301								Tour Guide	I'm never a business person.	1																					
92	92		204							2	1																							
93	93		301								Pulao	But I think the kids will love your passion and kindness!	2																					
94	94		301								Pulao	At least you never have to worry about not having enough customers!	2																					
95	95		301								Tour Guide	Hmm... You have a point.	1																					
96	96		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Tour Guide	Thank you, I'll think about it! Hope you can find Big Fish too.	1
