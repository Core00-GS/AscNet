4	4		301							1	Lucia	Commandant, we'll have to stay overnight here for our mission. Is that alright?	1																					
5	5		302								Sure.	6	I could really use a soft, warm bed...	7																				
6	6	12	301								Lucia	Then I'll go prepare our camp with Lee and Liv.	1																					
7	7		301								Lucia	It's been a few days of long travels, hasn't it? I can't provide a mattress, but maybe you can rest more comfortably if you rest your head on my legs...	1

14	14		301							1	Liv	But it really has gotten colder. Isn't today Christmas Eve?	2																					
15	15		301									As you talk, Liv looks up at the night sky from your empty, quiet campsite, slightly saddened.																						
16	16		301								Liv	I thought that this Christmas would be the one where everyone can get together, but...	2																					
17	17		301								Lucia	The situation has gotten more critical after all, and everyone has been sent on their respective mission. We wouldn't have time to celebrate even if we wanted to.	1																					
18	18		302								I'm sorry about it as well.	19	I'm sure we'll get together next time.	20																				
19	19	21	301								Liv	Our mission continues regardless... I was just lamenting, Commandant. Let's carry on tomorrow.	2																					
20	20		301								Lucia	Commandant is right. If we put in more effort, we'll be able to meet again in the future.	1																					
21	21		201							2	500026		400																					
22	22		301								Lee	Perhaps we don't have to wait to see what the future holds.	2																					
23	23		301								Lucia	Lee?	1																					
24	24		301									As he speaks, Lee reveals a crafty smile and a projector in his hand.																						
25	25		302								What's that?	26																						
26	26		301								Lee	This is the Christmas gift I've prepared for Commandant, Lucia, Liv, and myself.	2																					
27	27		301								Lucia	A Christmas gift... When did you prepare it?	1																					
28	28		301								Lee	About a week ago. None of you said anything, but I've got a feeling that you've all been looking forward to Christmas. Especially you, Commandant.	2																					
29	29		302								No, I'm not!	30	I've been looking forward to it!	31																				
30	30	32	301								Lee	Sure, if you say so.	2																					
31	31		301								Lee	Then, at least I know this is worth the effort I spent.	2																					
32	32		301								Lucia	What is the present?	1																					
33	33		301								Lee	It's "everyone."	2																					
34	34		201							2	1031001	6	400																					
35	35		301								Liv	...Everyone?	2																					
36	36		202							1	2				1																			
37	37		301									Neither Lucia nor Liv understands what Lee is saying, and he does not bother explaining either. He just goes ahead and connects his Entropy frame with the satellites.																						
38	38		301									And then, he directs the information feed from the satellites to the projector.

45	45		301								Chrome	Wait—did you hear a word I just said?	2																					
46	46		301									Kamui and Chrome suddenly appear in the projection. You can see Kamui sticking his face right in front of the monitor, with Chrome trying to drag him away.																						
47	47		301								Chrome	Why are you covering the whole screen?	2																					
48	48		301								Kamui	I'm just making sure this thing's running. Hey, Gray Raven, can you hear me?	1																					
49	49		301								Chrome	I told you this isn't a live video call—wait... It's recording already! Kamui, say something!	2																					
50	50		301								Kamui	You're the captain, Chrome. I really should let you speak first.	1																					
51	51		301								Chrome	So now you're treating me like a captain?	2																					
52	52		301									Although he looks a little tired, Chrome still promptly strengthens his posture and adjusts his tone before turning to face the camera.

54	53		301								Chrome	I'm Chrome, the leader of Strike Hawk.	2																					
55	54		301								Chrome	I don't know what mission you are currently performing, nor do I know if it's going well. But if you manage to find the time on Christmas Eve to view this message...	2																					
56	55		301								Chrome	I suppose that means everything is going according to plan on your end. So is our task here, obviously.	2																					
57	56		301								Chrome	A lot has happened, but I'm glad that we're still alive, still fighting tenaciously for our dream.	2																					
58	57		301								Kamui	Capt, are you going to be this polite the whole time?	1																					
59	853		204							2																								
60	58		301								Chrome	Being respectful is a basic manner, Kamui... How else would you do it?	2

62	60		204							1	2																							
63	61		301								Kamui	Hey there, Gray Raven! Merry Christmas! We can't see each other this time, but I've prepared a great Christmas gift for y'all!	1																					
64	62		301								Kamui	We should get everyone together when you're back in Babylonia, and we'll do a gift exchange then! Just so you know, I want the newest video game console!	1																					
65	63		301								Chrome	...Sigh, what else was I expecting? Alright, this device isn't going to run any longer.	2																					
66	854		204							2	1																							
67	64		301								Chrome	I'll also prepare a present for you, Gray Raven. Let's finish our missions first, and I'll see you in Babylonia.	2

77	74		301							1	Lee	Of course. I did say my present is "everyone."	1																					
78	75		301								Lee	I sent out a mail before this operation, asking everyone who received it to record a word or two.	1																					
79	76	79	301								Lee	Well, let's keep playing.	1

87	85		301								Watanabe	As you can probably tell, I'm in one of the Forsaken hideouts currently. Because of its geographical location, it's still scorching hot here in December.	1																					
88	86		301								Watanabe	So nothing too festive is happening with us. Although I did just receive this bunch of flowers from some kids, who said it's an early Christmas gift.	1

248	246		302								In the end, President Hassen...																							
249	247		301								Lee	A little tragic, I agree. But I guess the President isn't someone who would mind.	1

251	249		301							1	Lucia	What to say... I wasn't expecting you to prepare such a special gift, Lee.	1																					
252	250		201							1	500026																							
253	251		301							1	Lee	As a member of this squad, I just wanted to do something for everyone here.	1																					
254	252		301								Lee	And just like how Liv has always wanted to celebrate Christmas, it's also something I've always wanted to do.	1

256	254		301							1	Liv	Is this a dream of yours?	1

258	256		301							1	Lee	Not really a dream. Just a nice thought.	1																					
259	257		301								Lee	I've forgotten the name of the book, but when I was studying, I read a line that goes like this:	1																					
260	258		301								Lee	"Do not fear, for all spirits converge in the sky, and we... We are all connected."	1																					
261	259		301								Lee	I was just trying to continue that idea.	1																					
262	260		301								Lee	I sent out the mail, so everyone who had to stay apart could record a message—	1																					
263	261		301								Lee	All their thoughts and wishes would be channeled through the satellites, crossing time and space, and we would meet here today.	1																					
264	262		301								Lee	I think... it's a romantic idea.	1																					
265	263		302								I think so too.	264	Thank you, Lee.	265																				
266	264	268	301								Lee	It seems that Commandant would also enjoy that book. I'll find it for you when we're back.	1																					
267	265		204							1	6																							
268	266		301								Lee	...Say that behind my back next time. I'm still not used to it.	1

270	268		301									After Lee's confession, everyone looks up at the night sky and finds countless stars blinking. You are all looking for the satellites that carry the "spirits."																						
271	269		301									And you all point them out, the sparks you believe you have connected.																						
272	270		301									You know there is no way to be certain, but you still reach out and look toward that shining light.
