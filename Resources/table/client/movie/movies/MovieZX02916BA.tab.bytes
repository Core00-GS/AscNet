468	468		301								Cargo Member Jimmy	It hurts... it hurts so much...	1																					
469	469		301									The wounded Jimmy, still a teenager at this point, is trembling. His tears briefly wash away the bloodstains, revealing his still-adolescent face.																						
470	470		301									But he crawls up despite the pain and raises his pistol even as he cries‚Äîhurt and broken as he is, he refuses to kneel and instead fires at the blinding light.																						
471	471		401							2	1510																							
472	472		301								Cargo Member Jimmy	Aaaargh... you... you people...	1																					
473	473		401							2	1510																							
474	474		301									He can barely see the enemy against the light‚Äîhe can barely hold his gun as it is. But the ricocheting bullets still frighten the cowardly guards, forcing them to put him down. That is the last thing Jimmy can do.

484	484		301								Bumblebee Member Mike	What should we do now... We don't stand a chance confronting them directly.	2																					
485	485		301								Cargo Captain Niino	Staying here won't save us anyway. Let's head out and go down fighting!	1

487	487		301							1	Cargo Captain Shauna	It isn't time for our last stand yet... Check that out.	1																					
488	488		301									Shauna points to where Carriage G broke off. The guards are standing near the pneumatics‚Äîdevices Asslam used to open the train doors during an emergency before the train shifts to Helium-3 as their energy source.																						
489	489		301								Cargo Captain Shauna	There is a large amount of heated compressed air inside. I learned about it from the people in Maintenance in the past... If we can get it to leak, it will distract them for a good while.	1																					
490	490		201							2	500093	9	-400																					
491	491		301							1	Cargo Captain Niino	We can take the opportunity to split up and hide, ambushing them from the dark... Do we still have any explosives? Grenades? Anything...?	2

498	498		301								Cargo Captain Niino	No way...	2																					
499	499		301								Cargo Captain Shauna	If you can all open fire at the same time and cover me for five seconds... no‚Äîthree. Three seconds is all I need to get to that track behind covers.	1																					
500	500		301								Cargo Captain Niino	I said no! How's that different from taking your own life? You were just lecturing me!	2																					
501	501		301								Cargo Captain Shauna	How are they the same... That's the only way out now. Didn't Rachel say that you have to listen to me if we disagree on something?	1

510	510		301								Cargo Captain Shauna	No time to hesitate. I'm going to count to three, and you start firing for at least three seconds! Split up once their formation is disrupted, understood?	1

512	512		301							1	Noan	Is there no other way?	2

514	514		301								Cargo Captain Shauna	No, there is no other way.	1																					
515	515		301								Cargo Captain Shauna	Don't be afraid. As long as there are those who live‚Äîas long as the people we want to protect get to live‚ÄîI have made the right choice.	1																					
516	516		301								Cargo Captain Shauna	By the way, Niino... that thing you mentioned last week. My answer is yes. Let's move in together after this.	1																					
517	517		201							2	500093	9	-400																					
518	518		301							1	Cargo Captain Niino	What?! You're talking about that now?!	2

523	523		301								Cargo Captain Shauna	‚ÄîThree!	1																					
524	524		301									She knows clearly that her life is no longer hers after these three seconds as she offers it to the Grim Reaper.																						
525	525		301								Cargo Captain Shauna	‚ÄîTwo!	1																					
526	526		301									Grinding his teeth, Niino curses under his breath as his rifle aims at exactly where he needs to fire.																						
527	527		301								Cargo Captain Shauna	‚ÄîOne!	1																					
528	528		301									Shauna never stops thinking about dying. She is used to seeing her people die. She thought she would be ready when her time came, but now, taking one last look at her comrades, she allows herself a moment of vulnerability.

538	538		301									Shouts and gunshots come from behind the Cargo Crew's covers, sending the surrounding guards into disarray. Unable to see where they are firing from, the guards are forced to find cover as well.																						
539	539		301									An eagle-eyed guard notices a figure dashing out a cover, but the Cargo Crew's suppressive fire causes the guard's shot to go wild.																						
540	540		201							1	500093	9																						
541	541		301							1	Cargo Captain Niino	Keep shooting! Don't stop!	1

547	547		301									The Cargo Crew is out of ammo to sustain their suppression after three seconds. The brief pause is quickly assumed by the return fire of the guards, which pins down the remaining crew members instead.																						
548	548		202							1					1																			
549	549		301									But before long, the guards start screaming as steaming gas bursts from the door, breaking up their formation.

570	570		301									First, a bullet breaks the lamp on the ceiling, enshrouding the depths of the carriage once again. Not only does it make it harder for the guards to find them, but the sunlight also turns the guards into shining targets.																						
571	571		301									Then comes a volley of gunshots. The head of a guard who has veered off tracking them explodes; another guard who is hiding behind a cover finds himself somehow riddled with bullet holes...																						
572	572		301									The guards are getting impatient, seeing other guards dropping one by one, and decide to bring down everything that can be used as a cover; after a round of explosions, the Cargo Crew stops firing.

585	585		301								Noan	Niino! What do you think you're doing?	1																					
586	586		301									The fire caused by the explosives the guards deployed is beginning to spread. The area with the pneumatics is flooded with fire‚Äîit will not be long before the whole place burns to ashes.

590	590		301									Before Noan can stop him, Niino is already on his way to the corner of the carriage, crouching and dashing from cover to cover right underneath the watchful gaze of the guards.																						
591	591		301									He quickly reaches Shauna. For a second, Niino even thinks Shauna might be alive before he sees her body with his own eyes.																						
592	592		301			RImgBg1Shake						But before he can move Shauna's body to a safe location, he feels a sudden excruciating pain from one of his feet‚Äîhis left foot has stepped on a bear trap hidden among the debris.																						
593	593		301									His years of training have kept him from screaming despite the bone-shattering pain, but the sound of the trap activating is loud enough to get the attention of the alerted guards.																						
594	594		401							2	10001004																							
595	595		301			RImgBg1Shake						A hailstorm of bullets fires toward where Niino is. He immediately ducks away, but not before he is hit twice on his abdomen.																						
596	596		301									Niino remembers every trap in this place, and he would not have made such a rookie mistake. It must have been moved‚Äîthe guards must have moved it near the corpses in order to catch anyone coming back for them.

617	617		301									Taking advantage of this window of opportunity, Noan slices toward Niino and drags him away from the shooting and the spreading fire‚Äîleaving Shauna's body behind in the process, watching as the flame devours her.																						
618	618		301									Retreating behind a secured cover, they have nonetheless exposed their location. Suppressive fire rains upon them, trapping them where they are.

684	684		301								Upper-Level Guard	Not bad... Walk here slowly, just like this. Don't try to pull any stunts.	3																					
685	685		301									The guard gently smacks the face of the child kneeling beside him with his pistol. The child is so scared that he cannot even cry.

695	695		301									"They might be silent, but that doesn't mean they approve of what's happening."																						
696	696		301									Many on the lower level disagree with Rachel. They believe those who do not fight are a waste of resources, but they forget that people like Hill have been contributing in their own way inside this moving cage.																						
697	697		301									How many children has Hill looked after? How many torn clothes has she fixed?																						
698	698		301									Noan never questions his choices because he has noticed it all.																						
699	699		301									The people he has to protect are right there beside him. They are safe, even though they are scared... He does not regret what he has done. He just wishes he was powerful enough to have done more.
