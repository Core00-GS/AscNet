6	4		301									The processed electronic sound from a small machine on the ground echoes in the cramped carriage.																						
7	5		301									"Well, here's your pay for the information... I guess we should call this a deal?"																						
8	6		301									"Anyway, I brought what you wanted from that 'ship.'"																						
9	7		301									"It's not easy to slip under the Gray Ravens... Fortunately, this intel isn't exactly top secret."																						
10	8		301									"As for the machine, it's essentially the same thing as the virtual training simulator in Babylonia."																						
11	9		301									"I modified the program to input memory data as battle records. Just use the program in the attachment to enter your M.I.N.D. via simulated combat to commence extraction."																						
12	10		301									"Due to the large amount of data, when you connect for the first time, your M.I.N.D. will be temporarily 'emptied' to make room for the carrier program. I recommend you find a place to lie down before connecting."

36	35		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						In the metropolis of the Kowloong Chamber of Commerce, there is a corner surrounded by courtyards and old streets...																						
37	36		301									Where such a theater exists...																						
38	37		301									It is lofty and grandiose. It is old and dilapidated.																						
39	38		301									The wide stage once allowed for fifty martial artists to perform stunts simultaneously. Giant props as tall as the curtain could be pushed onto the stage without hindrance.																						
40	39		301									But now, it has fallen into disuse. Of the ten dozen seats, now only seventy patched-up chairs are left collecting dust.																						
41	40		301									Of the three large theater troupes, now only a few members remain.																						
42	41		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					After all, who would be willing to sit and watch a performance, when holographic videos and realistic simulations exist?																						
43	43		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory233.png																								
44	44		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The feeble director sits on the shaky rocking chair at the gate of the theater, with a pang of despair swathed over his heart.																						
45	45		301									He had ordered Laoyu to move the rocking chair here. Laoyu is the only custodian left in the entire theater.																						
46	46		301									The quiet, brawny man's life is a checkerboard of carpentry and baijiu. But despite his monogamic commitment to the craft, his skill is an unimpressive something. No one ever bothered to poach him for woodworking.																						
47	47		301									And so, much like Yusheng, he stayed here. Not like there were any reasons to leave the theater.																						
48	48		301									For Yusheng, however... He must have inherited his prima donna of a mother's pride. In his eyes, nothing held more importance than the stage.																						
49	49		301									—Alas, the theater has long since fallen out of favor. I should just find a good day and end it on a good note...																						
50	50		301									Half-leaning against the shaky rocking chair and sipping tea, the director could not help the thought from sifting into his mind.																						
51	51		301									But even when indulging in the glorious memories of the past, the director's mind is as keen as ever. He adeptly slings his cup and hits a figure sneaking out of the theater.																						
52	52		301									The figure turns his head in pain, then intercepts the falling cup with an almost inhuman agility.																						
53	53		201							1	500230	5																						
54	54		301							1	???	Are you crazy, old man! This teacup is from the Song Dynasty, probably! Do you know how much I went through to buy this in the East City District? It's one of a kind!	1																					
55	55		201							1	500229																							
56	56		301							1	Director	Where do you think you're off to?	1																					
57	57		201							1	500230	5																						
58	58		301							1	???	...Mind your own business!	1																					
59	59		201							1	500229																							
60	60		301							1	Director	How many times have I told you, Changyu...	1																					
61	61		301									Changyu continues to walk and talk, as if he has heard the director nag him a thousand times.																						
62	62		201							1	500230																							
63	63		301							1	Changyu	I got it. I got it. I've got somewhere important to be! I'll be back before dinner!	1																					
64	64		202							1					1																			
65	65		301									Without waiting for him to finish, Changyu hops up onto the wall of the courtyard and escapes, leaving only the old man's disapproving shouts behind.																						
66	66		201							1	500229																							
67	67		301							1	Director	Don't try your funny stuff on the Pulao crew!	1																					
68	68		301									The director continues, but only the gentle breeze is there to listen.																						
69	69		301								Director	Sigh... After this tea break, I'll have to go apologize door to door again... This is really working my old bones to the ground.	1																					
70	70		301									Just as the director prepares to take another sip, another troublesome one shows up in front of him.																						
71	71		301								Laoyu	The p-people from our food supplier and the w-wood shop just came over and knocked on the side door and said... N-no more delaying with the food money, and r-repairs, a-and lumber.																						
72	72		301								Director	What about our regular... Any news?	1																					
73	73		301								Laoyu	No... S-she said her husband is getting old. N-no more loud noises. So they h-hired a VR company for a Hawaiian birthday.																						
74	74		301								Director	Alright. Well, off you go then.	1																					
75	75		301									Laoyu quietly turns and goes back to the theater.																						
76	76		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Director	They're still kind enough to collect debts in private... But—sigh... How long can we handle this...	1

78	78		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory237.png																								
79	79		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Away from the theater, Changyu joins a bustling crowd.																						
80	80		301									People come and go in a hurry; unbecoming looks adorn their faces. Deafening music roars overhead.																						
81	81		301									Naturally, Changyu has his reasons for coming here.																						
82	82		201							1	500230																							
83	83		301							1	Changyu	Business at the theater continues to worsen. The theater hadn't even opened its doors this month.	1																					
84	84		301								Changyu	Old man's all against violating the regulations from the police bots, thinking it'd sully the theater's image... But if we can't even feed ourselves, what's the point of caring about the image?	1																					
85	85		301								Changyu	And he keeps going off about how "if people and machines tolerate each other, society will become more peaceful..." Machines don't care if you got no food in your mouth, man.	1																					
86	86		202							1					1																			
87	87		301									Changyu leans against the wall, looking at the crowd on the street. Bored, he takes out a polished coin from his pocket and flips it into the air.																						
88	88		301									He then jumps up and catches the coin with acrobatic finesse.																						
89	89		301									The move attracts the attention of some bystanders, who then surround Changyu as if prepared to watch a street performance.																						
90	90		301									Thinking that this might be an opportunity to attract customers, Changyu performs another backflip. He reaches behind, about to hand out flyers from his backpack to the applauding crowd.																						
91	91		301									—Changyu had spent the last two nights creating flyers for this very reason. If the old director thinks that going against the regulations is beneath him, Changyu needs only take it upon himself.																						
92	92		301								Police Robot	By the authority of the Kowloong Chamber of Commerce, street performances are not permitted here. Please disperse immediately.																						
93	93		201							1	500230	21																						
94	94		301							1	Changyu	Tch... It'll be trouble if they catch me...	1																					
95	95		301									Changyu returns the flyers to his bag and jumps up to the second floor balcony. He flips up and over, escaping to another building.																						
96	96		204							1	5																							
97	97		301								Changyu	...Whatever, I'll let them do their job. At least those rust buckets keep the streets safe.	1																					
98	98		301								Changyu	If people and machines tolerate each other, society will become more peaceful... huh?	1																					
99	99		301									The boy takes a deep breath of the polluted air and fishes the flyers out of his backpack.																						
100	100		301								Changyu	But even if society's more peaceful, who'd care about the life and death of some old theater...?	1																					
101	101		301									With that, Changyu directs his gaze to another lively area off in the distance.																						
102	102		301								Changyu	I guess I'll go post these flyers up over there.	1																					
103	103		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Changyu	In this kinda world, as long as you're buying a ticket... Our doors are open to anyone.	1
