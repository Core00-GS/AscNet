39	39		301								Rachel	If you give up here and now, what would happen... to those without a home?	1

59	59		301								Rachel	That's right... he was the one who told your friend about Warehouse G54. Assad tricked him and got him inside the crate... That's why you should hate me.

336	336		301								Noan	Rachel stockpiled those weapons because she wanted equal rights for the people on the lower level. She wanted to free us from being exploited by the Blessing Boxes and an unjust system.	1																					
337	337		301								Noan	And our worst oppressor is none other than Ashlar and his people.	1																					
338	338		301								Noan	This time was no different. Not only did he use military-grade weapons he secretly owned to slaughter the Cargo Crew, but he also sent his guards to come after the citizens in the damaged carriage.	1																					
339	339		301								Noan	Everyone standing back there can testify to that.	1

344	344		301								Ashlar	It seems that our little witness here has been coaxed into telling lies.	1																					
345	345		301								Ashlar	My fellow aristocrats. Do you remember why we funded Asslam all those years ago?	1																					
346	346		301								Ashlar	Love and hope. That's right. We did it because we wanted to spread love and hope around the world. Did what the Cargo Crew do align with our intention, then? Of course it didn't.	1																					
347	347		301								Ashlar	We all have to work hard in order to reclaim Earth and rebuild the glorious Golden Age. How shameful and selfish is it to destroy Asslam just because some of them are tired?	1

358	358		301								Noan	That will be enough to prove what you have done! That will show everyone who the real oppressor is and who has been trying to assassinate the aristocrats who wouldn't take your orders!	1																					
359	359		301								Ashlar	That's you, obviously.	2																					
360	360		301								Noan	—What?!	1																					
361	361		301								Ashlar	You're Julie's boy, aren't you? Your father used to work for me.	2																					
362	362		301								Ashlar	We still have records of his crime, I believe. Rachel killed him in revenge before we could give him his sentence.	2																					
363	363		301									Ashlar causes a commotion among the crowd again.																						
364	364		301								Ashlar	Your mother never stopped holding a grudge. She helped Rachel to manipulate the books and misappropriated supplies. We have all of them on record.	2																					
365	365		301								Ashlar	To avenge your parents, you stayed by Rachel's side all these years so as to steer her to start her riot at the wrong time and take the chance to kill her yourself!	2																					
366	366		301								Aristocrat 1	The whole thing was in-fighting inside the Cargo Crew?																						
367	367		301								Aristocrat 2	What else can those commoners do except for taking up our space and causing trouble?																						
368	368		301								Aristocrat 3	They're all the same! Uneducated and vulgar! Violence is all they know!																						
369	369		301								Aristocrat's Lackey 1	Hear! Hear!																						
370	370		301								Aristocrat's Lackey 2	How horrible! Absolutely horrible!																						
371	371		301									The aristocrats all rise to support Ashlar even when he has just spun a brand new narrative out of thin air to shift all the blames onto Noan.

375	375		301								Aristocrat 1	Get these criminals out of here!																						
376	376		301								Aristocrat 2	Make the train safe again!																						
377	377		301								Ashlar	Have you heard of the tale "Calling a Deer a Horse"?	2																					
378	378		301									Ashlar walks toward Noan nonchalantly, quietly teasing the young man.																						
379	379		301								Ashlar	A chancellor wanted to overthrow the king, but he didn't know how much sway he had in the court. So, before he acted, he gifted his king a deer while claiming it to be a horse.	2																					
380	380		301								Ashlar	The king didn't believe him, obviously. So the chancellor asked the other officials in the court, "Is this a deer or a horse?" And how do you think they answered?	2																					
381	381		301								Ashlar	So many couldn't wait to agree with the chancellor that it was indeed a horse.	2																					
382	382		301								Ashlar	You thought those who mistake a deer for a horse are stupid, but that's their cleverest trick. People who tell the truth... are often the first to die.	2																					
383	383		301								Noan	...	1																					
384	384		301								Ashlar	We have guests from Babylonia with us today, so I prefer not to make a scene. This is your last chance to hand in the terminal.	2

395	395		301							1	Noan	"Reasonable"...?!	1																					
396	396		301									Noan looks at Jamilah. She has not spoken after her initial speech. Lowering her head, she only whispers to the people beside her quietly as if the other figures behind her are a threat.																						
397	397		301									Noan turns to look at the unnamed Construct and Aston. Neither of them is able to answer Noan's helpless gaze as the crowd around them becomes more and more alarming.																						
398	398		301									Standing amidst this insurmountable tide, Noan finally accepts that the law and order of the Golden Age have utterly collapsed.																						
399	399		301									In this apocalypse, only the "leader" who holds actual power can make the rules that others follow. Ordinary people will not light up the night, as bright as they might burn.

427	427		301									—Is that because they worry they will otherwise become the next targets?																						
428	428		301									The guards surround the young Construct while the crowd chants. They cannot take the evidence away from the Construct, and the Construct cannot fight them off due to Jamilah's stance.

437	437		301								Noan	...?																						
438	438		301									The terminal shatters, its pieces scattered on the floor, stepped over by the disorderly crowd.

443	443		301									He reaches out with his trembling hand, hoping to hold onto some of the shattered fragments, but the crowd steps on his fingers just as they did the broken device.																						
444	444		301								Noan	Give it back...!																						
445	445		301									The excruciating pain in his chest torments his soul.
