5	5		301							1	Ayla	My piece won't be displayed here until later, but we can at least look at others' artwork and get hyped for the event.	1																					
6	6		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Ayla	Commandant, let go on in.	1																					
7	7		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Ayla	Commandant, have you heard about the life of Eugene Nakahara?	1																					
8	8		301								Ayla	Look! It's Lina Ono's "Magenta Wave"!	1

10	10		301									After taking a big lap around the exhibition hall, Ayla is now filled with excitement...																						
11	11		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Full of energy at a time like this, no one would have guessed that she works late into the night...																						
12	12		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						...																						
13	13		301									Ayla stops in front of a picture titled "Early Spring".																						
14	14		301									She seems full of regret... but why?																						
15	15		302								What is it?	16

17	17		301							1	Ayla	Hey...	1																					
18	18		301								Ayla	This paint... is an old piece of mine. Maybe it's here as a replacement for the original exhibit.	1																					
19	19		301								Ayla	It's not my best work... It's too constrained and pays too much attention on expressing "objective existence."	1																					
20	20		301								Ayla	But looking at it now... it seems as if this is a reminder not to be constrained to such a simple "form"...	1																					
21	21		301								Ayla	...	1

26	26		301							1	Ayla	Sorry for making you be with me all day.	1																					
27	27		302								No worries.	28																						
28	28		301								Ayla	So... How did you know that the question mark could be filled in?	1																					
29	29		302								Um...	30																						
30	30		301								Ayla	Regardless of how you did it...	1																					
31	31		302								?	32																						
32	32		301								Ayla	I think I got some inspiration.	1																					
33	33		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Ayla	Think I can trouble you for a bit tomorrow?	1
