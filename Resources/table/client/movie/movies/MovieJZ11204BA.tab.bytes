5	4		301								???	Is your name... Chrome?																						
6	6		301								???	You have perfect Tantalum-193 heteropolymer adaptability and beautiful biological readings. Looks like we have a high chance of success.																						
7	7		301								???	Judging from what you look like‚Äîah, no, I'm just curious, don't be nervous. This is a private refitting request, right?																						
8	8		301								???	You don't look like someone who has no other choice.																						
9	9		301								???	A lucky guy from Eden... Young, healthy, well-dressed. You're the first refit volunteer I've got "here".																						
10	10		301								???	You should know enough about military Constructs.																						
11	11		301								Langston	I do.	1																					
12	12		301								???	Oh, right. The refitting project agreement form... The benefactor has been filled in too.																						
13	13		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				???	Good, no problem then. Let's begin.

16	17		301								???	Doesn't it hurt?																						
17	18		301								???	Astounding pain tolerance threshold.																						
18	19		301								???	Due to certain constraints, when operating on Constructs, we cannot perform general anesthesia. The screams can get maddening sometimes.

20	21		301								???	Stunning memory scars... What are you hiding?																						
21	22		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				???	Consciousness damage... that's a plus for me. Hmm... specialized refitting... I just had a flash of inspiration.

24	24		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Langston finds himself in an unfamiliar space. All he can hear is the conversation between doctors and their assistants.																						
25	25		301									It feels like an out-of-body experience. He is looking down on himself in the air‚Äîthe body is merchandise. A test subject. A perfect fragment. An incomplete Construct.																						
26	26		301									"A mixture: A material made up of two or more different Chemical substances which are not chemically combined."																						
27	27		301									"A concrete object made of materials and information, whose borders are continuously constructed and reconstructed."																						
28	28		301									That's what it says on the book he's not allowed to read.																						
29	29		301								???	...You need to figure out what you really are.																						
30	30		301								???	Adaptability is not the main point of a Construct.																						
31	31		301								???	Once the shell called the body is abandoned, what does the human leave behind? That's what you should focus on.																						
32	32		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				???	Who are you exactly? And who do you want to become?
