11	11		301									...																						
12	12		301									Just as Roland expected, a few Corrupted show up behind their previous position.																						
13	13		301									There aren't many of them, and they look just like ordinary wandering Corrupted.																						
14	14		301									A few hours ago—just after daybreak, to be precise—Roland didn't have any idea yet, but he and Lamia decided to head out first, trying to follow the known clues.																						
15	15		301									Soon, strange wandering Corrupted began to show up on their route every once in a while.																						
16	16		301									They kept coming. Every time, they ended up in Lamia and Roland's way, even in the areas where there was nothing to infest.																						
17	17		301									Like every time in the past, the small number of Corrupted do not pose any threat. But Roland feels something isn't quite right.																						
18	18		301									He extends his hand, trying to control their leader to turn back—

25	25		301								Lamia	?	2																					
26	26		301								Roland	Don't you feel strange? These annoying Corrupted just keep coming. They can always find us.	1																					
27	27		301								Roland	We changed our route many times, they came back every time, even in the areas impossible for Corrupted to exist.	1																					
28	28		301								Lamia	(Eek? I thought we were just lost...)	2																					
29	29		301								Lamia	Eek—!	2																					
30	30		301								Roland	Whoever is behind them, I have no idea what they want... Are they just testing us?	1																					
31	31		301								Roland	(Not necessarily. They should have sent stronger forces to test us. Maybe they just wanted to change our route, so they sent those Corrupted in the hope that we would avoid them.)	1																					
32	32		301								Roland	(Better ask Lamia to control them if they ever show up again. I can't let her know that I've lost control of the Corrupted.)	1

34	34		301								Lamia	?	2

52	52		301								Roland?	Unlike humans, attrition warfare isn't going to work on Ascendants. But if the opponents can control Corrupted, they are probably no different.	1																					
53	53		301								Roland?	They are definitely aware that such trivial attack are never going to pose any threat. If they send in all the Corrupted together, they might at least have a chance.	1

70	70		301									Lamia wonders why Roland doesn't do it himself, but she follows his order anyway—

122	122		301									Now that the Corrupted are no longer showing up, they must have achieved something. Which means—

156	156		301									Roland soon dispels the idea from his mind after thinking about that female.																						
157	157		301								Roland	"She" doesn't look like the type of agent that would attract Babylonia's attention.	1																					
158	158		301								Roland	Could it be us then...? No, I don't think so. We haven't done anything. The last time we exposed ourselves, we were with "her"...	1
