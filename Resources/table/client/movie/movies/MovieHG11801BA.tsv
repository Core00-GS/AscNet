4	4		301									Your keen senses notice the temperature changes, and your eyes see the vapor trail behind the fast-oncoming, long-range bullet without a scope in the simulated training area. You duck back, and it almost grazes your scalp.																						
5	5		301									Your opponent has missed. A flicker of light reflected from the scope on his sniper rifle flashes in the corner of your eye, revealing his location.																						
6	6		401							2	1511																							
7	7		301									Your magazine is empty. You pull the bolt back and put the bullet into the chamber with instinct. There is a slight heat around where your skin touches the heavy stock. "Click!" And your gun is loaded.																						
8	8		301									You begin searching with all your attention... And you spot the top half of a head in your scope, hidden among covers.																						
9	9		301									Now!																						
10	10		301									Without further thinking, you pull the trigger, and the bullet bursts out of the chamber with a bang, with a wisp of light blue smoke coming out of the muzzle.																						
11	11		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				System	Contestant A-14, Wanshi, is out. Environment simulation over. Logging out.

15	15		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The system notification announces all around the venue. Noisy chatter finds its way in as the sound of the machines running fades away.																						
16	16		301								Surprised Male Voice	What an excellent shot. The commandant catches the opponent in an instant...																						
17	17		301								Calm Male Voice	And Wanshi was beating us all without any mercy! Considering that the simulation has already been adjusted to balance the differences between a human and a Construct...	(Take off gears)																					
18	18		301									You remove the device above your eyes at the same time as the Construct across from you. As the chatters around you fade away from the two of you showing up, you both catch each other's eyes in this moment of silence.

21	21		201							1	500155																							
22	22		301							1	Chrome	Wanshi doesn't often engage in this kind of group exercise. He's more used to training alone.	1																					
23	23		301									Chrome, standing next to you, explains.																						
24	24		201							1	1081001	1																						
25	25		301							1	Kamui	If it weren't for him hogging this training room sleeping, he wouldn't be dragged into training by the commandants!	1																					
26	26		202							1					1																			
27	27		301									The simulation training room is often occupied by Constructs and commandants on their rest days. The training cabins are set up to balance the performance of Constructs and humans, making it easier to train together.																						
28	28		301									Liv has asked you not to overuse your right hand after you sprained it on a mission, so you opted to train here instead, and that was when you bumped into Strike Hawk and some commandants waiting to practice with Wanshi.																						
29	29		201							1	1081001	1																						
30	30		301							1	Kamui	By the way, Commandant, how does it feel to practice with this guy?	1																					
31	31		302								Pretty good.	32	He just...	35																				
32	32		301								Kamui	You're the only commandant that has defeated Wanshi so far!	1																					
33	33		301								Kamui	Before you logged in, Wanshi had no idea who he'd be up against. So there was no way he was letting you win on purpose!	1																					
34	34		302								Are you saying he'd let me win if he knew?	35	Why do I feel like he...	35																				
35	35		201							1	500273																							
36	36		301							1	Wanshi	...Ah, Gray Raven Commandant.	1																					
37	37		301									Wanshi suddenly interrupts the conversation as if he has just recognized you, and he nods at you.																						
38	38		201							1	500155																							
39	39		301							1	Chrome	Right, you've been on a mission together before, so you should know each other.	1																					
40	40		301								Chrome	But why are you here at the simulation training room today, Commandant? I've barely seen you here before.	1																					
41	41		302								It's not the best time for me to shoot a real firearm.	42																						
42	42		301								Chrome	Huh, is that so... Please take some rest, Commandant.	1																					
43	43		202							1					1																			
44	44		301								Commandant B	Chrome, should we continue? I didn't even get to use the gun just now! Wanshi found and "killed" me within seconds.																						
45	45		301								Commandant A	You can't even last three minutes against me. Stop making a fool out of yourself.																						
46	46		201							1	500155																							
47	47		301							1	Chrome	All commandants have their strengths, and not all of them are shooters. Besides, this simulation uses conventional snipers instead of the newer tactical pistols you are used to, so your unfamiliarity is only natural.	1																					
48	48		201							1	500273																							
49	49		301							1	Wanshi	Hmm... but I bet the Gray Raven Commandant must be a sharpshooter.	1																					
50	50		302							5000	I'm flattered.	53	Exactly, I'm the top gun of Babylonia!	54

53	53	55	301								Commandant B	After all, the Gray Raven Commandant is the first person to have ever hit Wanshi, right?																						
54	54		301								Commandant A	...As expected from the Gray Raven Commandant, I guess?																						
55	55		201							1	500155																							
56	56		301							1	Chrome	Wanshi, if you... Kamui, what are you doing there?	1

59	59		201							2	1081001	2	400																					
60	60		301							1	Kamui	Ah, you mean this? It's a sign I just made.	2																					
61	61		301									Kamui holds up the sign in his hands, which reads, "Strike Hawk Elite Sniper Holiday Training Partner, 50 Black Cards per session".																						
62	62		301								Chrome	...	1																					
63	63		301								Kamui	Wanshi, why are you looking so tired? It's your day off!	2																					
64	64		202							1	2				1																			
65	65		301									Being the center of attention, Wanshi, however, just looks away and lies back in the training cabin, seemingly ready to fall back asleep again.																						
66	66		201							1	1081001		-400																					
67	67		201							2	500273		400																					
68	68		301							1	Kamui	Stop sleeping, Wanshi! What are you doing? We're starting a new business here...	1																					
69	69		204							2	8																							
70	70		301								Wanshi	Huh...	2																					
71	71		301								Kamui	Captain, Wanshi is hogging the training room to sleep again!	1																					
72	72		202							1	2				1																			
73	73		301									Seeing this, another commandant in the training room shrugs.																						
74	74		301								Commandant A	I haven't had enough practice yet. Gray Raven Commandant, would you like to practice with me?																						
75	75		302								Sure.	76	Sorry, perhaps next time.	78																				
76	76		301								Commandant A	Great, bring it on!																						
77	77	82	301								Commandant B	I'm next!																						
78	78		301								Commandant A	Ah... but it's such a rare opportunity to meet the Gray Raven Commandant...																						
79	79		301								Commandant B	The commandant's probably tired, so stop being such a bother. Come practice with me!																						
80	80		301								Commandant A	...I should start with the solo mode!																						
81	81		301								Commandant B	Why are you being weirdly silent? Am I not good enough for you? Get back here!																						
82	82		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Everyone's attention gradually shifts this way. Amid the noises, it seems like you are the only one who notices that Wanshi has quietly left.
