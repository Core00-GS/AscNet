12	12		301								Vanessa	Forget it. I'll follow up on your shortcomings once the mission is complete.	1																					
13	13		301								Vanessa	Now that the surrounding areas have been cleared of Corrupted, sealing off the main roads have temporarily closed the city off from the outside world.	1																					
14	14		301								Vanessa	Bambinata, status report.	1																					
15	15		301								Bambinata	We still require another five minutes to disarm the city's protective barrier.																						
16	16		301								Vanessa	I sent an additional UAV. You have three minutes. In three minutes, the city will have a temporary power outage. If we don't seize this opportunity to finish the battle, this will come at a greater cost than anticipated.	1																					
17	17		301								Vanessa	If you cannot complete the mission in a timely manner, you know what the consequences are...	1																					
18	18		301								Bambinata	I... I'll try my best...																						
19	19		301									Liv and Bambinata remain silent on the comm channel. Vanessa slowly approaches the window of the temporary headquarters and looks out at the distant city.

21	21		301									Three minutes later, Vanessa gently taps her portable terminal.																						
22	22		301									The factory in the city was the first area to explode, causing all the machinery to disintegrate in the blast.																						
23	23		301									The second round of attacks targeted the Central Purification Filter and the Energy Center. The ensuing energy leakage resulted in a series of explosions that destroyed most of the city center. Corrupted hiding in the area were annihilated by the blast and the subsequent collapsing of buildings.																						
24	24		301								Vanessa	Hehe... Looks like the Engineering Force is going to be busy.	1																					
25	25		301								Vanessa	Oh well. Reconstruction work doesn't concern me.	1																					
26	26		301									Vanessa chuckles as a third round of attacks is launched from various firing points erected on the periphery of the city. Missiles sweep across the city, greatly reducing the Corrupted forces.

30	30		301							1	Liv	Master, why was the third attack launched ahead of schedule? Some of the Constructs forces couldn't evacuate in time.	2																					
31	31		301								Vanessa	They didn't need to evacuate. They were tasked with luring enemies to the designated areas.	1																					
32	32		301								Vanessa	Hehe. Your naivety reminds me of a former classmate. What a fool...	1																					
33	33		301								Vanessa	Had they not been sacrificed, the Corrupted would've continued to run rampant and attack even more Constructs. Is that what you want to see?	1																					
34	34		301								Vanessa	This would result in our defeat. Are you so naive as to think that you can shoulder the price of failure?	1																					
35	35		301								Liv	But...	2																					
36	36		301								Vanessa	Sacrificing a few Constructs in exchange for the safety of many more people is a cost-efficient exchange of resources.	1																					
37	37		301								Vanessa	Our operations will save far more people. You should be happy about this. Are you not?	1																					
38	38		301								Liv	...	2																					
39	39		301								Vanessa	Seeing as how you made me laugh, I'll forgive you just this once.	1

51	51		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Since the operation eliminated the Corrupted throughout the city with such little collateral damage, Egret had become a highly praised squad by the military.																						
52	52		301									However, Liv did not make an appearance during the commendation ceremony.																						
53	53		301									Because Liv knew that this was not the outcome she had anticipated.																						
54	54		301									However, Babylonia cared not. People only cared about the righteousness of victory.																						
55	55		301									No names are recorded in this righteousness, only the ever-increasing casualty number.																						
56	56		301									Whereas a soldier's duty toward righteousness made Liv realize that there was no room for naivety, let alone doubt.																						
57	57		301									Regardless of these principles, distress continues to weigh down on Liv's heart.																						
58	58		301									In order to give herself some solace, Liv goes to the training room as usual to temporarily distract herself with a round of intense training.																						
59	59		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					But upon arriving at the training room, Liv discovers that it is already occupied.

65	65		301									The female Construct, Lucia, is standing in the middle of three other Constructs as tensions begin to rise.																						
66	66		301								Lucia	Let me guess... If I lose, I hand over the commandant. Correct?	2																					
67	67		301								Construct	We're all ready to be deployed for combat, but who knows how many months it will take with you...	3

90	90		301									She sees Lucia standing in the center of the room badly wounded. The other Constructs that had provoked her were now rolling on the ground in agony. Lucia props herself up with her katana, scanning the room.

103	103		301								Researcher	Commander said a Support Construct is required... How about this lieutenant with first-class military accolades?	1																					
104	104		301								Researcher	But she's already assigned to a team...	1

110	110		301								Vanessa	Hmm? I can't believe someone actually wants that naive little toy.	2																					
111	111		301								Vanessa	Seeing as this is an order from the commander, I'm sure he knows that he must offer another toy in exchange!	2																					
112	112		301								Researcher	Of course. Egret has already been issued the right to select an outstanding member in return.	1																					
113	113		301								Researcher	Select from any of the unassigned Constructs whenever you so please.	1																					
114	114		301								Researcher	Egret will also receive preference for additional coatings, weaponry, and frames to make up for any imbalance in combat power due to being shorthanded.	1																					
115	115		301								Vanessa	What a generous exchange of resources.	2																					
116	116		301								Vanessa	Well then, take her away. I've been growing tired of playing with the same toy anyway.	2																					
117	117		301								Researcher	Toy...?	1																					
118	118		301								Vanessa	Is there a problem?	2																					
119	119		301								Researcher	No, it's nothing. I hope Egret continues to achieve victory for humanity.	1
