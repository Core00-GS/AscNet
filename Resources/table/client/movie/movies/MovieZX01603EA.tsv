38	39		301							1	Liv	Understood.	1

40	41		302								What is it?	42

44	45		301							1	Lee	Then how did the program escape? Advanced camouflage? A cross-program pathway as a springboard? Directly hijacking remote data? Altering the lower port levels of Gestalt?	2																					
45	46		301								Lee	It couldn't have been changing the port levels. The risk of being detected by Gestalt's anti-interference protocols is too high...	2																					
46	47		301								Lee	First and foremost, cross-reference with a data slice from five minutes ago.	2																					
47	48		301								Liv	On it.	1																					
48	49		301								Lee	In the meantime...	2																					
49	50		301								Lee	Commandant, what method do you think she used?	2																					
50	51		301								Lee	We have to rely on your reasoning to figure this out. Having been dissociated with living as a human for so long, our way of thinking is closer to that of a machine.	2																					
51	52		301								Lee	It's harder to figure out our blind spots when we all think alike.	2																					
52	53		302								Advanced camouflage.	54	Springboard.	56	Data hijacking.	57																		
53	54		301									(No... Liv's scanning capability would've detected any signs of camouflage...)																						
54	55	57	301								Lee	It's unlikely to maintain an advanced data camouflage in front of Liv. If there were any sign of hijacking a program, there would've been traces left behind...	2																					
55	56	57	301								Lee	It's possible.	2																					
56	57		301								Lee	Forcibly hijacking a program requires a burst of considerable data strength, but I didn't detect any change in level output... And data camouflage doesn't seem too possible with Liv around...	2																					
57	58		301								Lee	In that case, maybe we should consider the possibility that the program utilized data replacement as a springboard?	2																					
58	59		301								Liv	There is no way to detect it directly, but utilizing data replacement at such a high speed is bound to make the target program behave abnormally.	1

63	64		301								Liv	Yes... My thoughts exactly.	1																					
64	65		301								Lee	Liv will be in charge of scanning, and I'll be in charge of data analysis.	2

77	78		301								Huaxu	Computing power has been prioritized to maintain infiltration efforts. It was impossible to allocate enough power to the sub-terminal for combat purposes.
