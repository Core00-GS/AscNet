5	5		301			DialogEnable						As Dragon Boat Festival draws near, Gray Raven marches forward on a vast plain and finally arrives at a village near the capital.																						
6	6		301									It is the eighth village they have been to. When looking beyond the forest in the distance, the majestic buildings of the capital can already be seen.																						
7	7		301									But right now they have something else to do.																						
8	8		301									This is the eighth crate that Gray Raven has given out. Each time Liv gives a crate full of materials to the villager chief, she is met with the same response.																						
9	9		201							1	1031001																							
10	10		301							1	Liv	You don't need to pay us. We only want you to use them in the right place.	1																					
11	11		202							1					1																			
12	12		301									Although still holding it back, the crowd begins to cry out in awe. To them, gathering bamboo leaves in a forest full of monsters definitely is not easy.																						
13	13		301									Among the villagers' thankful messages, Gray Raven quickly bids farewell to them to avoid being surrounded again.																						
14	14		301									The Nameless Sage has been waiting outside the village.																						
15	15		201							1	500384																							
16	16		301							1	Nameless Sage	This is already the eighth village, Madam Liv.	1																					
17	17		301								Nameless Sage	I'm worried that you will end up giving all the materials away.	1																					
18	18		301								Nameless Sage	Would you like me to keep the materials reserved for entering the Realm of Dragons on your behalf first?	1																					
19	19		201							1	1031001																							
20	20		301							1	Liv	We didn't really reserve any materials...	1																					
21	21		201							1	500026																							
22	22		301							1	Lee	I almost forgot. But even if we have given everything out, we can still return to the starting point and collect again, can't we?	1																					
23	23		201							1	500384																							
24	24		301							1		The Nameless Sage looks at you, hoping you can persuade them.																						
25	25		302								I agree with their decision.	26																						
26	26		301									The Nameless Sage lets out a sigh.																						
27	27		301								Nameless Sage	I am just concerned that re-collecting materials would waste too much time and make you miss the best window.	1																					
28	28		302								Best window?	29																						
29	29		301								Nameless Sage	Each year, this is the best season to search for the Realm of Dragons, because the chance for the realm to appear is the highest during this time. We learned this from many generations of adventurers.	1																					
30	30		201							1	500166																							
31	31		301							1	Lucia	Chance to appear?	1																					
32	32		201							1	500026																							
33	33		301							1	Lee	...I just looked it up. It seems to be a common setting in fantasy worlds. The mission's target area is right there, but cannot be observed due to some reason.	1																					
34	34		201							1	500166																							
35	35		301							1	Lucia	Are you implying that area will hide by itself?	1																					
36	36		302								You can say so...	37																						
37	37		201							1	500384																							
38	38		301							1	Nameless Sage	Besides, the monsters in the north have been getting a little unsettled. They may come down at any time.	1																					
39	39		302								Restless?	40																						
40	40		301								Nameless Sage	The young people were talking about it not long ago. Some large, scary things had appeared in the Northern Wilds and slaughtered other monsters.	1																					
41	41		301									You open the Heroes' Journal left by the Travelling Wizard and find the Real of Dragons is located right inside a large red circle underneath the Northern Wilds.																						
42	42		301									You also notice that the Nameless Sage is looking a bit strange.																						
43	43		302								What's wrong?	44																						
44	44		301								Nameless Sage	...	1																					
45	45		301								Nameless Sage	No, I'm just worried that the monsters would invade the Realm of Dragons directly if we keep wasting time here.	1																					
46	46		201							1	500166																							
47	47		301							1	Lucia	Rest assured that we will get there as soon as possible.	1																					
48	48		201							1	500384																							
49	49		301							1	Nameless Sage	Really? That's fantastic. When are you going to head out? Like, right now?	1																					
50	50		201							1	500026																							
51	51		301							1	Lee	Well, regarding this, we still need some help from you.	1																					
52	52		302								You said we would be rewarded.	53																						
53	53		302								We can pick a magic item to our liking.	54																						
54	54		201							1	500384																							
55	55		301							1	Nameless Sage	Um... Maybe... Perhaps I did say that. Fine, what do you need?	1																					
56	56		302								Something that can be used on items to track the approximate direction of the Realm of Dragons.	57																						
57	57		301								Nameless Sage	Are you sure? I don't have anything from the Realm of Dragons with me. All Twin Souls in the nearby towns have been used up in making the replicas. You may not have any left.	1																					
58	58		302								(Nod to confirm.)	59																						
59	59		301								Nameless Sage	Whatever. You can still try your luck in the capital... There should be some replicas of the Ancient Triangle from the Realm of Dragons left there.	1																					
60	60		301									The Nameless Sage takes out a staff from his robe as he speaks.																						
61	61		202							1					1																			
62	62		301									You nod to Lee. He takes the staff and begins to identify it.																						
63	63		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	"Staff of Detection". It can point out the approximate direction of the original owner of an item.	1																					
64	64		301									Lee takes a glimpse at Lucia and Liv. You all spontaneously move out and stand in four different corners.																						
65	65		301									Lee then takes out the robe he took from the Travelling Wizard earlier and puts it over the gem on top of the Staff of Detection. He releases his hand, letting the staff fall.																						
66	66		401							1	36																							
67	67		301									The gem points at the Nameless Sage, who quickly looks at the forest behind him and moves aside. The staff rolls on the ground and points at him again. The Nameless Sage dodges again and pretends to look at the plain behind.																						
68	68		401							1	205																							
69	69		301									Lee, Lucia, Liv, and yourself all begin to smile as you watch the Nameless Sage dodging over and over again until he stops.																						
70	70		201							1	1031001	1																						
71	71		301							1	Liv	You must be tired. Do you need some rest?	1																					
72	72		201							1	500384																							
73	73		301							1	Nameless Sage	Ah... Um... Thanks, heroes... I think there might be some problem with this staff, so...	1																					
74	74		201							1	1031001	1																						
75	75		301							1	Liv	Don't worry, we have a lot of time. This time we can take it slow...	1

81	81		301									A blinding flash bursts out from the Nameless Sage's hand. He leaps up as the team temporarily loses vision...

83	83		201							1	500026																							
84	84		301							1	Lee	I immediately use the enchanted necklace "Magic Protection" that the priest in the last village gave us.	1																					
85	85		202							1					1																			
86	86		302								Lucia!	87																						
87	87		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	Lucia rolls a Dexterity check.																						
88	88		201							1	1031001																							
89	89		301							1	Liv	I want to use the "Lucky Ring" given by villagers to increase Lucia's chance of success.	1																					
90	90		202							1					1																			
91	91		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	Acknowledged. Calculating the result... Lucia rolls a critical success.			1

94	94		401							2	3077																							
95	95		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	The Nameless Sage has a head-on collision with Lucia's sheath. He falls on the grass like a fly slapped by a swatter.																						
96	96		301									Ayla rolls another Luck check for the Nameless Sage. Fortunately, he did not pass out from the bash... How unfortunate.

99	99		201							3	500026		600																					
100	100		301							1		The Nameless Sage unconsciously holds his arm up to cover his face when the team approaches him.																						
101	101		301								Lucia	Gotcha, you evil-minded agent.	2																					
102	102		202							1	2	3			1																			
103	103		201							1	500384																							
104	104		301							1	Nameless Sage	I'm no agent! I am the Sage who summons heroes to help our people. I have never lied to anyone!	1																					
105	105		201							1	500026																							
106	106		301							1	Lee	Aren't you the Travelling Wizard?	1																					
107	107		201							1	500384																							
108	108		301							1	Nameless Sage	What Travelling Wizard? I don't know that guy.	1																					
109	109		302								Just like you, he is a hero summoner who has "never lied to anyone."	110

114	114		301							1	Liv	He only made us fall from high above, asked us to do a lot of tasks for him, and ran away with all the rewards and some materials...	1																					
115	115		301								Lee	And turned us into children because "it was easier to hide", so he could easily get away...	3																					
116	116		301								Lucia	Commandant said we ought to beat him up if we ever got to see him again.	2																					
117	117		302								I suggest you confess.	118	What style would you like for your coffin?	118																				
118	118		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	All Gray Raven members roll an Intimidate check. The results are... Success, success, success, and success.																						
119	119		301									Seeing the four smiley faces, the Nameless Sage feels like the world is spinning around him. He is terrified and shakes his head.

121	121		201							1	500384																							
122	122		301							1	Nameless Sage	You can't do this to me! I used to be a hero like you, then I took an arcane missile to the knee.	1																					
123	123		302								(Ignore)	124	(Ask for rewards)	124																				
124	124		301								Nameless Sage	Fine, I'll pay, I'll pay.	1

126	126		201							1	500410																							
127	127		301							1	Dungeon Master Ayla	The Nameless Sage cancels his camouflage spell and turns out to be the Travelling Wizard himself. He puts 10 gold coins in a line in front of you.																						
128	128		302								(Take them)	134	(There's got to be something else?)	129																				
129	129		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	The Travelling Wizard took out another 5 gold coins to compensate you.																						
130	130		302								(Take them)	134	(There's got to be something else?)	131																				
131	131		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	The Travelling Wizard took out another 1 gold coin to compensate you.																						
132	132		302								(Take them)	134	(There's got to be something else?)	133																				
133	133		301								Travelling Wizard	Hey, enough is enough. I'll show you what I have up my sleeve.	1

135	135		401							2	848																							
136	136		301									The Travelling Wizard suddenly points to the sky, shooting a flare-like light ball upward. It then explodes into fireworks.																						
137	137		301								Travelling Wizard	Calling all former heroes! Come help me, my friends!	1																					
138	138		401						200	2	954																							
139	139		401							2	848																							
140	140		301									Soon, another similar light ball rises to the sky from not far away and explodes into three mocking faces with their tongues out, along with a spell that delivers a voice message—																						
141	141		301									"You deserve it."																						
142	142		301								Travelling Wizard	...	1																					
143	143		302								...	144																						
144	144		201							1	500166																							
145	145		301							1	Lucia	What do we do now, Commandant?	1

148	148		401							2	3077																							
149	149		301							1		In the flash of an eye, the Travelling Wizard twists his body from an impossible angle and kneels to the ground, as if he and the earth have become one.																						
150	150		301								Travelling Wizard	I'm sorry, mighty heroes! I promise I will never, ever, never-ever do this again...	1																					
151	151		201							1	500166																							
152	152		301							1	Lucia	Just surrender what you earned from the frauds.	1																					
153	153		201							1	500410																							
154	154		301							1	Travelling Wizard	...Um, I'm terribly sorry, but I have spent it all.	1																					
155	155		302								...How?	156																						
156	156		301								Travelling Wizard	Because the orphanage needed a lot of money...	1																					
157	157		301								Travelling Wizard	Gargh! What are you doing?! Nooo! Help!	1																					
158	158		302								Search his body with force.	159																						
159	159		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	Commandant rolls... Success. There aren't many coins left on him, but a letter of appreciation with childish drawings on it catches your attention.																						
160	160		202							1					1																			
161	161		201							1	500166																							
162	162		301							1	Lucia	Looks like he didn't lie this time.	1																					
163	163		201							1	1031001																							
164	164		301							1	Liv	Still, what you did was not right, Mr. Wizard. You were supposed to pay them out as rewards. No matter what you want to do with them, you need to seek approval first.	1																					
165	165		201							1	500410																							
166	166		301							1	Travelling Wizard	I had no other way out... The orphanage would go bankrupt if I didn't do that.	1																					
167	167		202							1					1																			
168	168		301									Gray Raven members exchange looks with one another.																						
169	169		201							1	1031001																							
170	170		301							1	Liv	That's not true, Mr. Wizard.	1																					
171	171		301								Liv	We can waive our portion, but you must return the rest to the others.	1																					
172	172		201							1	500410																							
173	173		301							1	Travelling Wizard	But I don't have that much money.	1																					
174	174		201							1	1031001																							
175	175		301							1	Liv	Then tell them the truth and try to talk with them.	1																					
176	176		301								Liv	If they can't accept it, you should work hard to earn more coins so you can pay them back.	1																					
177	177		201							1	500410																							
178	178		301							1		The Travelling Wizard didn't answer immediately. Instead, he stares at Liv and thinks for a while, then lets out a sigh.																						
179	179		301								Travelling Wizard	...Fine, I give up. I have never met any heroes like you.	1																					
180	180		201							1	1031001	1																						
181	181		301							1	Liv	Good. I hope you can keep your promise.	1																					
182	182		202							1					1																			
183	183		301									You no longer have any reason to stay here. After a short discussion, you decide to continue heading toward the capital.																						
184	184		201							1	500410																							
185	185		301							1	Travelling Wizard	What are you going to do?	1																					
186	186		201							1	500026

189	189		301							1	Travelling Wizard	...	1																					
190	190		301								Travelling Wizard	Fine. I asked you to do it, so I should provide my help too.	1																					
191	191		301								Travelling Wizard	Besides, maybe you really can find that place and enter it.	1																					
192	192		302								What do you mean...	193																						
193	193		301								Travelling Wizard	It's been a long time since anyone ever got inside the Realm of Dragons.	1																					
194	194		301								Travelling Wizard	How about a real "transparent deal"? I will provide you with real, much-needed help, as long as you can do me a little favor...	1																					
195	195		202							1					1																			
196	196		301			RImgBg1Shake					???	So, what did he get into this time? Or is he being bullied?!																						
197	197		301									The sudden shouting has scared the Travelling Wizard. He immediately bounces up from the grass.																						
198	198		301									A few well-armed adventurers rush out from the forest and gaze at Gray Raven.																						
199	199		301								Sharpshooter	He must have got into trouble again, sigh. Ever since I knew him, he has been doing this non-stop...																						
200	200		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Knight	Dear heroes! We used to be heroes too. Can you please return him to us after beating him up?
