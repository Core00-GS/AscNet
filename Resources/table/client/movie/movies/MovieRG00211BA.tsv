17	16		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						As you descend from the aircraft, the giant tower, which looked like a white column from up in the air, becomes an imposing colossus.																						
18	17		301									Despite the wear and tear on the surface of the tower, the blue logo and the four letters "AAXA" are clear as day.

28	27		301							1		The hallway and lobby are filled with tents and makeshift structures that look at odds with the simplicity of the building housing them.
