11	11		301									The deck of the giant vessel is jam-packed with people, shouting, seething, trampling over each other.																						
12	12		301									Shouts peddling wares fill the ship. Curious-looking merchants, like ants, fill every inch of the space.																						
13	13		301								Peddling Voices	Dried earthworms! Dried earthworms, dug fresh from the mud in the ballast! Get one for three grubs or one mile!																						
14	14		301								Curses	Hey! Hey! Whatcha think ya doing? Use your eyes, not your hands! That's 200 mileage if you chip my wares!

24	24		301								Chrome	Kamui, wait—	2																					
25	25		301									Chrome yanks Kamui back before he can stride into the crowds. With his free hand, he alters the frequency of the Inver-Device in order to receive a sudden message.

31	30		301									The rushed words were uttered by a blonde youth who soon appears in the line of sight of the two Strike Hawk members, beaming. He looks delicate and friendly.																						
32	31		301								Chrome	This is executive officer Nikola's private channel. Who are you?	2																					
33	32		301								???	Don't worry, I'm Nikola's agent. He's on another mission, so I'm in charge of getting in touch with our contacts.	3																					
34	33		301								???	Here. My credentials.	3																					
35	34		301									The blonde youth could have sent his electronic ID to Chrome, but for some reason, he pulls out the physical employee ID from inside his suit and holds it close to the screen.

39	38		301							1	Kamui	Ooh, a rookie tactician in the Combat Department... and your name is Murray...	1																					
40	39		301								Chrome	Wait. Murray, huh... I apologize for the impudence, but are you related to Lee from the Gray Raven squad?	2																					
41	40		301								Murray	Yep, you got it. I'm Brother's brother. Uh, that sounded weird. Anyway, yeah, I'm Lee's younger brother.	3																					
42	41	551	301									The youth—Murray—smiles and greets the two.																						
43	551	42	204							3	0																							
44	42		301								Murray	Anyway, back to the main point. Executive officer Nikola should have already told you about the mission details, but I'll still run it past you again as per official procedure.	3																					
45	43		301								Murray	For this mission, the Strike Hawk squad shall investigate the suddenly-appeared KCC vessel to see if there is indeed a Chamber of Commerce presence on the ship, and also search for the subsidiary AI systems of Gestalt.	3																					
46	44		301								Chrome	The second part is the one we should prioritize, right?	2																					
47	45		301								Murray	Yeah. It's a direct assignment from Executive officer Nikola. We don't know why this KCC ship showed up all of a sudden, but the movements of other factions is not the primary concern of this mission.	3																					
48	46		301								Murray	Word for word from Executive Officer Nikola, "Our main objective is to find if there are any Gestalt-related AIs on the ship."	3																					
49	47		301								Murray	If there aren't, we retreat immediately. If there are...	3																					
50	48		301								Chrome	We take them. By force.	2																					
51	49		301								Murray	Well, that's what it says on paper. But it might be better to retreat immediately after the inspection. There's only two of you, so combat is gonna be tough.	3																					
52	50		301								Kamui	Um, question!	1																					
53	51		301								Murray	Sure, if I know the answer.	3																					
54	52		301								Kamui	I keep hearing about it, but... What exactly is Gestalt?	1																					
55	53		301								Murray	...	3																					
56	54		301								Chrome	Sorry, our Kamui is a bit—	2																					
57	55		301									With Kamui's untimely question, everyone falls silent. Murray gapes in disbelief.																						
58	56		301								Murray	Um, no, it's fine. Since you have a question, I'll give you a brief answer. Gestalt is... well, an AI system that can perform super-large-scale calculations.	3																					
59	57		301								Murray	This AI will self-develop and learn, and perform all sorts of calculations or research for us according to our needs.	3																					
60	58		301								Kamui	Wow, that's dope. So we can just chuck everything to Gestalt then, huh?	1																					
61	59		301								Murray	Essentially, yes. Some used to call Gestalt a dream come true. It didn't end up being that amazing, but it still completed its most important mission of...	3																					
62	60		301								Murray	...Protecting humans. In fact, Babylonia is protected by Gestalt.	3																					
63	61		301								Kamui	Like how our Inver-Devices protect Babylonia?	1																					
64	62		301								Murray	Not exactly, but that also works as an explanation.	3																					
65	63		301								Murray	Gestalt is a system that keeps Babylonia running. Kind of like a firewall for Babylonia.	3																					
66	64		301								Murray	However, there's more than one AI developed with the same low-level infrastructure as Gestalt. Which means that the defense of Babylonia—	3																					
67	65		301								Chrome	—Could be at risk of being broken through if someone else manages to find the source code of Gestalt-related AIs.	2																					
68	66		301								Murray	Yes.	3																					
69	67		301									Murray sighs, and Kamui heaves a heavy sigh as well.																						
70	700		204							3	8																							
71	68		301								Murray	Either way, we can't allow the wrong people to find the source code. I'll act as support during your operation. Let's set off then, Strike Hawk.	3																					
72	69		301								Kamui	Ooh! Let's go!	1																					
73	70		301								Kamui	Wait... Capt., what exactly are we gonna do?	1																					
74	71		301								Chrome	Don't act all excited to set off one second and become confused the next. But, well... I do have some clues. Someone back at the market just caught my eye.	2																					
75	72		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Chrome	Follow me, Kamui!	2
