4	5		301									Civilians rushed in to see if the residential regions were intact. Simon also left with the crowd, saying that he needed to look into something with Atiel.																						
5	6		301									Leaving only you, and the Forest Guards, all lost in contemplation.

10	1003		302								What's wrong?	9	Who's Amberia?	10																				
11	9	1004	301								Rosetta	Just a name I never thought I'd hear again‚ÄîAmberia...	1																					
12	10	1004	301								Rosetta	She is the sin borne by the Forest Guard...	1																					
13	1004		204							1	4																							
14	11		301								Rosetta	I originally planned on keeping you out of this, but seeing as the bionics mentioned her name, I think you should know who we're up against.	1																					
15	12		301								Rosetta	Before the Punishing Virus, the ARU was also a prosperous metropolis.	1																					
16	13		301								Rosetta	Even at the start of the outbreak, it remained untouched just as life was before. There were no cases in the city.	1																					
17	14		301								Rosetta	Some people even had no idea what the virus was. Amidst our naivety, the ARU conducted one foolish experiment after another.	1																					
18	15		301								Rosetta	...The ARU applied the Construct tech given by the World Government to military science.	1																					
19	16		301								Rosetta	They believed that the Punishing Virus would soon come to an end, and then the balance of the world would be shuffled anew.	1																					
20	17		301								Rosetta	To get an edge in the new world, some of the decision makers and engineers decided to create a humanoid-hybrid Construct by the name of "Amberia".	1																					
21	18		301								Rosetta	Not only a dreadnought on its own, Amberia can also command the bionic series that came with her conception.	1																					
22	1005		302								The bionics serve Amberia?	19	So who is Amberia...?	20																				
23	19	1006	301								Rosetta	Yeah. The bionics were developed as Amberia's sub-units.	1																					
24	20	1006	301								Rosetta	We don't know much about Amberia. Only that she was eighteen before she became a Construct.	1																					
25	1006		204							1	8																							
26	21		301								Rosetta	The ARU wanted Amberia and the bionics to be their perfect weapons. But they never knew humanoid-hybrids could turn out to be such monsters.	1																					
27	22		301								Rosetta	The bionics wielded immense power, but the ARU never thought that Amberia would go berserk upon her activation.	1																					
28	23		301								Rosetta	The ARU became hell on earth in an instant. Amberia and her bionics ravaged the land, killing countless people in a sea of fire and brimstone.	1																					
29	1007		204							1	14																							
30	24		301								Rosetta	To contain Amberia, the ARU dispatched an innumerable amount of ships and narwhals, like Derek. The sacrifices were countless...	1																					
31	1008		302								Did they win?		Did Amberia die?																					
32	25		301								Rosetta	Yes. Amberia was vaporized in a barrage of explosives, and we lost her signal. The battle was finally over.	1																					
33	26		301								Rosetta	But the ARU also lost it all. Even before the ravages of the virus, this land was already in ruins because of Amberia.	1																					
34	27		301								Rosetta	Afterwards, all engineers involved in creating her were either executed or imprisoned for life. As for their family and closest friends...	1																					
35	28		301								Rosetta	They were branded as sinners.	1																					
36	5000		302								The Forest Guards...	29	Are you the descendants of those engineers?	30																				
37	29	1009	301								Rosetta	Yes. They were later modified and labeled as traitors of the ARU‚Äîthe Forest Guards.	1																					
38	30	1009	301								Rosetta	Some yes‚Äîothers no. Regardless, we are all seen as sinners.	1																					
39	1009		204							1	4																							
40	31		301								Rosetta	...But as I said, Amberia should've been killed long ago, but the bionics just mentioned her name.	1																					
41	1010		302								Could it be just a bug?	32	Amberia must be alive.	34																				
42	32	33	301								Rosetta	Whether it's a bug or not, the number of bionics we've been seeing is already suspicious. There shouldn't have been so many left after that battle.	1																					
43	33	35	301								Rosetta	It's possible that Amberia is still alive.	1																					
44	34	35	301								Rosetta	That's what I was thinking, Commandant.	1																					
45	35		301								Rosetta	But that would mean we've been fighting the bionics under her control and mistook them for the "tide" this whole time.	1																					
46	36		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Rosetta	I can't say for sure about the past tides, but this one... I think we should confirm this with the captain.	1
