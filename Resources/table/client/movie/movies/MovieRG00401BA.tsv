6	6		301									The hammer strikes the nail, ringing as it sinks into the ground.

8	8		301									With another heavy blow of the hammer, the nail is buried deeper into the frozen soil, until it strikes a hard layer of ice.																						
9	9		301									This should be enough for pitching a tent. Any further into the ice, and it will be a pain to get out.

13	13		301									Lee hands over a steaming tin cup. The faint smell of pine needles fills your nose.																						
14	14		301								Lee	It's pine needle tea just brewed by Diana and Sylvia.	1																					
15	15		302								Thank you.	16																						
16	16		301								Lee	Sylvia... Apparently, she's a technical assistance consultant sent by the Science Council.	1																					
17	17		301								Lee	She used to be a negotiator for the Northern Counter-terrorism Department as well.	1																					
18	18		301								Lee	Don't know why the council would send a negotiator to work part-time as a technical adviser, but Asimov attests to her technical prowess.	1																					
19	19		301								Lee	Commandant, drink some tea and have a rest. We'll finish pitching the tent.	1																					
20	20		302								I really appreciate it...	21																						
21	21		302								But please don't.	22

24	24		302								Promise you won't turn the nails into pancakes?	25																						
25	25		301								Lee	...Do we have spare nails we can practice on?	1

30	30		301							1	Liv	They're organizing a dinner party in the evening, and they invited us as well.	2																					
31	31		302								Nice.	32																						
32	32		301								Lucia	The dinner is on the Maria, which is quite far from the settlement. We might want to hurry.	1																					
33	33		302								But... the tent...	34																						
34	34		301								Lucia	We'll help with the tent! We Constructs can get it done in no time!	1
