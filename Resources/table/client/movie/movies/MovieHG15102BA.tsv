14	2333		204							1	2

16	12		301								Kamui	Anyway, if there's nothing else you need me for, I'll be off.	1

25	156		302								Cute...?	16	Didn't he almost kill you?	17																				
26	16		301								Kamui	I rubbed off on him, of course, after all the time we spent together. Besides, you're good at discovering the cute sides of others. It's a specialty of yours!	1																					
27	157		302								That's an exaggeration!	18	Are you sure that's not a compliment for yourself?	18																				
28	17		301								Kamui	He's a bit direct, that's all. Besides, I won in the end, because I had you on my side. So you should trust in yourself!	1																					
29	18		301								Kamui	Anyway, I don't plan to see that guy again. It was annoying enough already having him watching my every move! From now on he'll be watching YOUR every move instead, Commandant.	1

50	31		301								Camu	Adjusted? You mean from the previous battle?	1																					
51	165		302								Yes.	32	For reconstructing the scene in the sim mission.	33																				
52	32		301								Camu	You want to hold the simulated mission again or something?	1																					
53	166		302								I want to reconstruct the scene.	34																						
54	33		301								Camu	Didn't the Council tell you to stop with that kind of training?	1																					
55	167		302								Adjustments have been done, though.	34	I have my reasons.	34																				
56	34		301									Camu gazes at you with a suspicious frown, but accepts the explanation.																						
57	35		301								Camu	...If you say so.	1																					
58	36		301								Camu	However, I need to remind you that, if another accident like that one happens, I'm not taking any responsibility.	1																					
59	37		301								Camu	You asked for this. Not my fault if they lose a precious commandant of theirs.	1
