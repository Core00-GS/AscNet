6	6		301			DialogEnable				1	Karenina	Alright, alright—these should be enough. Can you tell us your classified information already? By the way, isn't this...	2																					
7	7		301								Bianca	Right, I seem to recall... They're "red envelopes," aren't they?	1																					
8	8		204							3	1																							
9	9		301								Nanami	That's correct! You're looking at it—Nanami's secret weapon!	3																					
10	10		302								Red envelopes...	11	I wasn't expecting this...	12																				
11	11		301								Karenina	...Red envelopes?	2																					
12	12		301								Bianca	It doesn't really make sense, but we've collected quite a number of them...	1																					
13	13		301								Nanami	Sure you did! Now, the next step of the plan!	3

16	16		301								Nanami	And here comes the classified information!	3																					
17	17		301								Nanami	What you didn't know is that—their name is "Xi"! I named them myself!	3																					
18	18		302								"Xi"?	19	You named them?	20																				
19	19		301								Nanami	Yep, I named them after their habits!	3																					
20	20		301								Nanami	Nanami was the first one to discover them, so she had the right to name them! Are you jealous?	3																					
21	21		301								Nanami	Xi aren't our enemies! They're small "auto-mechanoid" that live underground. And they're very timid! They'll run on the faintest sound of battle. Y'know, like... "POW!" or "BOOM!", something like that.	3																					
22	22		301								Nanami	But they're also really fond of relaxing celebrations... Anyway, they aren't going to hurt anyone...	3																					
23	23		301								Nanami	They aren't aggressive—all they do is pretty graffiti. That's why I picked them a name from the database the moment I found them!	3																					
24	24		301								Nanami	"Xi" in the past was also a small monster, just like them... It hated loud noises, it was a little greedy, and it was an absolute night owl.	3																					
25	25		302								You know so much about such random things...	26																						
26	26		301								Nanami	And Nanami found them near Lunar New Year! That's why I chose that name!	3																					
27	27		301								Nanami	As to why we're hunting them down—that's classified information until you've completed the next stage of our plan!	3																					
28	28		302								That's cunning...	29

32	32		301							1	Bianca	I'm also very curious... Nanami, we just have to collect more of the red envelopes, right?	3																					
33	33		201							3	500091	1																						
34	34		301							1	Nanami	That's right! We'll trade!	3

37	37		301							1	Karenina	You're out of information, aren't you? You're just tricking us into helping you!	2																					
38	38		301								Nanami	Karey deary, haven't you learned? We're friends! Be nice to your friend!	3

40	40		301								Karenina	What did you think I do? I thought you were in danger, and here I am! Don't push it!	2																					
41	41		301								Nanami	Oh... Then I'll apologize after our big hunt? I'll do it properly!	3																					
42	42		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Karenina	I-I don't need your apologies! Just don't stir up any more troubles, alright? Now, get out of my way! I need to go collecting!	2
