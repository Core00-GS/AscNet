13	13		301							1	Nikola	These Kowloongers must have lost their mind! First they reject our proposal to fight against our common enemy, and now they're attacking us?!	1

16	16		301							1	Hassen	Flexing their muscles, I guess.	2																					
17	17		301								Nikola	Utterly vain and stupid!	1																					
18	18		301								Nikola	Now that your negotiation failed, time to step back and let me take the helm. I'm going to dispatch an elite squad to bring back that AI to keep it from falling into Ascendant hands.	1																					
19	19		301								Hassen	That will only lead to more conflicts with Kowloong.	2																					
20	20		301								Nikola	You got any better idea? You don't seriously expect us to sit on our hands waiting for them to defeat the Ascendants, do you?	1																					
21	21		301								Hassen	What I'm trying to say is that we should join this war.	2																					
22	22		301								Nikola	Do I have to remind you that Kowloong has flatly turned down our alliance proposal?	1																					
23	23		301								Hassen	Doesn't mean we can't act on our own. We're gonna go in and defend the weakest parts of Kowloong. That's my plan.	2																					
24	24		301									As he speaks, Hassen unfurls the map of Kowloong and marks the route Gray Raven just traveled with red circles.																						
25	25		301								Nikola	You can't be serious, Hassen. It'd be a huge area to cover.	1																					
26	26		301								Hassen	Do I look like I'm joking?	2																					
27	27		301								Hassen	For this fightâ€”noâ€”this war, I'm going to be at the front lines. Celica!	2

32	32		201							1	500011																							
33	33		301							1	Hassen	Spread the word. Gather everyone available. Tell them to cease all current tasks except the priority-S ones, and redeploy them to Kowloong for this defense campaign.	1

35	35		201							1	500001																							
36	36		301							1	Celica	What about the supply line?	1

38	38		201							1	500011																							
39	39		301							1	Hassen	Set up a large base like the one we use in field operations. We only need to ensure access to emergency supplies.	1																					
40	40		301								Hassen	Nikola, if I put you in charge of Babylonia while I'm away, will that be fine?	1

43	43		301							1	Nikola	...Why go to such lengths to help an organization that refuses to partner with us?	1

46	46		301							1	Hassen	We have to. I don't want to miss another chance.	2																					
47	47		301								Hassen	I'm sure you can understand that, Nikola.	2																					
48	48		301								Nikola	...	1																					
49	49		301								Nikola	If we're going to fight a war, we need to mobilize every resource we have, Hassen.	1																					
50	50		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Hassen	My thoughts exactly.	2
