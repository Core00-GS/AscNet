50	50		301									She begins to weep and takes out a smooshed piece of bread from her backpack, apparently handing it to the boy.

52	52		301									The boy is unable to respond now that he is a Corrupted.																						
53	53		301								Female Scavenger	But if Mommy didn't hand you to that Daedalus corporation... we would've all starved to death...	2																					
54	54		301									As she weeps, she becomes more heartbroken, but the boy still does not respond. Instead, he continues to walk slowly toward her.																						
55	55		301								Female Scavenger	I heard some soldiers say that... you were here on a mission... So I wanted to see you again...	2																					
56	56		301									Saying that, she wept quietly.

83	83		301								Female Scavenger	...Mommy just... just...	1																					
84	84		301									He thrusts his hand right through his mother's chest, causing blood to spew out of her mouth. She still fights through the agony to say her last words.

86	86		301								Female Scavenger	I wanted... to make us... a happy family...	1
