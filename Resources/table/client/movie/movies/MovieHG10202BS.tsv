5	6		301									As you move through the hallways, you stumble into Lucia, who seems to be looking for you.																						
6	7		301								Lucia	Sorry, Commandant... for running out on you earlier.	1																					
7	101		302								That's okay.	8	What happened back there?	9																				
8	8	10	301								Lucia	Thank you, Commandant.	1																					
9	9	10	301								Lucia	Just a small internal malfunction.	1																					
10	10		301								Lucia	It's hard to explain, but touching your hand seemed to accelerate this frame's heartbeat... Well, "heartbeat" might be an inaccurate term.	1																					
11	11		301								Lucia	That is, my M.I.N.D. was just overwhelmed by a wave of unknown fluctuations that didn't match with the memory data I have.	1																					
12	12		301								Lucia	These fluctuations did exist in the data from the previous frame, but they were flagged as errors and dismissed...	1																					
13	13		301								Lucia	...But I didn't expect the last flux to be so volatile. What came over me? Why did I suggest something like holding hands...?	1																					
14	14		301								Lucia	I don't think the old me ever said anything like that, right Commandant?	1																					
15	102		302								I think she did.	15	Don't think so...?	16																				
16	15	17	301								Lucia	H-huh... really? I can't seem to find the relevant logs... Unless you're toying with me, Commandant?	1																					
17	16	17	301								Lucia	I thought so too. Maybe it's a compiling error from reordering memory files.	1																					
18	17		301								Lucia	Though, to be honest, the more I try to adapt to the old me, the more distant I feel from her... hence, these strange actions I'm prone to.	1																					
19	18		301								Lucia	Holding hands was one of them. The incident with Karenina was another...	1																					
20	19		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	It went like this... I was on my way down to Tech for routine maintenance after a training session...	1

27	21		301								Karenina	I'm gonna beat you this time!	2																					
28	22		301								Lucia	Okay, sure.	1

35	25		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Lucia	I thought that responding to Karenina that way would satisfy her, but instead we stared daggers at each other for what felt like hours, until she finally had enough and left...	1																					
36	26		301								Lucia	So refusing her, just as I always had, was the right choice?	1																					
37	1000		302								Probably.	27	Do what you think is best.	28																				
38	27	300	301								Lucia	I see... I have much to learn about my companions.	1																					
39	28	300	301								Lucia	What I think is best... You never make it easy, do you, Commandant?	1																					
40	300		204							1	5																							
41	29		301								Lucia	But then I'll have to spend more time familiarizing myself with personality data that aren't yours, Commandant...	1																					
42	30		301								Lucia	Commandant, you're surrounded by so many... amazing people. If I don't hurry and become myself again, I might lose you forever...	1																					
43	31		301									Halfway through, Lucia seems to have entered into a world of her own and begins murmuring to herself—brows furrowed, lips pursed.																						
44	3111		302								I'm still here, Lucia. Not going anywhere...	32	That won't happen.	32																				
45	32		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Mh-hm, yeah... Why am I even worrying...? Hmm...	1
