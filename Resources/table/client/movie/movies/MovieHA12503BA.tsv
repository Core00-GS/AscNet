4	4		301									The girl's skirt glides past your outfit as she spins. The starry light in her eyes is brighter than the chandeliers on the dome.																						
5	5		301									As the music comes to an end, she takes a step back and makes a curtsy.																						
6	6		301									For the first time, you feel the dance music is so short.																						
7	7		301									The orchestra members rise to give their thanks. The conductor smiles at the applauding guests, then turns around and gestures the other members to get ready.																						
8	8		301									The conducting baton traces a silver arc, bringing out a lively, cheerful violin sonata.																						
9	9		301									Some guests walk off the dance floor as they chat, heading toward the tables with delicious food placed on them. Some smile at each other and start the next dance.

11	11		301							1	Iris	Shall we take a walk elsewhere?	1																					
12	12		302								Sure.	13																						
13	13		301									You follow her to a quieter corner, where you can see the outside of Eden through the window. The earth isn't visible on this side; only endless darkness and stars remain in vision.																						
14	14		301									The girl has her eyes closed. She tilts her head slightly as she listens to the music from afar. The violin sonata is as vibrant as young birds jumping and chirping on a branch.																						
15	15		301								Iris	"Gavotte en Rondeaux".	1																					
16	16		301								Iris	Have you ever heard that melody, 【kuroname】?	1																					
17	17		302								Yes.	18	Not really.	23																				
18	18		301									BMV 1006. It comes from a music suite created by a great composer of the Golden Age and is crowned the pinnacle of all Golden Age violin music.																						
19	19		302								But we don't have its complete version in the database.	20																						
20	20		301									Iris' eyes light up. She sounds more cheerful.																						
21	21		204							1	2																							
22	22	27	301								Iris	Correct.	1																					
23	23		302								I don't recall seeing it in the database.	24																						
24	24		302								Was it recently recycled by the Archaeological Team?	25																						
25	25		301								Iris	You are right.	1																					
26	26		301									There is a scent of shyness in her look, as if she is still not used to talking about her achievement as a member of the Archaeological Team.																						
27	27		204							1																								
28	28		301								Iris	I... The Archaeological Team managed to restore the complete piece using the data recycled during last mission. It is played in Babylonia for the first time in tonight's ball.	1																					
29	29		301								Iris	But it's more than that.	1																					
30	30		301								Iris	It has a special place in my heart because it was included in a very special record.	1																					
31	31		301									In the Golden Age, people would record music on a disc to play it. Such discs have long become obsolete. Together with murals and sculptures, they can only be found in the memories and fantasies about the good old days.																						
32	32		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Iris	It is called "Murmurs of Earth".	1

36	36		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Iris looks at the space outside as she tells the story.																						
37	37		301									It was the beginning of humans' journey to the stars. They put the sounds of Earth in a golden record to pay tribute to the vast space, and put it on a probe to sail toward the faraway galaxies.																						
38	38		301									The record also contained greetings in over fifty languages and images of Earth. It was a poem written by mother nature of the giant planet.																						
39	39		301									The erupting volcano and trembling earth. The wailing wind, pouring rain and roaring thunder.																						
40	40		301									Chirping insects, tweeting birds, howling wolves.																						
41	41		301									And a chronicle of the human civilization described by footsteps, humming machines and radio signals.																						
42	42		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					—As well as many monumental music pieces from different cultures. They are now being revived in Babylonia, the starting point to take back humanity's homeland.

45	45		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Iris	It could be a very trivial attempt to people nowadays.	1																					
46	46		301								Iris	Because the probe would only reach the nearest star in 40,000 years for a chance to be detected by any civilization that possibly exists there.	1																					
47	47		301								Iris	Be it the probe or us... We are too insignificant when facing the vast space and time.	1																					
48	48		301								Iris	But I was very touched when I learned about it.	1																					
49	49		301								Iris	"The launching of this 'bottle' into the cosmic 'ocean' says something very hopeful about life on this planet."	1																					
50	50		204							1																								
51	51		301								Iris	Back then, I just felt this was—incredibly romantic.	1																					
52	52		301									The last few words become soft as a sigh.																						
53	53		301								Iris	After becoming a Construct, I have seen another world that I never knew.	1																					
54	54		301								Iris	I'm always thinking... After going through all of this, am I able to describe the real world with my own hands?	1																					
55	55		301									The girl looks back at you, her long hair slipping down her shoulders.																						
56	56		301								Iris	All that beautiful art and culture we ever had... How can we let them disappear in history?	1																					
57	57		204							1	4																							
58	58		301								Iris	We were already reaching the stars in faraway space. It was the Punishing disaster that forced us to stop.	1																					
59	59		301								Iris	But...	1																					
60	60		302								But humanity will never stop venturing forward.	61																						
61	61		204							1																								
62	62		301									It slips out of your mouth.																						
63	63		301								Iris	Right. I am certain that humanity is walking on the path of hope, just like how that tiny drift bottle is still sailing in space.	1																					
64	64		301									You see a picture of a space probe, tiny as a grain of dust, going forward among the stars. It carries hope and never stops.																						
65	65		301									The lone traveler has long lost contact with Earth. You wonder where it is now?																						
66	66		301								Iris	Where has it gone now?	1																					
67	67		301									The girl mumbles the same question to herself.																						
68	68		301								Iris	Will another civilization discover it?	1																					
69	69		301								Iris	All the seeds of art it is carrying... Will they grow into new flowers on new land?	1																					
70	70		301									You cannot answer her questions.																						
71	71		301									The answer feels more distant than any other problem you are facing right now.																						
72	72		301								Iris	I know this sounds naive... But I truly believe there will be a day.	1																					
73	73		301								Iris	A day when it arrives at a new world, and we will return to our homeland and reunite with our friends. Together we will play new music and sing new songs.	1																					
74	74		301									The girl turns around, staring at you. Her iris eyes are glowing with more seriousness than ever.																						
75	75		204							1	4																							
76	76		301								Selena	【kuroname】, will someone hear me if I sing on the earth one day?	1																					
77	77		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Selena	—Will someone follow the song to find me?	1
