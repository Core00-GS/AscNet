3	3		301			DialogEnable						The Polyphage's silhouette becomes more apparent the further you follow Lamia down underground. The closer you are, the more its colossal size becomes evident, as well as the malevolence that seeps in.																						
4	4		301									Eventually, there is only a rift standing between the Polyphage and you. Below it, the Red Tide roils and crashes to the sides of the cliff.

7	7		301									The Punishing Virus crystalized under Lamia's command, forming a bridge that connects the rift, even if it only fits one person at a time.

11	11		301								Lamia	A small compliment wouldn't hurt... Did you see how hard I've been trying to help you?	1																					
12	12		301								Lee	I'm not buying it. There's no way you'll genuinely help us.	2																					
13	13		301								Lamia	Hehe, after all, I'm just a poor little fish in your leash. I'd do anything you tell me to.	1																					
14	14		301								Lamia	I'd rather live than be eaten alive by the Polyphage... Now that I've managed to escape.	1																					
15	15		302								Escape?	16

20	20		301								Lamia	Gabriel has never treated me as an equal... He wanted to feed all of us Ascendants to the Polyphage to give it enough power to destroy humankind.	1																					
21	21		301								Lamia	Well, I didn't want to be eaten... So I escaped.	1																					
22	22		301								Lamia	But consuming Miss Luna has given it more than enough power... Now we all get to be desserts...	1																					
23	23		302								How can we stop the Polyphage?	24																						
24	24		201							1	1031001	14																						
25	25		301							1	Liv	I'm afraid the only way is to get Luna out of there... Or...	1

29	29		301							1	Lucia	Lee, Liv, can you take Commandant back to the surface and call for reinforcement?	2																					
30	30		301								Lee	...Why?	1																					
31	31		301								Lucia	If you take Lamia with you, she should be able to help you bypass the signal blockade and reach Babylonia.	2																					
32	32		301								Lee	...Are you trying to get us out of here?	1

37	37		301							1	Lucia	Someone has to hold off the Polyphage. With how powerful it's become, it will be countless lives spared if I can just hold it back for a few seconds.	1																					
38	38		301								Lucia	Besides, Luna is still inside there. I...	1

42	42		301							1	Lee	Then we go together.	2																					
43	43		301								Lucia	...I'm the leader of Gray Raven. Doing so is too risky, and... irrational. I will not put Commandant and you in danger for my judgment.	1																					
44	44		302								That is why...	45																						
45	45		302								You need us.	46

48	48		301							1	Lee	Commandant's right. What's irrational is splitting up in the face of that.	1																					
49	49		301								Lee	If it were a strategic decision, I would have accepted it without question and given it my all.	1																					
50	50		301								Lee	But it's not the right move here, and you're clearly doing so because you thought this is just your burden to carry. I'm not going to allow that.	1																					
51	51		201							1	500166

57	57		301							1	Liv	Just like what Lee said, Lucia.	2																					
58	58		301								Liv	We still don't know our way around here. We could easily get into trouble on our way back.	2

67	67		301							1	Lamia	Hehe... Such a touching display of camaraderie! I'm so jealous!	1																					
68	68		301								Lamia	But I'm also pretty fed up.	1
