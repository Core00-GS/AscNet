5	5		301			DialogEnable				1	Roland	Gabriel, do you think Miss Luna has been acting quite strange recently?	1																					
6	6		301								Roland	She's even appearing on the battlefield.	1																					
7	7		301								Gabriel	Our leader appearing on the battlefield boosts troop morale. It shouldn't be considered strange.	2

11	11		301									With that, Roland picks up a stone and chucks it at a tree behind him.																						
12	12		301									The stone, however, does not connect with the tree. Instead, it stops midair.																						
13	13		301									Then, slowly, a hand grows out of the stone, slowly corporealizing into a body. Arm, torso, until the figure reveals itself coiling around the tree with several legs.

16	16		301							1	Lamia	Eeek...! Watch out! Why'd you throw at me!	2																					
17	8523		301								Roland	Reminds me, can she really handle it all by herself?	1																					
18	8524		301								Lamia	I-I guess...? She said we don't have to provide her with any support. We can just withdraw once we complete our mission...	2																					
19	8525		301								Roland	...Sounds like something she'd say.	1																					
20	17		301								Roland	You spend more time with Miss Luna than we do, don't you find it a bit off?	1																					
21	18		301								Lamia	N-no, not really... But I guess Miss Luna has been spending more time by herself than usual...	2																					
22	19		301								Roland	And you still don't find it strange, huh...	1																					
23	20		301								Lamia	B-but Miss Luna and Miss Alpha are just the same as ever...	2																					
24	21		301								Roland	...Oh, you're justâ€”Sigh.	1																					
25	22		301								Roland	I had you keep an eye on "her." Any news?	1																					
26	23		301								Lamia	Uh, well... You got nothing with a direct confrontation. What makes you think I'd have any updates...	2																					
27	24		301								Lamia	..."She" seems to be traveling aimlessly as usual.	2																					
28	25		204							1	4																							
29	26		301								Roland	...That's the dog that didn't bark, dear Watson.	1																					
30	27		301								Roland	Based on the signal we recently sent out in South America, "she" seems to be acting as if nothing happened.	1

34	31		301							1	Gabriel	Maybe she didn't catch the news.	3																					
35	32		301								Gabriel	As you know, ground relay is slower than it used to be.	3																					
36	33		301								Roland	Is there any possibility... that we've all been gravely mistaken?	1																					
37	34		301								Roland	What if "she" doesn't really care?	1																					
38	35		301								Gabriel	If so, then "she" is by no means a good agent.	3																					
39	36		301								Roland	Who stipulated that an agent must be loyal to their duty? Do you even know how agents are created?	1																					
40	37		301								Gabriel & Lamia	...	2	3																				
41	38		204							1																								
42	39		301								Roland	Look, even WE don't know. Non-agents know nothing about agents.	1																					
43	40		301								Roland	That's the issue.	1																					
44	41		301									Roland is about to continue, when Lamia points off into the distance.																						
45	42		301								Lamia	I-it's beginning...	2																					
46	43		301									Roland and Gabriel look to where Lamia is pointing and see the Arctic Route Union surrounded by an explosion of fire and smoke.																						
47	44		204							1	4																							
48	45		301								Roland	What's going on...? Wouldn't forcing them away achieve her goal already?	1																					
49	46		301								Lamia	Miss Luna... is trying to bring destruction upon them all.	2																					
50	47		301								Roland	This does not bode well. We've revealed our hand too early...	1																					
51	48		301								Roland	All while Babylonia and "she" still have their hands covered, we're forced to be on the passive.	1																					
52	49		301								Gabriel	Let us wait and consult with Miss Luna when she returns. Perhaps we no longer need to lurk in the dark.	3																					
53	50		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	Maybe, just maybe...	1

58	55		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	"421"	So, are you still going to side with them?	1																					
59	56		301									Shadows outstretched, the room is bathed in darkness. The robot looks over at a mysterious figure standing half-illuminated before it.																						
60	57		301									The shadowy figure lights a fire, leaving a fiery dot in the darkness, trailing with a puff of white smoke.																						
61	58		301								???	Indeed. This is all quite amusing.																						
62	59		301								???	And with the addition of Huaxu, this has become... all the more interesting.																						
63	60		301								"421"	If only I hadn't spared your life.	1																					
64	61		301								???	I'd say the same thing if I were you.																						
65	62		301								???	I'm sure me being alive has been quite the thorn in your side.																						
66	63		301								"421"	But as you know, I've never really cared about it. You're still of use to me now.	1																					
67	64		301								???	Useful to you? Or do you mean the two old guys above you?																						
68	65		301								"421"	You know I can't answer you that.	1																					
69	66		301								???	Never expected you to anyways.																						
70	67		301								"421"	So, what's with "Huaxu"?	1																					
71	68		301								???	What information do you have in exchange?																						
72	69		301								"421"	Enough intel to keep you away from the tip of Babylonia's spear in the coming days.	1																					
73	70		301								???	Fair enough. Let me ask you this... What purpose does "Huaxu" serve?																						
74	71		301								"421"	"Huaxu" is an AI. As for its purpose, that is for its owner to decide.	1																					
75	72		301								???	You're right. My point is, Huaxu may have a new master, but has her master... really changed?																						
76	73		301									The shadowy figure shakes their head and nods. The mechanical joints in their hands clench and loose. Finally, a few chuckles slide out of the speaker.																						
77	74		301								"421"	So... The plot thickens.	1																					
78	75		301								"421"	Last questionâ€”how big of a piece do you want of the pie?	1																					
79	76		301								???	Who said I only wanted a piece? What ifâ€”I want the whole pie?																						
80	77		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				"421"	You can certainly try...	1
