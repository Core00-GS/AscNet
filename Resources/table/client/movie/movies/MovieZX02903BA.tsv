159	159		301								Mom	You can stay here because I still have a job here, but when I'm gone, you'll have to leave and join the ranks of the Scavengers if you can't fend for yourself.	2																					
160	160		301								Mom	When that day comes... there will be no food, no shelter, and you might get infected anytime. When you want to rest, the Corrupted and robbers will swarm up to you.	2

177	177		301								???	Why do you sell your future?	1																					
178	178		301								Mom	To buy things that I otherwise can't afford.	2																					
179	179		301								Mom	For someone ordinary to become a hero, there is a steep price to pay, and it might even hurt those around you.	2

189	189		301									Without saying another word, she drags a tattered blanket over and puts it over the boy.

249	249		301								Lillian	My name is Lillian, by the way. They told me about your memory loss, and I'll be taking you to Medical Center 09 in a bit.	1																					
250	250		301								Young Man A	Medical Center 09? Someone from yesterday told me that I should go somewhere with better medical resources and get myself checked up and treated there, but they never said it's Medical Center 09.	2																					
251	251		301								Lillian	That's what they were talking about, because that's the only place around here with better medical resources. We'll be on our way when the transport vehicle is here.	1																					
252	252		301								Lillian	Have you recalled anything? Do you remember your name?	1																					
253	253		301								Young Man A	I've recalled a lot of things, except for my name...	2

257	257		301								Young Man A	What makes you say so?	2																					
258	258		301								Lillian	According to our instructor, you'll tend to have a harder time recalling something if you tried to shun it before the memory loss.	1																					
259	259		301								Lillian	That's probably what's happening to you now, I'm guessing.	1																					
260	260		204							2																								
261	261		301								Young Man A	...	2																					
262	262		301									Why would I try to shun my name, though?																						
263	263		301								Lillian	...Oops. Did I say something wrong?	1																					
264	264		301								Young Man A	No. I'm just feeling a little lost here.	2																					
265	265		301								Lillian	But you said you've recalled a lot of things already, right?	1																					
266	266		301								Young Man A	But they're all from before I was 12, and they all have to do with my family and friends, and...	2																					
267	267		301									...And the picture books and mangas I've read.

269	269		301								Young Man A	(But why am I remembering everything I've read...)	2																					
270	270		301								Lillian	Anything else?	1																					
271	271		204							2																								
272	272		301								Young Man A	Well, they're nothing worth mentioning.	2																					
273	273		301								Lillian	I bet they're just some of the bad things you've done.	1																					
274	274		204							2	11																							
275	275		301								Young Man A	...Unfortunately, no.	2																					
276	276		301								Young Man A	Just memories of some situation we couldn't work our way around, dreams I couldn't make happen, a nice aunt who would occasionally come to my rescue, and my mom who basically never told me a thing.	2																					
277	277		301								Lillian	Boy, those are lame with a capital L. I swear you'd be some guy if you were in a game.	1																					
278	278		204							2																								
279	279		301								Young Man A	I guess you're right... Say, do you think an ordinary person might just someday find himself on the wrong side of justice?	2																					
280	280		301								Lillian	...	1																					
281	281		301								Lillian	If anything, an ordinary person is exactly the type that would fall on the wrong side of justice, since they've got nothing that would help them land on the right side of it.	1
