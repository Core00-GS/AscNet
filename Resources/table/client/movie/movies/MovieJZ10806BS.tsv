7	6		301							1	Hassen	Take a seat. I wanted to talk about the retreat operation and some other news.	2																					
8	7		301								Watanabe	...There's no need.	1																					
9	8		301								Hassen	You have the right to know.	2																					
10	9		301								Watanabe	Are you worried that I know too much?	1

13	12		301								Hassen	...Our investigation shows Cyril was the leader of the Punishing Rebels. Not sure if he was the only leader, or if there were others.	2																					
14	13		301								Hassen	But we are certain that he had everything planned from the moment he approached the operation.	2																					
15	14		301								Hassen	They aren't a significant threat to Babylonia yet. But considering how little time they had to prepare, and how quickly they assembled with limited resources...	2																					
16	15		301								Hassen	And their ability to plan and execute such an ambush...	2																					
17	16		301								Hassen	All I can say is, thanks to you, we didn't lose Halcyon 2.	2																					
18	17		301								Hassen	That group mostly consists of ex-soldiers of the old government who aren't satisfied with the operation commands we have now. They have already left since Cyril exposed himself.	2																					
19	18		301								Hassen	We managed to kill or capture some of them, but a lot had escaped and are still active.	2																					
20	19		301								Hassen	If we do nothing, they may grow into a large threat.	2

24	23		301							1	Hassen	Seeing your contribution to the last operation, HQ decided to officially grant you access to Babylonia.	2																					
25	24		301								Hassen	You will be transferred to the Babylonia protection team and head to another launch base...	2

28	27		301							1	Watanabe	Actually, I also wanted to talk to you.	1																					
29	28		301								Hassen	Yes?	2																					
30	29		301								Watanabe	I would like to leave Babylonia.	1																					
31	30		301								Hassen	Watanabe? You know you will face a court-martial for that, don't you?	2																					
32	31		301								Watanabe	I've made up my mind. And you know, once I've decided to do something, nothing can stop me.	1																					
33	32		301								Hassen	I know.	2																					
34	33		301								Hassen	But why? Because of Cyril? Or...	2																					
35	34		301								Watanabe	Stop pretending like you care. I'm going to contact the ground military bases that have fallen out of the organization. Is that what you expected?	1																					
36	35		301								Hassen	...As a military man, I understand how you feel.	2																					
37	36		301								Watanabe	Well, I would kindly ask you for a favor then.	1																					
38	37		301								Hassen	But you do know Constructs are important assets of Babylonia, right?	2																					
39	38		301								Watanabe	...	1																					
40	39		301								Watanabe	I know there's one shuttle heading to the ground today, shipping "scrapped" Constructs.	1																					
41	40		301								Watanabe	As for your "asset"... I will return it to where it came from.	1																					
42	41		301								Watanabe	But you probably know about my very first frame.	1																					
43	42		301								Hassen	...That frame will allow you to easily enter the shuttle without being discovered.	2																					
44	43		301								Hassen	(Lets out a bitter smile) But you know I wasn't talking about the frames.	2																					
45	44		301								Hassen	Anyway, I understand. Last but not least...	2

48	47		301								Hassen	Watanabe, on behalf of Babylonia, I would like to thank you for all you have done.	2																					
49	48		301								Hassen	Thank you for your service for Babylonia and the entire humanity.	2																					
50	49		201							2	500080																							
51	50		301							1	Watanabe	...	2																					
52	51		201							2	500011																							
53	52		301							1	Hassen	Well... Till we meet again.	2																					
54	53		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Hassen	I hope that we're both alive till then.	2
