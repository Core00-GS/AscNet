10	10		301								Kamui	I know we're looking for them, but are we going to do that on foot? We're pretty far from the target location. Should we ask Babylonia to airdrop a vehicle? That'll get us there sooner.	1																					
11	11		301								Wanshi	Vehicles won't do well on these roads.	2																					
12	12		301								Kamui	Why not? These roads are wide enough.	1

21	20		301								Kamui	That's ridiculous! It's at least three meters tall!	2																					
22	21		301								Wanshi	Well, we don't have to look for it anymore. Even though our mission priority has changed, we still have time to get a sample.	3																					
23	22		301								Chrome	Yeah. Let's find a vantage point before the Red Tide gets here.	1																					
24	23		301								Kamui	I have to say... that thing looks so... gross. I don't want to be anywhere near it.	2																					
25	24		301								Chrome	According to Asimov's initial analysis, it's a combination of the Punishing Virus with certain "impurities."	1																					
26	25		301								Kamui	Look at the concentration of Punishing Virus. I don't think anyone would dare to get close to it unless they're as special as Camu...	2																					
27	26		301								Wanshi	Why don't you ask Camu to check it out?	3																					
28	27		301								Kamui	He accepted a mission as a freelancer, so we separated before I landed.	2
