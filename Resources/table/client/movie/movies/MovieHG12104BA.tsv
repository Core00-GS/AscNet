3	3		301			DialogEnable						Separated by a glass pane, you see No. 21 getting ready for combat simulation in the next room.																						
4	4		301									Cables of various colors are connected to No. 21's neck and joints, linking her to the terminal. The small white Construct lies motionless on the cold metal bed as if used to the procedure.																						
5	5		301									Like a broken and hollow doll, the scene reminds you of what you witnessed in her pure white M.I.N.D.																						
6	6		302								...	7	Is this really necessary?	7

8	8		301							1	Technician	We'll just be collecting data. No need to be nervous.	1																					
9	9		301								Technician	Are you her commandant?	1																					
10	10		302								...No.	11	...For the time being.	12																				
11	11	13	301								Technician	Huh?	1																					
12	12		301								Technician	...They can assign temporary commandants?	1																					
13	13		301									The technician in charge of calibrating the equipment raises her head from the complex array of equipment and gives you a bewildered look.																						
14	14		301								Technician	In terms of training... It seems that you volunteered to work together during the combat simulation. I figured only appointed commandants would do that for their team members.	1																					
15	15		301								Technician	Not to mention... She's a member of the remote link team. No wonder they're so anxious to replace her.	1																					
16	16		301								Technician	...If she's not fully operational... It's going to be the same no matter where she is.	1																					
17	17		301									The technician's last sentence is quiet, as if an ambivalent sigh to herself, and it gets lost in the rumbling noise of the machines.																						
18	18		302								Sorry?	19																						
19	19		301								Technician	Nothing. Don't worry about it.	1																					
20	20		301								Technician	Once a Construct's M.I.N.D. begins to deviate in battle, it may cause irreversible cognitive damage to the link team's commandant. I'm sure a remote link is no exception.	1																					
21	21		301								Technician	I don't know if you're too confident or too ignorant for accepting this mission... Let alone sign your name on the liability statement.	1																					
22	22		302								That's because I believe in her.	23	I've linked with a Transcendant. This is nothing.	24																				
23	23	26	301								Technician	...You sure are strange.	1																					
24	24		301								Technician	A Transcend... Ah! You're the Gray Raven Commandant... No wonder...	1																					
25	25		302								Why are you acting like it all makes sense now?	26																						
26	26		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Technician	I've finished preparing all the equipment. Let's begin.	1

32	32		302								...How do you feel, No. 21?	33																						
33	33		301								No. 21	...Nothing out of the ordinary.	1																					
34	34		301									After both of you quickly finish collecting data, No. 21 is let out of the room.																						
35	35		301									While maintaining the link, you scan her vitals to ensure that her frame is still stable.																						
36	36		301									It's just that...																						
37	37		302								Sorry for bringing up bad memories.	40	Are you afraid?	38																				
38	38		202							1					1																			
39	39		301									No. 21 shakes her head quietly.

41	41		301							1	No. 21	Are they going to discard me?	1																					
42	42		302								Sorry?	43																						
43	43		301								No. 21	I've... seen it happen before.	1																					
44	44		301								No. 21	Constructs that don't meet the standard and can't complete missions are discarded.	1																					
45	45		301								No. 21	It's been a long time since I've had a mission.	1																					
46	46		301								No. 21	Is it because I can't control myself?	1																					
47	47		302								No, it's...	49																						
48	48		204							1	3																							
49	49		301								No. 21	I don't know what to do. These emotions... are so strange to me.	1																					
50	50		301								No. 21	I didn't like them at first. They weren't mine.	1																					
51	51		301								No. 21	But I want to have emotions. That way I'll have the scent of a human. I want the scent of humans.	1																					
52	52		301									Searching for and putting together these unfamiliar words, No. 21's breath begins to quicken, and she tries her best to express her thoughts.																						
53	53		301								No. 21	That's why I started to feel my own emotions.	1																					
54	54		301								No. 21	Those belong to me. They're mine. I worked so hard to have them.	1																					
55	55		301				DialogDisable				No. 21	But if I can't fight because of emotions... Even if they want to throw me away, I'll...	1																					
56	56		302								I won't let that happen.	57																						
57	57		302								Vera won't let you get kicked out of Cerberus. Neither will I.	58																						
58	58		302								Expressing your emotions is normal.	59																						
59	59		302								You're just not used to it.	60

63	63		302								I think so.	64																						
64	64		302								I'll help you.	65																						
65	65		302								I'll be with you for follow-up combat simulations.	66
