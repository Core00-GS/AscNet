3	3		301			DialogEnable						It is late in the night. While Constructs are all equipped with night vision, the besieged soldiers still feel like danger is approaching out of their instinct.																						
4	4		301									Danger, subsequently, spreads anxiety...

7	7		301							1	Construct Soldier	Captain, did Lloyd really flee from battle...?	1																					
8	8		301								Construct Captain	Shut up! Lloyd will never betray us. He... must be trying to get us some reinforcements.	2																					
9	9		301									The Captain tells them off, but his voice is apparently faltering.

12	12		301							1	Injured Construct	Captain! More Corrupted... in the east! They have come again.	1

14	14		201							2	500028		400																					
15	15		301							1	Construct Captain	Those of you who are still able to fight, grab your weapons and follow me... We must hold on until Lloyd comes back.	2																					
16	16		301									The soldiers mechanically pick up their weapons and follow the order. But they all know that this time, the hero may not return to save them.																						
17	17		301									Suddenly, a soldier's eyes widen as he sees real despair.																						
18	18		301								Construct Soldier	Captain...! The Corrupted have crossed the traps on the other side of the woods. We are surrounded!	1																					
19	19		202							1	2				1																			
20	20		301									One after another, the Corrupted appear from behind the bushes, completely encircling the Construct troops.																						
21	21		201							1	500250																							
22	22		301							1	Injured Construct	Aargh...!	1																					
23	23		301									The Corrupted swarm to the injured soldier as she becomes their first target, leaving no time for the other Construct soldiers to help.

26	26		301							1	Corrupted	Rargh!!!!!	1																					
27	27		301			PanelActor1Shake						But just before they tear the soldier apart, a sharp spear pierces through the head of the Corrupted and impales it to the ground.																						
28	28		202							1	2				1																			
29	29		301									The rest of the Corrupted are slightly stunned. Even when they are only acting on instinct, they can still feel that the Construct in front of them is the biggest threat.

35	35		301									The injured soldier quickly rolls away before Vera's banner spear thrusts toward her direction, narrowly grazing her face while piercing another Corrupted behind.

37	37		301							1	Vera	Oops, sorry. I almost mistook you for the Corrupted.	1

39	39		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Vera pulls out her spear and tosses the Corrupted away, knocking back another Corrupted that is charging forward. When it tries to get up, Vera stomps its head to pieces.

41	42		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Vera	Listen up! I've got good news for you. The Lloyd you are waiting for has fled from the battlefield. He is not coming back!																						
42	43		301								Construct Captain	"The Undying Loy" will never leave us behind...!																						
43	44		301								Vera	Hah, "Undying" my ***! Here, do you recognize this spear?																						
44	45		301								Construct Soldier	Captain! She's holding Lloyd's banner spear...!																						
45	46		301								Construct Captain	Why do you have his spear?																						
46	47		301								Vera	Because I was the one who killed him. This spear speaks for itself!																						
47	48		301								Vera	He was slightly smarter than you, but he made a wrong decision. If only he chose to die with you, I wouldn't have needed to kill him myself.																						
48	49		301								Construct Captain	No way...																						
49	50		301									The Corrupted are closing in once again. Vera looks at them with a playful grin.																						
50	51		301								Vera	But it wouldn't make any difference. You are going to die here anyway...																						
51	52		301									The Constructs know they stand no chance against such a vast number of Corrupted. No matter how hard they fight, they won't make it out of this siege.																						
52	53		301								Construct Soldier	Lloyd is dead... We are doomed...																						
53	54		301								Injured Construct	Right, recall! Let's just recall so we can live! Just like Lloyd always did!																						
54	55		301									As the soldiers begin to panic, their defense starts to falter. One soldier has completely lost the will to fight and abandoned his weapon, no longer reacting to the Corrupted's attack.																						
55	56		301									But just before the Corrupted's claws pierce through the soldier, it is impaled by Vera's banner spear.																						
56	57		301								Vera	Useless fools! Can't you do anything yourselves without Lloyd to rely on?!																						
57	58		301									Vera raises the banner on her spear so everyone can see her and hear her voice.																						
58	59		301								Vera	The fact that I killed him means I am stronger. I can do things that he cannot. My flag has not fallen, and my spear is still sharp!																						
59	60		301								Vera	Look at you, cowards. How laughable! Only losers will put their hope on recalling. I can break through these weak Corrupted alone and return to Babylonia alive!																						
60	61		301								Vera	But if you, any of you, still have at least one bit of ego left in your faint-hearted mind, then follow his banner and march forward!																						
61	62		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Vera flips the banner spear wildly and cuts the Corrupted near her in half with one mighty swing. The encirclement suddenly has a small opening.

71	71		301									The injured Construct slowly stands up again, pulling out her worn blade.																						
72	72		301								Injured Construct	She's right. She may actually get us out of here.	1

78	78		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Many soldiers are still hesitating, but more have clenched their weapons. With their broken bodies, they launch a final charge following the waving banner.
