8	8		301								Liv	That's right, Lee and I can both support you with ranged attacks, so you can make use of your explosive capabilities to get through!	2

12	12		301							1	Lucia	In that case, I'll be counting on you.	1

14	14		302								No problem.	15	Easy-peasy.	15

16	16		301									You tap your chest with your hand in a laid-back manner, giving her your approval. Lucia nods at your response, then readjusts her grip on her katana.

28	28		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						While Alpha clashes with Gabriel, Roland arrives at an underground area on the other side of the Core Area.																						
29	29		301									The Hetero-Creatures standing in his way attack the sudden invader, only to be crushed into pieces by Roland's glistening chain blade.																						
30	30		201							1	500008	3																						
31	31		301							1	Roland	...Cough.	1																					
32	32		301									Roland spits out the vital fluid stuck in his throat, silently watching the silent monster standing in front of him.																						
33	33		201							1	500248																							
34	34		301							1	Ashen Hetero-Creature	...	1																					
35	35		201							1	500008																							
36	36		301							1	Roland	Oh, here you are. Gabriel's hidden you here, as expected.	1																					
37	37		301								Roland	Alpha's stalling Gabriel, so I took the opportunity to locate this place. I wonder how it's going there.	1																					
38	38		204							1	4																							
39	39		301								Roland	Well, now's not the time to worry.	1																					
40	40		301									The ashen Hetero-Creature floats slightly above the ground, quiet and still, looking almost like a statue.																						
41	41		204							1	3																							
42	42		301								Roland	Even though he doesn't trust me completely... I've managed to get enough information from Gabriel to find out where you're staying.	1																					
43	43		301								Roland	He's a cautious sort of guy, not the kind of person who'd only have one control terminal for the Polyphage. You're his insurance policy.	1																					
44	44		301								Roland	Luckily, I've been keeping tabs on him. Otherwise, no one's gonna know you're here except for him.	1																					
45	45		301								Roland	Right. I imagine the Gray Ravens have encountered the other "you" that's guarding Luna by now.	1																					
46	46		204							1	4																							
47	47		301								Roland	Or your "sister"? Do your species call each other human names?	1																					
48	48		204							1	3																							
49	49		301								Roland	Well, it doesn't matter. What matters is you're "symbiotic" with the Polyphage.	1																					
50	50		301								Roland	If I destroy you here, the Polyphage will fall into a brief moment of disarray from losing one of the terminals. I'm guessing your "sister" will be affected too.	1																					
51	51		301								Roland	I'm not sure how big an impact this will make, nor do I know if Gray Raven will manage to seize the opportunity...	1																					
52	52		301									Roland draws his weapon, and the Hetero-Creature across him immediately spreads its wings, its eyes blinking a menacing red as if it has detected a threat.																						
53	53		204							1	5																							
54	54		301								Roland	So, this is how it is... You don't even hesitate to fight me as soon as I show a little bit of aggression, even if I'm an Ascendant. I watched you grow up, for crying out loud! I wouldn't mind a little respect.	1																					
55	55		301								Roland	I know it won't be easy taking you down, but I think I'm ready.	1																					
56	56		204							1	2																							
57	57		301								Roland	So, while your "sister" is having fun with the Gray Ravens, we can have our own little dance.	1																					
58	58		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	You pathetic creature.	1
