8	8		301								Roland	This whole situation is too bizarre. It wouldn't have ended this fast even with Luna on the field herself.	1																					
9	9		301								Gabriel	Don't you believe in Miss Luna's power?	2																					
10	10		301								Roland	No, if this was a full frontal assault, no one would've been able to stand up to her.	1																					
11	11		301								Roland	But this was not the case. People would've hid and fled in all directions. It would've taken some time to find them if she was just by herself.	1																					
12	12		301								Roland	Just like Lamiaâ€”	1

27	27		301								Gabriel	What's peculiar about a snatch and grab?	2																					
28	28		202							1	2				1																			
29	29		301									Not wanting to continue the conversation with Roland, Gabriel turns to leave. Likewise, Lamia recedes back into the shadows.

34	34		301								Roland	If it was just me and you, what would've happened?	1																					
35	35		301								Gabriel	We take what Miss Luna wanted and leave. That's all.	2																					
36	36		204							1																								
37	37		301								Roland	Exactly. "That's all."	1																					
38	38		301								Roland	Infiltrate the Route Union, take what we wanted, and leave. All without alerting anyone of our presence.	1																					
39	39		301								Gabriel	...	2																					
40	40		301								Roland	If Miss Luna wanted to destroy the Route Union, she would've done it more thoroughly.	1																					
41	41		301								Roland	She's left so many people alive, each person could be trouble down the line.	1																					
42	42		301								Roland	Luna's actions couldn't have been for a mission... Understand?	1																					
43	43		301								Roland	Not to mention, this isn't the first time she's held back.	1																					
44	44		301								Gabriel	...	2																					
45	45		301								Roland	It's just like last time. She had Alpha sparing that guy instead of killing him as if that'd scare him straight. And then what happened?	1																					
46	46		301								Gabriel	What are you trying to say?	2																					
47	47		301								Roland	Would a qualified agent leave loose ends like this?	1																					
48	48		301									Gabriel musters up a sneer through his vocalizer covered in heavy cloth and continues walking forward, despite Roland standing in the way.																						
49	49		301								Roland	Hey, where do you think you're going?	1																					
50	50		301								Gabriel	Preparations need to be made.	2																					
51	51		301								Roland	Really? Need a hand?	1																					
52	52		301								Gabriel	That won't be necessary. It's just some trivial matters.	2																					
53	53		301								Roland	Nonsense. You've been unusually busy recently. You must be up to something big.	1																					
54	54		301								Gabriel	If you want to complain about not having enough work, just spit it out already.	2																					
55	55		301								Roland	No, no. That's not what I meant.	1																					
56	56		301									Seeing Roland's persistence, Gabriel stops in his tracks.																						
57	57		301								Gabriel	It's "feeding" time.	2																					
58	58		301								Roland	Huh? You sure seem attached to it.	1																					
59	59		301								Gabriel	Someone who talks to skeletons everyday says I'm attached?	2																					
60	60		301									Unable to see Gabriel's face behind his metal face mask, Roland felt a mixture of delight and contempt from him.																						
61	61		301								Gabriel	Now it's the only thing I care about.	2																					
62	62		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Gabriel	Humanity's worst nightmare has finally come to life. We must see to it that raise it right.	2

71	71		301								Î±	"Stupid things as always" wouldn't make you have that expression. Does it have anything to do with what Huaxu showed you?	1

79	79		301							1		Alpha remains silent for a moment. Obviously, she knows what Luna meant by her past.

83	83		301							1	Luna	You don't need to worry about me, Sister.	1

86	86		301							1	Î±	I wouldn't state the obvious.	1

94	94		301								Luna	I'm only interested in uprooting all that I hate.	1																					
95	95		301								Luna	No matter if my actions benefit others, they will never thank me. But, I've never sought humanity's gratitude.	1
