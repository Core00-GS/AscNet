8	8		301							1	Vera	Don't cry on the ground. Man up a little, will you? How's the potion collection going, Camu, Karenina?	1																					
9	9		301								Karenina	Why are you the one giving orders?!	2																					
10	10		301									After learning that recovery potions could make the trip a lot easier, Vera started collecting them from every household.																						
11	1001		302								This is way too much.	11	Don't we already have more than enough?	12																				
12	11	13	301								Vera	Is that sympathy from you? I knew you were a doormat long ago...	1																					
13	12	13	301								Vera	It's the more the merrier when it comes to potions. Who knows what will happen next?	1																					
14	13		301								Vera	We didn't take anything other than recovery potions. No money, no weapon, nothing valuable at all. I say we are actually very good people.	1																					
15	14		301								Camu	No. We are no different from the bandits.	3																					
16	15		301								Vera	Bandits take things without paying, but Karenina left some money in every home. Well, we didn't know how much exactly we should pay, but at least we paid. 	1																					
17	16		301								Karenina	When did you notice?!	2																					
18	17		301								Vera	Oh Karenina, you can never be a bad guy.	1																					
19	18		301								Karenina	I never wanted to!	2																					
20	19		301									Camu and Karenina soon returned with lots of recovery potions. Vera then divided them in half and put them into her own bag and Karenina's bag.																						
21	20		301								Vera	Good, now let's move to the next village.	1																					
22	1002		302								Are we still doing this?	21	Aren't we supposed to go for the Demon Generals?	22																				
23	21		301								Vera	Of course. I can heal, so I don't really need potions myself, but I just love taking things away from others.	1																					
24	22		301								Vera	The Demon General's Castle is just after the next village. Whether you like it or not, we will go through that village regardless.	1

30	24		301							1	Vera	I don't mind you calling us minions, but at least show some respect for your King.	1																					
31	25		301									Just when Vera was about to leave with the team, a few guard robots from the village stopped them, trying to take revenge on the team for justice.

33	26		301							1	Villager	The King is only interested in his weird experiments. He had done nothing except killing Demons!	1
