9	9		301									Roland turns around and looks at the scorched earth behind him. Perhaps a group of Hetero-Creatures or some powerful Corrupted swept across this crimson land, destroying everything but this small notebook.																						
10	10		301									Finding a burnt tree trunk, Roland sits down and tears off a piece of blank paper from the book. After some thought, he quietly places a small object above the paper before folding it...																						
11	11		301									A girl walks out of the shadow, curious about how Roland keeps folding the paper in his hand.

15	15		204							1	1																							
16	16		301									Roland smiles and gives the paper one final press before standing it up on a burnt branch in front of him—it is an origami rabbit.																						
17	17		301								Roland	Can't you tell...? It's a rabbit. Do you know what a rabbit is?	1																					
18	18		301									Cinderelik looks at the paper bunny and frowns.																						
19	19		301								Cinderelik	I know what it is, but is this a rabbit...?	2																					
20	20		301								Roland	I think I did a pretty good job. It's small and white with big eyes and long ears... Isn't it adorable?	1																					
21	21		301								Cinderelik	Adorable... How can a creature so weak be adorable? I don't understand why you made it.	2																					
22	22		301									Roland stands up from his tree trunk and stretches.																						
23	23		301								Roland	Maybe... I was bored.	1																					
24	24		301									Cinderelik has no idea what the man before her is thinking, but she does not need to know. It was Mister's idea to keep him with them, and Mister is never wrong.																						
25	25		301								Cinderelik	Mister is looking for you. Come... He told me it's your reward.	2																					
26	26		204							1																								
27	27		301									Roland's gaze shifts just a little bit, his expression remaining the same as if he is performing the role he has always been playing with ease—someone whose thought is inscrutable.																						
28	28		204							1	1																							
29	29		301								Roland	Oh? Well, then, I should probably go and claim it quickly.	1

43	43		301							1	Roland	Hello, Mr. Vonnegut. It seems like you haven't forgotten our deal.	1																					
44	44		301								Vonnegut	Of course not. A fair exchange is key to any partnership. Your work has earned you your reward.	2																					
45	45		301									Roland smiles and gives Vonnegut a gentleman's bow.																						
46	46		301								Roland	Don't mention it. It was what I do best... Still, I can't help but wonder about the two... monsters created by the Hetero-Hive Mother. It took so much effort, but Babylonia's new weapon seems to have kept them at bay.	1																					
47	47		301								Vonnegut	That is arguably the best answer humans can come up with given how desperate they are... After all, they do possess an ace up their sleeve.	2																					
48	48		301									Vonnegut looks at Roland, awaiting his reaction.																						
49	49		301								Roland	Ha... so they do have Luna with them. That would explain why they didn't kill her. The secrets one can learn from an agent are too valuable.	1																					
50	50		301								Vonnegut	But they certainly haven't learned all of them. Otherwise, they wouldn't have created that imperfect Construct—but the more they learn, the closer they are to their demise.	2																					
51	51		301									Roland shrugs, unconcerned. He leans on a random tree that looks steady enough, asking the question he cares about the most while pretending to be indifferent.																						
52	52		301								Roland	So—our dearest Luna... Where is she?	1																					
53	53		301									Vonnegut seems to have expected Roland's question, and he has an answer prepared.																						
54	54		301								Vonnegut	Luna is kept by humans in a place we can see but cannot touch.	2																					
55	55		204							1	7																							
56	56		301								Roland	What is that? A riddle...? Sigh. I wasn't expecting you to make it difficult for me... Wait a minute...	1																					
57	57		301									Roland quickly realizes that what Vonnegut said was not a riddle but a fact—a fact Roland sees every day but ignores.																						
58	58		301									Roland looks to the sky. The Moon shines, casting light on his face.																						
59	59		301								Roland	The Moon... Luna is on the Moon?	1																					
60	60		301									Pleased, Vonnegut nods and turns his gaze toward the Moon as well.																						
61	61		301								Vonnegut	She is currently locked inside Babylonia's lunar base. It was once a research center for Babylonia's main engine.	2																					
62	62		301								Vonnegut	And now, people have restarted the zero-point reactor there, using it to create the "Omega Weapons" that are lethal to the Punishing Virus.	2																					
63	63		204							1	1																							
64	64		301									Roland rubs his chin and ponders. He glances toward Cinderelik on the side and smirks, having come up with an idea.																						
65	65		301								Roland	I don't know how you find out about this information, and I have no way to prove it. If you say Luna was under the Mariana Trench, I wouldn't be able to go there either. Isn't that right?	1																					
66	66		201							1	500308		-400																					
67	67		301							1	Cinderelik	Mister won't lie to you. If he says she's on the Moon, then Luna is on the Moon. As for how you get there...	1																					
68	68		301									Cinderelik takes a look at Vonnegut, and he nods in return.																						
69	69		301								Vonnegut	Voodoo... Maybe you should explain.	2																					
70	70		202							1	2				1																			
71	71		301									Right as he says that, a large shadow shrouds the three of them above their heads. The figure who eventually lands is the Transcendant "Voodoo".

87	87		301							1		Voodoo's voice suddenly becomes metallic and sharp. There seems to be some form of personality breakdown due to the M.I.N.D. defect of a humanoid-hybrid Construct.																						
88	88		301								Voodoo	There is an intact space shuttle underneath the ruins of that city. Those people are trying to board it to return to Babylonia—I believe that model is capable of traveling to the Moon.	1																					
89	89		201							1	500334																							
90	90		301							1	Roland	I see. If we can get to the ship first, we can easily go for a joyride to the Moon.	1																					
91	91		301									Vonnegut turns back toward Roland. Roland cannot tell how Vonnegut feels underneath his mask.																						
92	92		201							1	500305																							
93	93		301							1	Vonnegut	Luna is currently blocked by the Ascension-Network. She has lost the power of an agent, but not her status as one... It is a most peculiar situation.	1																					
94	94		301								Vonnegut	Her survival has certainly given humans an opportunity to cheat, which would hinder the Ascension-Network. That is why I want you to rescue Luna from the humans. And if she can't be saved...	1																					
95	95		301									Vonnegut nods at Cinderelik, signaling her to take out the prepared sealed case.																						
96	96		301								Vonnegut	Luna cannot be allowed to exist—not her body, not her mind, not even the idea of her.	1																					
97	97		301									Roland takes the case and opens it. Inside, he finds a container that is filled with crimson liquid, within which submerges a slice of constantly-mutation pale flesh.																						
98	98		201							1	500308																							
99	99		301							1	Cinderelik	This is the remaining stem cell of the Hetero-Hive Mother who birthed the twins. It can grow infinitely by devouring all kinds of matter and energy.	1																					
100	100		201							1	500305																							
101	101		301							1	Vonnegut	An unexpected byproduct, I'd say. It's not very intelligent, but it can tell friends from foes when controlled. That's good enough.	1																					
102	102		201							1	500334																							
103	103		301							1	Roland	You want me to use this thing to remove Luna?	1																					
104	104		201							1	500305																							
105	105		301							1	Vonnegut	You're correct. When you believe you cannot save her, or...	1																					
106	106		301									Vonnegut's golden pupils stare straight at Roland as he stresses his remaining words.																						
107	107		301								Vonnegut	...when you believe Luna, as an agent, is no longer worth saving.	1																					
108	108		301									Roland chuckles, putting the container back inside before holding the case.																						
109	109		201							1	500334																							
110	110		301							1	Roland	When do I leave, then?	1
