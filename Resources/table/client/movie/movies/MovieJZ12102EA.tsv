3	3		301			DialogEnable						The Co-Bot attached firmly to the glass begins to move. A purple beam of light fires from the laser cannon floating behind No. 21, shattering the ballistic glass.																						
4	4		301									Even though Kurono boasts an impeccable defense system, it is powerless in stopping the ashen monster that they have built.																						
5	5		201							1	500344																							
6	6		301									The white Construct leaps over the shattered glass like a leopard and lands on top of the console.																						
7	7		301									She squats down on the giant, intricate machine. The Co-Bot climbs along the ceiling and returns to her side like a wild beast that only responds to her commands.																						
8	8		301							1	Kurono Leader	Hurry... Yarha! Do something! Don't just stand there!																						
9	9		301								Yarha	...																						
10	10		301									Yarha remains sitting on the ground, unable to respond.																						
11	11		301									To hell with his leader. To hell with Kurono.																						
12	12		301									His mouth half-opened, he sees his creation from this close for the first time. He trembles, partly out of fear, but mostly out of...																						
13	13		301									Admiration.

15	15		301							1		As if born from white oblivion, the girl radiates a menacing aura like that of a ferocious beast—immaculate and dangerous.	1																					
16	16		301									She is like a living creature... Of course, she was human, after all. However, regardless of her past experiences or the broken, lifeless frame that was sent to him, she is different now. She has fully awakened.	1																					
17	17		301								No. 21	...	1																					
18	18		301									No. 21 stands up and jumps down from the console.																						
19	19		201							1	500058																							
20	20		301			PanelActor1Shake				1	Yarha	Ah...!	1																					
21	21		301									Yarha trembles and shuffles back in fear, closing his eyes.																						
22	22		301									But No. 21 just stands there, looking at her surroundings.																						
23	23		201							1	500328																							
24	24		401							1	36																							
25	25		301							1	No. 21	What is it?	1																					
26	26		201							1	500058																							
27	27		301							1	Yarha	...	1																					
28	28		301									Her voice is a lot softer than what Yarha has imagined. She speaks gently as if she is worried about waking someone up.																						
29	29		301									Opening his eyes, Yarha sees her touching the control panel before looking his way.																						
30	30		201							1	500328																							
31	31		301							1	No. 21	So many buttons. What is it?	1																					
32	32		204							1	4																							
33	33		301								No. 21	Who are you people?	1																					
34	34		401							2	1516																							
35	35		301									No. 21 repeats her question. She steps over Yarha and walks forward. The Kurono leader trembles before her.																						
36	36		301									Calming down, No .21 stops and looks at the others with only vigilance and curiosity in her eyes, just like a newborn beast.																						
37	37		301								No. 21	Are you researchers?	1																					
38	38		201							1	500058																							
39	39		301							1	Yarha	...Eh—yes. That's correct.	1																					
40	40		201							1	500328																							
41	41		301							1	No. 21	I have a new body. Did you do that?	1

43	43		201							2	500202		400																					
44	44		301							1	Kurono Leader	...Y-yes! We did. Now you have to obey our orders, so stop right there. Don't come any closer.	2																					
45	45		301								Yarha	I was the one who did it. I developed your new frame.	1

47	47		201							1	500328																							
48	48		301							1	No. 21	Oh.	1																					
49	49		301									To their surprise, No. 21 remains where she stands.																						
50	50		301									Yarha's mouth becomes parched. He was not expecting No. 21 to be so "obedient."																						
51	51		201							1	500058		-400																					
52	52		201							2	500202		400

54	54		301							1	Kurono Leader	This... This really is...	2																					
55	55		301									The Kurono leader stands up and pats the dust off his suit. His calm and confident executive demeanor returns.																						
56	56		301								Kurono Leader	This is really incredible. I didn't expect there to be this much potential hidden in Daedalus' research division... Is this the humanoid weapon they have been working on?	2																					
57	57		301								Kurono Leader	Nicely done, Yarha. Is this the only one you recovered?	2																					
58	58		301								Yarha	...Yes. I supervised the recovery mission. The other test subjects seemed to either fail the modification surgeries or the field tests for various reasons... But, uh... Vera found her during the mission. She was still undergoing modification at the time.	1																					
59	59		301								Kurono Leader	Fortunately, they stopped halfway. Those imbeciles at Daedalus didn't have the technical capabilities for conducting such a precise operation.	2																					
60	60		301								Yarha	...I agree.	1																					
61	61		301								Kurono Leader	She's not ready to be sent on missions, though. We can't have her going berserk like she did just now. All Kurono Constructs must learn to obey orders no matter what.	2																					
62	62		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Kurono Leader	I have an idea. You said Vera brought her back. Correct?	2
