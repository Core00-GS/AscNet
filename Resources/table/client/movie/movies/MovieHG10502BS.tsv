13	13		301								Lee	By the way, Commandant, did you know that Nanami designed and built that new frame herself?	1																					
14	14		302								She made it herself?	15	It's quite useful in battle.																					
15	15		301								Lee	I was there when she built it, even though I thought she was just messing around at first.	1																					
16	16		301								Lee	But why would she decide to make a frame?	1

26	26	28	301								Lee	Nothing. I already did multiple reverse positioning and filtered checks.	1																					
27	27		301								Lee	That's just what we think. Officially, the team only consists of me, Lucia, and Liv.	1																					
28	28		301								Lee	But now that you mention it, it really makes one wonder... Even though she decided to stay now.	1
