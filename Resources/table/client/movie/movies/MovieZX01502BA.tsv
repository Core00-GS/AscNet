10	10		301								Director	I didn't say you did...	2

12	12		204							1	1																							
13	13		301								Changyu	Oof... (Guilty)	1																					
14	14		301									The director grabs Changyu by the arm.																						
15	15		301								Director	Regardless if you did something illegal or not, you always go around jumping over rooftops.	2																					
16	16		301								Changyu	I did no such thing! I just fell is all!	1																					
17	17		301								Director	...Wait here. I'll go find you a tetanus shot.	2																					
18	18		204							1	14																							
19	19		301								Changyu	Ol' man, no! We don't have the money to buy another shot!	1																					
20	20		301								Director	If you already knew that, then why'd you go off and be so reckless?	2																					
21	21		301								Director	Your food money for the second half of the month is all going to roofing repairs for your victims!	2																					
22	22		204							1	1																							
23	23		301								Changyu	Alright, then I'll just eat plain rice for the rest of the month. That'll do, yeah? Don't be mad!	1																					
24	24		301								Director	You!	2																					
25	25		301									Hearing this, the director gets even more angry. Just as he raises his hand, Laoyu pushes open the doors and enters.																						
26	26		301								Laoyu	D-Director... T-there's a message for you.																						
27	27		204							1																								
28	28		301								Changyu	What's with ol' stuttery answering the door?	1																					
29	29		301								Director	Yusheng asked for leave today because it is the deathday of his mother. But at least he finished up his morning exercise. Did you finish it?	2																					
30	30		204							1	5																							
31	31		301								Changyu	Hmph, I never fall behind on morning exercise! I ran fifty laps around the stage before I left!	1																					
32	32		301								Director	Enough. Head on back. I still want a word with you.	2																					
33	33		204							1																								
34	34		301								Changyu	Alright...	1

36	36		301									The boy pouts. He takes off his backpack and walks back to the yard.																						
37	37		301									But just after walking pass the door, Changyu stops. He climbs up the roof and sneaks into the rafters of the room.

40	40		301			DialogEnable						He gently opens his waist pack and pulls out a bag of braised meat.																						
41	41		301								Changyu	Hehe. If I'm living off plain rice for the rest of the month, I might as well feast on some meat now to tide me over.																						
42	42		301								Changyu	Whodda thought you could "snag" a pack of braised pork from Zhennies off of some hoodlum?																						
43	43		301								Changyu	...Wait. Better save some for Laoyu. He likes it with a good drink.																						
44	44		301									Just as Changyu is about to munch on a slab of meat, the sound of the director's voice grabs his attention.																						
45	45		301								Director	Oh! Hello there, Boss. Long time no see. Right—right—last time we went to your house to perform, but you got a cold and had to rest in the inner hall.																						
46	46		301								Director	Yes, yes. Of course. Everything's still all ready for you.																						
47	47		301								Director	It's all there. Isn't your daughter's sixteenth birthday next week? I already have the calligrapher planned for the congratulatory message as well.																						
48	48		301								Director	...What?																						
49	49		301								Director	Um, oh... It's okay, Boss. No—really, it's not an issue. Don't feel guilty about it. We'll manage...																						
50	50		301									Changyu finds himself shocked. The theater depended on this order to live through the month. If this order is cancelled... that will surely be the final straw.																						
51	51		301								Director	Ah, I see... The younger ones wanted a VR trip to Mars to celebrate...																						
52	52		301								Director	It's okay, Boss. Don't worry about it. For a theater troupe like us, not performing for a day won't starve us out of house and home...																						
53	53		301									The old director's crooked back as he replies sends a pang of remorse through Changyu's heart.																						
54	54		301									With a long sigh, the director finally puts down the receiver and slumps back into his chair.																						
55	55		301								Director	Heard enough?																						
56	56		301								Changyu	!																						
57	57		301								Director	Then get down here.																						
58	58		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Knowing that resistance is futile, Changyu jumps down resentfully.

64	65		301							1	Director	It doesn't matter whether you intended to or not. Also, quit talking with your mouth full of pork.	2																					
65	66		301								Changyu	Director, how about I go pass out flyers tomorrow?	1																					
66	67		301								Director	...This isn't something that passing out flyers can fix.	2																					
67	68		301								Director	Sigh... Forget it... You're all grown up. It's time for you to learn a thing or two about the theater.	2																					
68	69		204							1	14																							
69	70		301								Changyu	Director...	1																					
70	71		301								Director	Changyu, come here. Laoyu, Call over Mr. Bai and Ol' Song in the back courtyard. Dismiss the helpers in the firewood room.	2																					
71	72		301								Laoyu	O-of course.																						
72	73		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Director	I have some things I have to tell you.	3

82	83		301								Director	Don't be so naive!	2																					
83	84		301									The director pounds his cane. After a moment of silence is restored in the room, the old man sighs and opens his mouth.																						
84	85		204							1																								
85	86		204							2	14																							
86	87		301								Director	I know what you've been doing to help, but it's pointless.	2																					
87	88		301								Director	Even our regulars can't convince their children at home to come. Do you think putting up posters will convince hoodlums to come and pay to see our plays?	2																					
88	89		204							1	14																							
89	90		301								Changyu	But...	1																					
90	91		301								Laoyu	Y-you're right, Director. W-we haven't had a play in t-two months.																						
91	92		301								Changyu	Where there's a will, there's a way! You taught me that!	1																					
92	93		301								Changyu	We've been performing for years. We can't just call it quits like that!	1																					
93	94		301								Director	If we quit now, we can do it with our heads held high. Selling the theater should be enough for a fresh start for each and every one of us.	2																					
94	95		301								Director	If we wait this out, then... There won't be any money to line our pockets.	2																					
95	96		301									Changyu's face turns sour. People used to fear the stubborn and arrogant director. But with the steady decline of the troupe, his hardiness malformed into something pathetic. That is what unsettles Changyu the most.																						
96	97		301								Director	I've also considered who will take over the theater—a member of the Chiwen Crew. They've offered a fair price.	2																					
97	98		301								Director	...If this truly is the end, I'll at least be able to say that we're even.	2																					
98	99		202							1	2				1																			
99	100		301									The director rubs the wooden handle of the chair begrudgingly. In his mind, the theater is a living thing.																						
100	101		301									But alas, some things must be put out of their misery, and he had to be the one to end it.																						
101	102		301									The director stands there in silence. The fatigue seems to have taken on an almost age-long pallor. No one knows how to console him.																						
102	103		301									And so everyone stands there as well, in solemn silence.																						
103	104		201							1	500230	14	-400

106	107		301								Changyu	...	1																					
107	108		301								Laoyu	D-D-Director...																						
108	109		301								Changyu	If there's another way... A better way...	1																					
109	110		301								Director	Let this be the end.	2																					
110	111		301								Director	These ol' bones aren't what they used to be. Maybe it's not necessarily a bad thing that I end it here.	2																					
111	112		202							1	2				1																			
112	113		301									Everyone is overcome with silence seeing the director lean dejectedly on his chair. They want to keep living the life they have had—they just cannot.																						
113	114		301									They all know that his old and feeble body has paid a heavy toll trying to hold up this fizzling dream. They even begin to think that it would be best to relieve him of this responsibility.																						
114	115		301								Laoyu	If... If we can just m-make it through this month...																						
115	116		201							1	500230	5
