23	21		301								Liv	This is not a risk you can afford to take. Not for an organization the size of the Forsaken.	1																					
24	22		301								Liv	If you require my help, you should have asked us about it.	1

34	32		301								Watanabe	But now, we need the coming event to succeed.	2																					
35	33		301								Watanabe	For this, placing your companions in danger to slow down the Corrupted—it was all part of the plan.	2
