29	29		301									Holding on to her damaged frame, Lucia chases after the mid-air Liv with the time Changyu, Sophia, Lee, and Chrome are buying her.																						
30	30		301									Is Lucia's life just a dead end that she cannot leave?																						
31	31		301									Once again, in a similar church, in a similar way, she is about to say a similar goodbye.																						
32	32		301									It happened to the old Gray Raven as well. Commandant Ravenge led them on a mission to make contact with a "Construct" immune to the Punishing Virus.																						
33	33		301									Back then, Lucia did not have the clearance to know who authorized the mission or if their information was accurate.																						
34	34		301									Most members of her team were like that. All they knew was that the leaders were particularly ecstatic about this mission.																						
35	35		301									After all, the seemingly harmless "child" could possibly be the hope they require to control the Punishing Virus.																						
36	36		301									Just like before, no one has lied, but everyone has withheld parts of the truth.																						
37	37		301									Lucia has been secretly searching for the truth after getting back her memories of losing her team, but she has not wavered because of that.																						
38	38		201							1	500416	9																						
39	39		301							1	Lucia	Because I believe that there is hope as long as we are together.	1																					
40	40		301								Lucia	But Liv—!	1																					
41	41		301									Lucia leaps up with the help of her thruster, holding onto the hovering ivory sparrow, but Lucia cannot stop what she is doing.																						
42	42		301								Lucia	Wake up! This is not how it should end!	1																					
43	43		301									Regardless of how Lucia cries, Liv still carries on with her hand motions like a mindless puppet.

53	53		302								Lucia, listen to me!	54																						
54	54		301								Lucia	I'm here!	1																					
55	55		301									You quickly tell her your plan and establish a remote connection with her mid-flight.																						
56	56		301								Lucia	Liv has been rejecting any remote connection requests, and her M.I.N.D. is extremely confused.	1																					
57	57		302								About that...	58																						
58	58		301									You quickly tell her what Asimov told you and how you can solve it.																						
59	59		301								Lucia	You mean it isn't just infection but memory data plunging into her M.I.N.D.?	1																					
60	60		301								Lucia	I just have to force my way into her M.I.N.D. and help you establish the connection, is that it?	1																					
61	61		302								Yes.	62																						
62	62		301								Lucia	But how do I force my way in?	1																					
63	63		302								I'll help you.

67	67		301							1	Asimov	You belong to the same team, so your connections are interconnected. It won't be too hard for you to hack into Liv's M.I.N.D., and 【kuroname】 will also help stabilize the Mind Beacon.	13																					
68	68		301									Asimov suddenly joins the comms.																						
69	69		301								Lucia	I see.	1																					
70	70		301								Asimov	But Liv's M.I.N.D. is highly infected right now. The Punishing Virus and the data within her are taking shape.	13																					
71	71		301								Asimov	Think of it as something like the Hetero-Sapiens or the Red Tide projections.	13																					
72	72		301								Asimov	So don't get distracted by them.	13																					
73	73		301								Lucia	Understood.	1																					
74	74		301								Asimov	And I suspect that when an intact M.I.N.D. hacks into there, they will respond by changing their forms according to what you know.	13																					
75	75		301								Asimov	Don't get tricked regardless of what you see.	13																					
76	76		301								Lucia	I won't.	1																					
77	77		201							13	500404		400																					
78	78		301							1	Hippocrates	If Liv's consciousness does not wake up, the remote connection will also fail.	13																					
79	79		301								Hippocrates	Wake her up, no matter the cost.	13																					
80	80		301								Lucia	Aren't you—forget it. I know what to do!	1																					
81	81		302								Lucia, this will be very dangerous.	82																						
82	82		302								You'll be entering a highly corrupted M.I.N.D.	83																						
83	83		204							1	2																							
84	84		301									You tell Lucia all this worriedly and apologetically, but she just smiles and nods.																						
85	85		301								Lucia	Don't worry, Commandant. I won't back down, no matter how dangerous it is!	1																					
86	86		301								Lucia	Are you coming here? I hear the sound of a transport craft in the background.	1																					
87	87		302								Yes, I'm on my way.	88																						
88	88		302								I'll be there soon.	89																						
89	89		301								Lucia	How is your body holding up?	1																					
90	90		302								It'll be fine.	91																						
91	91		301								Lucia	Can I trust you?	1																					
92	92		302								Of course!	93																						
93	93		301									You fist-pump each other through the camera just like you once did.																						
94	94		302								Lucia, come back safely with Liv and everyone.	95																						
95	95		302								This is my request.	96	This is an order.	98																				
96	96		301								Lucia	Roger! I will treat this as an order that I can't fail!	1																					
97	97	100	301								Lucia	You never said the word "order," but I suspect that it might be easier to wake her up if it is one, given how rare she thinks for herself.	1																					
98	98		301								Lucia	Roger! I'll complete the mission!	1																					
99	99		301								Lucia	That is also my wish!	1
