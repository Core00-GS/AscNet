3	3		301									The incapacitated service robots fall flat on the floor, but even while trembling, they kept the drinks in the glasses unspilled.																						
4	6		301								Service Bot	Please... taste-test... new...																						
5	7		301									They still have yet to give up, but their broken joints deny them from standing up.

7	9		301							1	Karenina	*****! CUT IT ALREADY!	1																					
8	10		301									With her brows crumpled into a maze, Karenina returns and sits back on the supply crates.																						
9	11		202							1																								
10	12		301								Service Bot	Why... Please... survey... Improvements...																						
11	13		301									Wringing out the last bit of its strength, a service bot faintly nudges you with a glass of cocktail.																						
12	14		301								Service Bot	Please... taste-test... new...																						
13	15		302								Sure.	16																						
14	16		201							1	500180																							
15	17		301							1	Karenina	Hey! You gone mad or something?!	1																					
16	18		302								I'll handle this.	19																						
17	19		301								Karenina	...Oh, WHATEVER!	1																					
18	211		202							1																								
19	20		301									Karenina swivels, her back now facing you, and begins messing with the fireworks again, all silent.																						
20	255		302								(Drink)	21	(Take a teensy-weensy sip)	21																				
21	21		301									The recipe is noticeably improved by Karenina, but the eldritch traces of the old recipe still lingers. The moment the liquid touches the tip of your tongue, you feel an acrid explosion in your mouth.																						
22	22		302								(Force a smile)	24	(Frown)	24																				
23	24		301								Service Bot	Please... comments...																						
24	25		302								It's good.	26																						
25	26		301								Service Bot	Thank you... Thank you...																						
26	27		301								Service Bot	The new recipe is... finally... approved of... Re-opening...																						
27	28		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The noise-riddled voice of the service bot echoes over and over on the beach, but its companions are cold and silent, already broken.

29	30		301									‚ÄîA brilliant stream of light streaks up into the night sky. The firework explodes in a blinding pattern of lights.																						
30	31		302								Huh?	32																						
31	32		201							1	500180	6																						
32	33		301							1	Karenina	What? These scrapjacks are re-opening, yeah?	1																					
33	34		302								Yeah. Openings come with fireworks.	35	You read about it in the Babylonia database?	35																				
34	35		301								Karenina	Mh-hm. It's on the files for fireworks.	1																					
35	37		301								Service Bot	Opening... Customers...																						
36	38		301									The fallen down robot tries its best to lift its arm, extending them into a welcoming pose.																						
37	233		204							1																								
38	39		301									And like that, under the light of the fireworks, the robot ceased to function, forever.																						
39	40		302								Goodnight.	41	Sleep well.	41																				
40	41		301									Karenina has walked over to your side without you knowing. The two of you gaze at the night sky, illuminated by the fireworks.																						
41	42		301								Karenina	Opening, huh. Sounds... nice.	1																					
42	43		302								Yeah.	44																						
43	44		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					The sea breeze caresses the night beach, bringing light gusts of sand over. They slowly bury the service bots, as if in goodbye to these industrious workers of the past.
