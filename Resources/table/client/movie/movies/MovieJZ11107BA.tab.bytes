3	3		301			DialogEnable					Jamilah's Letter	Perhaps the anti-royalists thought they could smear the name of Akdilek behind my back and force me into submission.																						
4	4		301								Jamilah's Letter	But they failed to acknowledge my strength and that I have no intention to become their puppet of a princess.																						
5	5		301								Jamilah's Letter	That night, when Sophia was brought in front of me. I held my head high and told her the truth.																						
6	6		301								Jamilah's Letter	She made her choice herself, though it took her some time to do so... To be honest, I was a bit worried she would refuse.																						
7	7		301								Jamilah's Letter	Since asking me to take care of Sophia was Andre's last words. He saw her as a daughter of his own.																						
8	8		301								Jamilah's Letter	Sigh, how dare he ask me, one still hasn't been engaged, to do something like this. I only have experience in raising subordinates, so I guess that will have to do.																						
9	9		301								Jamilah's Letter	I originally wanted her to become a pawn for me to control, a sword to protect me, but as I watched her grow, I started having other thoughts.																						
10	10		301								Jamilah's Letter	And perhaps I already had thoughts of helping her "leave the nest" long ago.																						
11	11		301								Jamilah's Letter	Perhaps what happened with "Ashlar" helped push me in the right direction.																						
12	12		301								Jamilah's Letter	Even though they are skilled in inciting people, I can't comprehend why they think they can hide things from me when their servants are all spies for me.																						
13	13		301								Jamilah's Letter	Well, that's that. Sophia volunteered to become my guard afterward and the rest is history.																						
14	14		301								Jamilah's Letter	I only want to say that, sending Sophia up to Babylonia is not for a "trade" nor is she a "hostage". I genuinely hope for this little girl, who has been on this train for her whole life, to be able to experience the world outside.																						
15	15		301								Jamilah's Letter	I may not be able to apologize to her directly, but I am still responsible for all the blood on her hands. And it's all thanks to these "necessary sacrifices" that Akdilek has been enjoying peace since I took over																						
16	16		301								Jamilah's Letter	I'm really conflicted about her future. On one hand, I want her to become even stronger, but on the other, I want her to enjoy life like a girl her age should. Never mind... It's not something I can decide at the moment.																						
17	17		301								Jamilah's Letter	Forgive me for being selfish and entrusting "her" to you. Please train her with care and kindness.
