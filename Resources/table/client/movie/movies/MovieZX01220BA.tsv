23	23		301							1	Sophia	Yes, I am Sophia, and I will be your terminal attendant today. If you need anything, just let me know. A 50% surcharge will be applied to all goods and services.	1																					
24	24		301								Watanabe	You sure know how to rip tourists off... Anyway, didn't know this train was staffed with terminal attendants. I thought your carriages were all installed with speakers to broadcast announcements.	2																					
25	25		301								Sophia	We do, but Princess Jamilah said the Forsaken carriage should go low-power, so we turned it off.	1

28	28		301							1	Forsaken Soldier	Mr. Watanabe, we're almost at our destination. What's the next move?	1																					
29	29		301								Watanabe	Since we're a bit short on numbers, skirmishing would be the best course of action. After all, the intel report from Babylonia mentioned that the Corrupted are moving along a set route.	2																					
30	30		301								Forsaken Soldier	...Understood, I'll spread the word.	1																					
31	31		301								Watanabe	What's the plan on your end? You and that boy are the only combatants you've got, right?	2

33	33		301							1	Sophia	The two of us will be enough.	1																					
34	34		301								Watanabe	That's some confidence right there. Anyway, as soon as the door opens, we Forsakens will jump off and intercept the enemy. Can you keep an eye on our luggage while we're gone?	2																					
35	35		301								Sophia	Okay, but we won't take responsibility for anything lost.	1																					
36	36		301								Watanabe	Hah, shrewd... All personnel, get ready to jump off at the next turn. Our target is the marching Corrupted.	2
