11	11		301								???	Did I scare you? My name's Selena. I'm the author.	2																					
12	12		301								Selena	Pardon me, but I was really glad to hear your feedback.	2																					
13	13		301								Ayla	Huh? You made this theater play?	1																					
14	14		301								Selena	It's a bit embarrassing... And still not good enough.	2																					
15	15		301								Selena	But this is indeed my work. I created it, so I must take own up to it!	2																					
16	16		301								Ayla	But you don't look much older than me... Very impressive.	1																					
17	17		301								Selena	How kind of you. No need to keep flattering me.	2																					
18	18		301								Selena	Come on, let's talk about the play!	2																					
19	19		301								Selena	It's an adaptation of the early human theater play "The Tempest" in the database. Due to the lack of data, I could only restore part of it...	2

28	28		301							1	Selena	That's great! I was so worried about my theater scenery. I don't know how to create the setup I want.	1

38	38		301								Selena	That means we have a great vibe. We've talked about so much stuff! I learned a lot today.	2																					
39	39		301								Ayla	I've got to go. In the end, your theater play was the only thing I experienced today, haha.	1																					
40	40		301								Selena	Sorry... I was just too happy.	2																					
41	41		301								Selena	But you too, you were so focused and forget the time, Ayla!	2

46	46		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Many days passed. And Ayla lost count.																						
47	47		301									But she enjoyed every single day because she found her soul mate of similar age.																						
48	48		301									Ayla wanted to share everything with Selena immediately: knowledge of art, creativity, or simply anything they both were interested in.																						
49	49		301									But she has her own melancholy too.

58	58		301							1	Ayla	Aha, I knew it. Selena always draws a little bear in the beginning.	1																					
59	59		301								Meka	Ayla, I looked up your new friend and she's really good.	2																					
60	60		301								Ayla	Of course Selena is good!	1																					
61	61		301								Ayla	...What did you find though, ma'am?	1																					
62	62		301								Meka	I saw her name earlier in the city exhibition hall. Out of curiosity, I asked a friend about her.	2																					
63	63		301								Meka	My friend was the manager of the art show. She told me Selena was their most promising prospect.	2																					
64	64		301								Ayla	What? What does she mean by... prospect?	1																					
65	65		301								Meka	Hmm... Renowned, maybe.	2																					
66	66		301								Meka	She has great potentials, and her skills are developing fast.	2																					
67	67		301								Meka	I saw her works... It's hard to imagine they were created by a teenager.	2																					
68	68		301								Ayla	...Yeah. But she's Selena so I'm not surprised at all...	1																					
69	69		301								Meka	I see. You probably haven't realized, because you two are good friends.	2																					
70	70		301								Meka	But to us, she'll probably shine like a star in the future.	2																					
71	71		301								Ayla	...Of course. Selena will become famous, without a doubt...	1																					
72	72		301								Meka	Hopefully. If that's the case, I'll be witnessing the growth of a great artist.	2																					
73	73		301								Meka	Oh, sorry, Ayla. I hope I haven't wasted too much of your time.	2																					
74	74		301								Meka	I'll get going. Not all the students are like you, Ayla. They need to be disciplined...	2

78	78		301								Mail Content	Remember what I told you before? My theater play will be displayed in the exhibition!																						
79	79		301								Mail Content	I thought I just needed to give them the scripts. Turned out there was more work to do. Supervising, checking... Such a hassle.																						
80	80		301								Mail Content	Oh, right. By saying "them", I mean the World Government Association of Art of Babylonia. They're professionals!																						
81	81		301								Mail Content	By the way, I met many Constructs as well!																						
82	82		301								Mail Content	They were no different from humans! I couldn't imagine their bodies were made of machines.

86	86		301								Mail Content	I saw the works of many adults. Yours are as good as theirs, if not better.
