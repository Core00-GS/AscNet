5	5		301			DialogEnable						Somewhere in the desert, battlefield cleanup is underway in a Forsaken base. Sand and dust cover every inch of ground.																						
6	6		201							1	1101001																							
7	7		301							1	Watanabe	The third time this month...	1

9	9		301									A dark, long needle-like object protrudes from the ground in the center of the base.																						
10	10		301									Defeated mechanoids scatter on the ground nearby. They seem to have been corrupted. Fully-armed soldiers are preparing to ship them to the disposal site.																						
11	11		201							1	500005																							
12	12		301							1	Forsaken Soldier	Luckily we received a warning beforehand and evacuated this base before the conversion probe landed.	1																					
13	13		201							1	1101001																							
14	14		301							1	Watanabe	The frequency of attacks from Punishing-corrupted Territory has been increasing recently. We can't always predict them like this one.	1																					
15	15		201							1	500005																							
16	16		301							1	Forsaken Soldier	...And all other ground forces across the world are losing their bases too.	1																					
17	17		301								Forsaken Soldier	All because of this "Conversion Probe" launched from areas corrupted by the Punishing Virus.	1																					
18	18		301								Forsaken Soldier	It immediately releases a high-concentration Punishing Virus to control all nearby mechanoids once it lands...	1																					
19	19		201							1	1101001																							
20	20		301							1	Watanabe	Probes launched from the ground are less of a threat as they usually come from far away. We have depth, so we can still intercept them.	1																					
21	21		301								Watanabe	But...	1

23	23		301									Watanabe looks up to the sky.																						
24	24		201							1	1101001																							
25	25		301							1	Watanabe	But those launched from the low Earth orbit are shielded by the orbital debris. They have high velocity and are almost launched vertically above us...	1																					
26	26		201							1	500005																							
27	27		301							1	Forsaken Soldier	Mr. Watanabe, do you mean the... corrupted International Space Station...?	1																					
28	28		201							1	1101001																							
29	29		301							1	Watanabe	Yeah.	1																					
30	30		201							1	500005																							
31	31		301							1	Forsaken Soldier	It's probably been giving Babylonia a hard time too.	1																					
32	32		201							1	1101001																							
33	33		301							1	Watanabe	Yeah. From our optical observation alone, they have been firing at each other more than ever...	1																					
34	34		301								Watanabe	Not just that, Babylonia also pulled back most of their elite ground forces.	1																					
35	35		301								Watanabe	Including that Gray Raven squad... They have all been summoned back to reinforce their space forces.	1																					
36	36		201							1	500005																							
37	37		301							1	Forsaken Soldier	Mr. Watanabe, are you implying...	1																					
38	38		201							1	1101001																							
39	39		301							1	Watanabe	Right. Our intel shows that Babylonia has decided to eliminate the corrupted space station once and for all.	1																					
40	40		201							1	500005																							
41	41		301							1	Forsaken Soldier	Wow... Can they really do it? Going against that thing...	1																					
42	42		201							1	1101001																							
43	43		301							1	Watanabe	I know what you're thinking. For a long time, they could only wear down the space station by attrition.	1																					
44	44		201							1	500005																							
45	45		301							1	Forsaken Soldier	Probably because there aren't many experienced "Fenrir" pilots left in Babylonia.	1																					
46	46		301								Forsaken Soldier	Ever since the Great Retreat, most good pilots in Babylonia have come to Mr. Watanabe.	1																					
47	47		201							1	1101001																							
48	48		301							1	Watanabe	…………	1																					
49	49		301								Watanabe	From a strategic point of view, Babylonia would never start the war if they didn't have a decisive winning factor.	1																					
50	50		301								Watanabe	They must be hiding some secret we don't know.	1																					
51	51		201							1	500005																							
52	52		301							1	Forsaken Soldier	Are you saying...	1																					
53	53		201							1	1101001																							
54	54		301							1	Watanabe	From our past simulations... Once the threat and communication interference from the space station are reduced...	1																					
55	55		301								Watanabe	The world will start to change.	1																					
56	56		301								Watanabe	So this war will likely determine the future direction of the world.	1																					
57	57		201							1	500005																							
58	58		301							1	Forsaken Soldier	If that's the case...	1																					
59	59		201							1	1101001																							
60	60		301							1	Watanabe	Right. The Forsakens must be part of this.	1																					
61	61		301								Watanabe	We have long prepared for it—	1																					
62	62		301								Watanabe	Forsakens, assemble!	1

70	70		301							1	Watanabe	Follow the protocol—disable all concealments of the base, and try to establish a communication channel with Babylonia!	1																					
71	71		301								Watanabe	Activate all defense systems in the base and open two-thirds of our hangers. You have three hours to complete pre-flight checks...	1																					
72	72		301								Watanabe	...Transfer surface authority to the standby operation officers in the ground mission control center.	1																					
73	73		201							1	500005																							
74	74		301							1	Forsaken Soldier	Sir, are you going to...	1																					
75	75		201							1	1101001																							
76	76		301							1	Watanabe	I'm still the leader of the Forsaken on paper. Now's not the time to be capricious.	1																					
77	77		301								Watanabe	This arrangement doesn't mean we're compromising or cooperating. I'll get us the leverages we deserve.	1
