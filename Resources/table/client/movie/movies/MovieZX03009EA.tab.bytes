12	13		301							1		Through the breach Lee created, Lucia launches at one of the Omega Weapon deployment points. The Hetero-Creatures that were burned by Lee's flames are instantly frozen by her chilling cold.																						
13	15		302								Set up the Omega Weapon now, Liv!	16																						
14	16		201							1	1031001	5																						
15	17		301							1	Liv	I got this. The coordinates are already recorded.	1																					
16	18		202							1					1																			
17	19		301									Holding an Omega Weapon, Liv runs toward the defense position and swiftly installs it to the encirclement that was damaged by Hetero-Creatures, restoring the coastline defense.																						
18	20		302								But how long can the Omega Weapons last...?	21																						
19	21		301									After the battle, the Omega Weapons are almost used up. The defense will not last long if the weapons are not replenished...																						
20	22		201							1	1031001																							
21	23		301							1	Liv	You don't need to worry anymore, Commandant. Because...	1

23	25		301									You see an Engineering Force transport truck rapidly approaching. A girl is driving it.																						
24	26		302								Karenina from the Engineering Force?	27

29	31		301							1		The truck comes to an abrupt stop. Karenina impatiently jumps off it, along with another girl you have never met before coming down the rear seat.																						
30	32		301								Teddy	Nice to meet you, Gray Raven Commandant...	2																					
31	33		301								Karenina	This is Teddy. She can handle all system-related problems of Omega Weapon.	1																					
32	34		301								Teddy	While Karenina will take over whenever you need violence...	2																					
33	35		302								That sounds... very reliable.	36																						
34	36		204							2	13																							
35	37		301									Teddy gazes around with an evil grin.																						
36	38		301								Teddy	I heard you were speaking for Karenina in the Parliament... She was quite thankful for that and kept talking about how to repay that favor.	2																					
37	39		204							1	6																							
38	40		301								Karenina	What?! I never said that... But I don't like owing someone a favor indeed. At least I can repay it this time. Just let us know if you need anything.	1																					
39	41		204							2																								
40	42		301								Teddy	Don't just count me in...	2																					
41	44		302								Alright, can you fix these damaged Omega Weapons first?	46

48	51		301							1	Camu	Hey... The Omega Weapons you deployed on the sea are being attacked by Hetero-Creatures. A lot of them already seem damaged. Do you want to do something about it?	1																					
49	52		301									Camu points the camera of his terminal to the sea. A lot of Hetero-Creatures are already recklessly charging toward the encirclement of Omega Weapons. They will not last long.																						
50	53		302								Where's your light boat, Vera?	54

55	58		201							2	500336	4	-700																					
56	59		301							1	Noctis	It's all rocks here! The boat's stranded at the shore! 	2																					
57	60		201							2	500328	4	-650																					
58	61		301							1	No. 21	I could just crush all these rocks.	2																					
59	62		201							2	500168		-650																					
60	63		301							1	Vera	You hear that, Gray Raven Commandant? We hardly made it here, and the boat's already scrapped after that tough voyage.	2

64	67		301									Hearing your conversation, Karenina suddenly remembers something and smiles.

73	76		301							1	Captain	Hah, did you learn this politeness from the guys in Babylonia?	1																					
74	77		202							1					1																			
75	78		201							1	500088																							
76	79		301							1	Diana	Right... Rosetta, you don't need to be so polite. If this ocean is contaminated by the Red Tide from now on, the Arctic Route Union would probably be devastated, given that it almost completely relies on the ocean to survive.	1																					
77	80		202							1					1																			
78	81		201							1	500382																							
79	82		301							1	Captain	We're just helping ourselves after all. You don't need to hold back. Just use us as much as you need to.	1

81	84		201							1	500140																							
82	85		301							1	Sailor	Exactly. There're no more barriers now... We are all on the same ship, hunting the same big fish!	1																					
83	86		202							1					1																			
84	87		201							1	500382																							
85	88		301							1		The captain gazes into the distance. Not far away, the giant humanoid is still relentlessly heading toward the land.																						
86	89		301								Captain	Hmph... I guess this fish is too big for us. However...	1

89	92		301									The captain swings his hand forward. A large harpoon quickly fires out, piercing a wandering Hetero-Creature.																						
90	93		301								Captain	We can still tackle some little ones!	1

92	95		201							1	500214	1																						
93	96		301							1		Rosetta smiles. She lands on the ship's bow, pointing her spear at the enemies that she is about to confront while whispering to herself.																						
94	97		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Rosetta	Commandant... This time, I will fight for myself, and I'm not alone... Everybody in the ARU will fight for themselves, for the future!	1
