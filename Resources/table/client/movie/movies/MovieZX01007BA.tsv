12	12		301							1	Bianca	I can't be sensible with someone who keeps disturbing me through comms.	1																					
13	13		301								Noctis	I'm bored! We're both working with you, so why are we getting such different treatments?																						
14	14		301								Noctis	But, speaking of which—do you know that the Gray Raven Commandant is a Chief of F.O.S.?																						
15	15		301								Noctis	But now that commandant is leading a team of... trash.																						
16	16		301								Bianca	That's your perspective. Can I hang up now?	1																					
17	17		301								Noctis	Fine, I'll pass you the message from HQ if you're in such a hurry.																						
18	18		301								Noctis	(Pretentiously) Bianca, your frame is capable of increasing its power output through the overclock unit of your Inver-Device after the modification.																						
19	19		301								Noctis	Oh, whoa—gotta figure out how to get a set of those from Kurono.																						
20	20		301								Bianca	Is this trade going to turn into a fight?	1																					
21	21		301								Noctis	You'll have to ask the one who sent the message.

23	23		301								Bianca	I'll wait for the train on the platform, then.	1																					
24	24		301								Noctis	Aren't you using the motorbike I prepared for you? It's really cool...																						
25	25		301								Bianca	This is Bianca. The signal is quite poor here, so I'm terminating the call for now.	1
