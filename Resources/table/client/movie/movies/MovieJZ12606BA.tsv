9	9		301							1	Villier	Since the market's close to Kowloong, there may be Corrupted roaming near where we dock. Take Yazi as your guard, just in case.	1

11	15		301							1		Huaxu's projection flickers as if that is how it expresses the idea of "confusion."																						
12	16		301								Huaxu	Should we cancel the market for now if there is a chance of Corrupted attacking? Otherwise, casualty among the citizens could be catastrophic.	1																					
13	17		301									Villier frowns, pausing the calibration he is working on.																						
14	18		201							1	500150																							
15	19		301							1	Villier	Huaxu, you seem to be caring about those humans more and more during the time you manage the Nighter for me... It's an interesting shift, but you're acting a little too obsessive now.	1																					
16	20		301								Villier	The people of the Nighter are the people of Kowloong. Their freedom and lives have been granted to them, and in return, they must become the cogs that build the machine.	1																					
17	21		301								Villier	The value of the Nighter is to give you... to give Huaxu a body of your own. Only through frequent trades can we expedite the search for the Construct that can serve as your body. A risk like that is too small to stop us.	1																					
18	22		301								Villier	After years of development, the device to transfer your consciousness is almost complete... Soon, there will be no barriers between us... I can touch you, I can hear you...	1

22	26		301									Villier is not expecting a question like this from Huaxu. After a brief silence, he sighs.																						
23	27		201							1	500150																							
24	28		301							1	Villier	...You're indeed thinking more and more like a human.	1																					
25	29		301								Villier	Have I been keeping you around the humans for too long... or have you inhabited Qu's frame for so long that you're starting to think like her?	1																					
26	30		301									Looking at the mechanoid with the same face as him, Villier seems disgusted.																						
27	31		301								Villier	Perhaps I should keep you away from humans after the market...	1

32	36		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						A large figure dashes across the street, and the pedestrians all jump away to avoid it. Recognizing it as one of the Blubber mechanoids that work as security on the Nighter, no one dares stand in its way.																						
33	37		301									Except this is no ordinary Blubber, but Uno, who is holding a small, human girl in its arms.																						
34	38		301									Finally, Uno stops at a quiet corner after leaping and dashing away, gently putting the girl down after making sure there is no danger around.																						
35	39		301									Wounded all over, none of Yoyo's injuries is serious—the words she heard have brought her more pain than any of her physical wounds.

40	44		301									But she can no longer take the path she has walked countless times, and the person who waited for her will no longer be there. Once again, she can only run away alone like when she was younger, powerless to do anything.																						
41	45		201							1	500444																							
42	46		301							1	Uno	Rargh...	1																					
43	47		301									Uno has no idea how to comfort her, so it takes something out of the storage inside its chest and hands it to Yoyo.																						
44	48		301									It is a panda plushie. Having spent countless days and nights with Yoyo through laughter and tears, it now has a big hole in its body, looking more worn than a few years ago. Hanying claimed she could get it fixed.																						
45	49		301								Uno	Rargh!	1																					
46	50		202							1					1																			
47	51		301									Uno may not have realized that Yoyo is past the age when she needs her plushie to sleep. In its memories, the plushie always cheers Yoyo up whenever she was sad.																						
48	52		301									Yoyo holds the plushie she called "Master" in her arms. The warped patch on it is clearly done by Hanying, the only thing the talented dancer could not do well.																						
49	53		301									Inspecting closely, Yoyo can see hints of "blood" where the stitches are—Hanying's human-like body also bleeds like a human.																						
50	54		301									—A machine is always going to be a machine. They exist only to fulfill humans' desires.																						
51	55		201							1	500447	14

61	65		301									Holding the plushie's arms to hit herself with consecutive strikes, Yoyo lowers her voice to mimic the panda character from the old cartoon and talks to herself—the way she used to do with Hanying.

81	87		301								Yoyo	No... we made a promise that we would return to Kowloong together. I won't go back by myself.	1																					
82	88		301								Yoyo	Uno, do you know how to become a Construct? Don't lie to me!	1

95	101		301								Jin Man	I didn't "help." I was "paid to provide a service."	2																					
96	102		301								Yoyo	In that case, I want to become a Construct. How much would that cost...	1																					
97	103		301									Staring at Yoyo with a side glance, Jin Man quickly fiddles with his abacus.																						
98	104		301								Jin Man	As a matter of fact, Hanying already prepared the design and the material... but the operation itself is costly. Do you even have money? Get lost if you don't.	2																					
99	105		301									The money Hanying prepared is kept by herself, so the girl has no way to pay the price.																						
100	106		301								Jin Man	Get lost, then. Why are you still here? Hey, boy, kick them out.	2																					
101	107		202							1	2				1

110	116		301									Jin Man's dismissive expression suddenly turns solemn, no longer acting like his usual condescending self.																						
111	117		301								Jin Man	Do you have any idea what you're talking about? Without your memories of Kowloong, you won't remember what your parents look like, or your life there.	2																					
112	118		301								Yoyo	My parents once told me I'm "terrible at determining the value of a thing. So do what feels right. Don't hold back." If my memories can become my strength, then now is the time to use them.	1																					
113	119		301								Yoyo	Plus, I'm not afraid... Hanying and I promised each other we'd return to Kowloong together. My parents will find me even if I'm a Construct. Then, the four of us will create new memories.	1

131	137		301							1	Jin Man	We might have a deal, but Construct operations are not guaranteed success. You might just die on the operation table... and we'd still charge you the full price. Do you understand?	2																					
132	138		301								Yoyo	I understand... I have to try, even if it's just a small chance!	1																					
133	139		301								Jin Man	Very well... Follow us.	2																					
134	140		202							1	2				1

140	146		301								Jin Man	I'm worried about your skills.																						
141	147		301								Staff	Relaxed. You know that I used to be a member of the Fuxi Crew in Kowloong.																						
142	148		301								Jin Man	Whoa. Very Impressive...																						
143	149		301								Staff	But are you sure about removing her memories during the procedure... She'll forget everything before she boarded the Nighter—her parents, her friends, her past... even her name.																						
144	150		301								Jin Man	Certainly. A contract is a contract. That is what I'm owed.																						
145	151		301								Staff	Do people really buy that stuff...?																						
146	152		301								Jin Man	Of course they do. Freaks run amok on this ship, but... instead of selling it to some peeping junkie, I'd rather keep it as a favor to a promising future dancer.																						
147	153		301								Staff	That's why you're the boss. Of course you've planned it all out.																						
148	154		301								Jin Man	Not to mention that it's a good thing for the girl to stop obsessing over her unrealistic past... Start the operation.
