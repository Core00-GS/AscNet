10	51		301									Gunfire relentlessly assaults the location, while Vera slays enemy after enemy with her blades.																						
11	52		301									Though Vera is a Support-type Construct, not made for combat, the battle skills she possesses are second to none.																						
12	53		301									With her combat techniques, Vera slices through her enemies one by one, forcing the Corrupted to give her their full attention. Like a true Goddess of Death, she rips apart countless of these beings that brought her so much pain.																						
13	54		301									Everything she despises begun from the Punishing Virus, and these Corrupted are the perfect scapegoats.

15	56		301								Vera	It's all your fault! All your fault!	1																					
16	57		301									One Corrupted, two Corrupted... After a short killing spree, Vera realizes that this battle site is not at all like what she expected.	1

21	62		301								Vera	There are way too few enemies here. Did they relocate to another city? But surely, at present, there are no other locations that require these forces.	1																					
22	63		301								Vera	Or did they get split up on the way?	1																					
23	64		301								Vera	The Corrupted rarely move in an organized fashion. Instead, they simply gravitate to wherever humans are. It's therefore quite possible for some of them to get separated from their group.	1																					
24	65		301								Vera	But even so, these can't be the only ones remaining.	1																					
25	66		301									Vera comes to the conclusion that someone has diverted the attention of the Corrupted and led them elsewhere.																						
26	67		301								Vera	...Is this your doing, Average Joe?	1																					
27	68		301									Vera turns on her comms to speak to the rest of her squad. Judging from what she can see, they're the only ones with any mobility left.	1

33	72		301							1	Vera	Ugh, so it really was you? Those were supposed to be my targets!	2																					
34	73		301								Familiar Construct	I'm just lessening your load. It took us a while to decide to stay and defend the place with you, so you'd better appreciate it.	1																					
35	74		301								Vera	I never said you could do that!	2

40	78		301									Judging from the intermittent signals, the others are in trouble. Vera rushes towards the other exit of the city where most of the Corrupted are.
