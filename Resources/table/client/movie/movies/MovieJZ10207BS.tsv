3	3		301								【kuroname】	Are you alone?																						
4	4		201							1	1021001																							
5	5		301							1	Lucia	I'm...	1																					
6	6		301								Lucia	It's just me.	1																					
7	7		301									It's always been just me.																						
8	8		301									Solitude is how everyone came into this world and how most people are. I have often fallen back on this aloof coldness to deter the people who tried to make conversation.																						
9	9		301								【kuroname】	What a coincidence, I'm "just me" too.																						
10	10		301								Lucia	Huh?	1																					
11	11		301									It was an answer I hadn't heard before. Perhaps the person timed it just right, but the first thing that greeted me when I looked up was a smile.																						
12	12		301									An abashed smile, to be sure, but with no lack in warmth.																						
13	13		301									Just the smile to put me at a loss...																						
14	14		301								Lucia	How could someone called "top gun" pretend to understand, to sympathize? Someone like you would never understand what I feel.	1																					
15	15		301								【kuroname】	I do.																						
16	16		301								Lucia	What is that supposed to mean...	1																					
17	17		301								【kuroname】	Want to come with me?																						
18	18		301								【kuroname】	I have a dream, but I cannot make it real on my own.																						
19	19		301								Lucia	Wouldn't any other team do?	1																					
20	20		301								【kuroname】	No one but you will do. No one understands solitude like you. No one yearns to connect like you.																						
21	21		301								【kuroname】	Will you help me, Lucia?																						
22	22		301									The person extended a hand. I knew I should extend mine, but...																						
23	23		301								Lucia	Picking a team like mine won't help you. Babylonia will never clear an under-staffed team for combat operations.	1																					
24	24		301								【kuroname】	Then we'll just have to go find staff. We have to start somewhere.																						
25	25		301								Lucia	Starting somewhere...	1																					
26	26		301								【kuroname】	It doesn't matter if we start from nothing, whether we're top of the class or bottom of the barrel. None of it matters.																						
27	27		301								【kuroname】	Because from this nothingness of new beginnings, the most precious things will come.																						
28	28		301								Lucia	Most precious... Could I... ever find such a thing?	1																					
29	29		301								【kuroname】	You will. I promise.																						
30	30		301								Lucia	What... is it that you want to do?	1																					
31	31		302								Eradicate the Punishing Virus	32	See smiles on everyone's faces	36	I haven't decided yet	42																		
32	32		301								Lucia	Eradicate the Punishing Virus... Do you think it's even possible? Eradicating something we know next to nothing about?	1																					
33	33		301								Lucia	I don't know why, but... something tells me that if I follow you, anything is possible...	1																					
34	34		301									It was a strange feeling, but every word from the person in front of me filled me with confidence.																						
35	35	46	301									And with it, the courage to lay down everything in pursuit of those words.																						
36	36		301								Lucia	Smiles on everyone's faces. You are a weird one... Ah, forgive me. I misspoke.	1																					
37	37		301								Lucia	If it is possible, I too would like to see smiles on everyone's faces.	1																					
38	38		301								Lucia	What a world it would be, to inspire such joy in everyone.	1																					
39	39		301									Listening to 【kuroname】's words, I began to imagine such a world, and my place in it.																						
40	40		301									At least I wouldn't be alone in such a world. Then, if someone were to ask me again, if it was just me...																						
41	41	46	301									In that world, I may be able to say no. "No, everyone's here."																						
42	42		301								Lucia	You... haven't decided what to do next?	1																					
43	43		301									Such powerful words, only to be followed by such indecision.																						
44	44		301									The person to be my commandant merely saw me there, and walked over, and that was that.																						
45	45		301									Such was Commandant's personality.																						
46	46		301									And so I took the hand.																						
47	47		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					And I will never, ever let go.
