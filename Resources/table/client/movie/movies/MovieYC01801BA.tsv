5	5		301									The confines of the transport craft afford little recreation. No snacks. No one shooting the breeze while awaiting landfall. No one laughing or smiling as they disembark to meet the enemy's fire.																						
6	6		301									All that the crew can do is remain in their seats, ensure that equipment and weapons are operational, and review mission details in preparation for immediate engagement upon landing on the surface.																						
7	7		301									The crew needs to be ready at all times for immediate evacuation up making a forced landing—a commonplace in the war against the Corrupted. After all, machines are different from humans. Their attack patterns seem illogical and confounding.

17	17		301									Hassen pauses a moment and looks at the commandants before stopping his gaze on 【kuroname】.																						
18	18		301								Hassen	For many of you, this will be your first time conducting a large-scale operation. There may be pressure, but this is a great honor. All of you have proved your ability on previous independent missions.	1																					
19	19		301								Hassen	Exceptional combat capability is bound to be important, but what is needed in this battle is to command the overall situation without fail.	1																					
20	20		301								Hassen	Therefore, we have specially arranged a commandant as the chief commander of this campaign.	1																					
21	21		301								Hassen	The chief commander has led her team to the surface to clear the way for auxiliary teams.	1																					
22	22		301								Hassen	This battle will demonstrate the effectiveness of coordinated tactics between commandants and Constructs, significantly increasing recognition in this era of retaliation.	1																					
23	23		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Hassen	I hope you will keep this in mind and not fail.	1

35	35		302								Are you worried about me?	36	I'm just thinking about the mission.	38																				
36	36		301								Lee	I'm running a status check on the crew prior to the mission.	1																					
37	37		302								What about them?	44																						
38	38		301								Lee	Looks like rumors of your vigilance are correct.	1																					
39	39		302								Am I under investigation?	40	Rumors?	42																				
40	40		301								Lee	Don't worry, just an old habit.	1																					
41	41		302								...What about them?	44																						
42	42		301								Lee	Don't worry, it's nothing negative.	1																					
43	43		302								...What about them?	44																						
44	44		301								Lee	They're syncing up with their new frames.	1																					
45	45		301								Lee	Initialization should be complete before we make landfall.	1																					
46	46		301								Lee	Actually, "new" isn't exactly apropos.	1																					
47	47		301								Lee	After all, one has been used previously, and the other is a prototype.	1																					
48	48		301								Lee	By this definition, they aren't exactly "new."	1																					
49	49		302								Choosing your words wisely as always, I see.	50	That's alright.	53																				
50	50		301								Lee	Save the jokes.	1																					
51	51		302								I was being serious.	52																						
52	52	54	301								Lee	Really? You reminded me of a certain detestable woman.	1																					
53	53		301								Lee	You sound like that detestable woman from Kurono.	1																					
54	54		301								Lee	Anyway, is that the mission briefing you're holding?	1																					
55	55		302								Why?	56																						
56	56		301								Lee	Hmm... Looks like commandants receive about as much intel as us Constructs.	1																					
57	57		301								Lee	No matter. Seems like they are keeping a tight seal on intel.	1																					
58	58		301								Lee	They don't even want to divulge any more clues regarding the target city to those involved.	1

72	72		301								Lucia	Performing as anticipated. In fact, "Dawn" seems more optimized than "Lotus".	2																					
73	73		301								Lee	Is this new technology from the Science Council...? The prototype's operating at a 40 percent higher power output than the original frame.	1

85	85		302								Can't wait to see you in action.	86
