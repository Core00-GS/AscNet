3	3		301			DialogEnable						Sergey and Antonov take you and the others near the dock, where two huge red ships are berthed in the shallow water.																						
4	4		301									The two ships have been reinforced and connected with boards and other structures. A large number of houses and equipment are arranged both on and around the ships.																						
5	5		301									It seems to be dinnertime. Bright lights are illuminating the ships; shouts and noises can be faintly heard in the distance.

10	10		301							1	Sergey	It has been several years since Vardim, the executive officer of Kyaranta, banished them here. How do you think the nearly 2,000 commune members survived the Arctic winter?	1																					
11	11		301								Antonov	Without the two well-preserved and unused reactors on the Moses class ships, we would have turned into ice sculptures.	2																					
12	12		301								Antonov	Electricity, heat, steam... Everything depends on these two reactors.	2

18	18		301							1	Antonov	It's not that we don't trust you... If we could have stayed in Kyaranta, it wouldn't have come to this.	1																					
19	19		301								Antonov	But when that Vardim guy expelled us on the basis of our "aggression" causing equality issues, the ARU stayed silent on the matter.	1

24	24		301							1	Sergey	It's alright. We don't blame you. The ARU was busy dealing with Derek at the time.	1																					
25	25		301								Antonov	But it is what it is. Even if we cut Vardim to pieces, that would inevitably harm those in Kyaranta.	2																					
26	26		301								Sergey	So do you understand? We can't just hand over the two Moses class ships so easily.	1

40	40		301							1	Rosetta	Indeed, it's all for the sake of survival. We can't ask you to give up your only means of survival just for our sake.	1
