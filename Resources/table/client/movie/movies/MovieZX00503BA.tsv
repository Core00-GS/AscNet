5	5		301								Lee	Rather than deceiving our sensory organs directly, it's more like covering a fictional piece of veil over the real world.	3

8	8		301							1	Lucia	So that sensory discrepancy we felt earlier, that was a form of maladjustment to this type of augmented space?	2																					
9	9		301								Lee	(Nods)	3																					
10	10		301								Lee	However, people have long since known of ways to mess with perception. This kind of thing is not only affective, but also costly.	3																					
11	11		301								Lucia	So, how can we disable this EM projection?	2																					
12	12		301								Lee	Simple. Find the projector, and shut it down.	3																					
13	13		301								Lee	We need to look for places that seem strange.	3																					
14	14		301								Lee	The device will likely be in those places.	3																					
15	15		301								Lee	For instance... here.	3																					
16	16		301									Lee removes the EM projector. The uncanniness of the space around rises by several degrees.																						
17	17		301								Lucia	I see...	2																					
18	18		301								Lee	To ensure the quality and accuracy of the projections, multiple devices have been deployed to amplify their effects from different angles.	3
