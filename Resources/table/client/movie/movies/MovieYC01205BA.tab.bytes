4	5		301			DialogEnable				1	Forsaken Soldier A	Mr. Watanabe, the number of Corrupted coming from the outer rim are decreasing, but...	2

7	6		301							1	Watanabe	They're now pouring out of the city instead, eh.	1																					
8	7		301									After the Forsaken got off the vehicle, they made a temporary encampment on a nearby route to intercept the enemy. Though they are only forty or so in numbers, to these veterans, it is more than enough.																						
9	8		301									Corrupted remains are scattered all over the ground. Watanabe tells his men to salvage the still usable supplies, and he peers at Kowloong Corp in the distance.																						
10	9		301									‚Äî‚ÄîWhat made Kowloong build such a metropolis?																						
11	10		301									The sight is grandiose and consuming, but to Watanabe it borders on a sickly obsession. Home is comfort, but shelter too deep, and it becomes a prison.																						
12	11		301									Watanabe knows that this imposing city will not have many places to house people. Even the shops are likely not in use.																						
13	12		301									The stately streets are fossils, left only to remind themselves of a lost, golden age.

17	14		301							1	Forsaken Soldier B	Mr. Watanabe, I wonder when we'll get to settle down...	3																					
18	15		301									A comrade close by asks a question, and Watanabe glances over.																						
19	16		301									Settling down in the current world is but an extravagant hope. Normally, people know not to dream about it‚Äîdelusions dull your blade.																						
20	105		401							2	10008001																							
21	17		301			RImgBg1Shake						And so Watanabe responds, flipping the knife in his hand, pointing it at the throat of the one who asked the question.																						
22	18		301								Forsaken Soldier A	Mr. Watanabe?!	2																					
23	19		301								Forsaken Soldier B	Um... What are you doing?	3																					
24	20		204							1	5																							
25	21		301								Watanabe	Don't come any closer! Keep your distance!	1

28	104		203							3	0.25	-400																						
29	24		301									They do not understand the situation, but the Forsaken immediately back away as per Watanabe's orders, leaving only Watanabe and the person he just saw through together.																						
30	27		301				PanelActor3Shake				???	And here I thought I was putting on a great act...	3

33	28		301							1		‚Äî‚ÄîHow could this man be so keen? Lamia, who would have preferred to avoid confrontation, sheds her illusion and returns to her original form.																						
34	29		301								Watanabe	You are an Ascendant, aren't you? What are you trying to do by sneaking in here?	1																					
35	30		301								Lamia	I just wanted to pad my results a little... But now... Looks like that's not happening...	2																					
36	31		204							2	1																							
37	32		301								Lamia	If I say sorry, will you... let me go, pops?	2

42	38		204							2	1																							
43	39		301								Lamia	Really? Yay! You can have the Corrupted I brought with me! Do whatever you like to them.	2																					
44	40		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Watanabe	Thanks for the trouble.	1

49	45		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Forsaken Soldier	Mr. Watanabe, should we have let go of that Ascendant?	2																					
50	46		301								Watanabe	We can't win against her now. With her prowess in stealth, if she had intended massacre...	1																					
51	47		301								Forsaken Soldier	...I'm sorry. We held you back, Mr. Watanabe.	2																					
52	48		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Watanabe	Whatever it is, don't let down your guard! The enemy can come from anywhere!	1
