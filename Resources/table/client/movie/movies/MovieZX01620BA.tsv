102	102		301								Liadrin	I was wounded in battle a few days ago. When I was at the rescue camp, I saw a winged mechanical angel. He told me about a power known as the Ascension-Network.

148	148		301							1	Lucia	...Blood.	1

153	153		301								Lucia	...Yes.	1																					
154	154		301								Lucia	I don't understand. Why did Luna become an Ascendant?	1																					
155	155		301								Lucia	I heard that she was disposed of after failing to become a Construct. Did something happen?	1																					
156	156		301								Lucia	Why is she with another me? If she is me... why did she choose to become an Ascendant?	1																					
157	157		302								Maybe she went through something that you didn't.	158																						
158	158		301								Lucia	You mean...	1																					
159	159		302								The same person with different experiences...	160																						
160	160		302								...will make different choices.	161

165	165		301								Lucia	But...	1																					
166	166		301									Lucia looks up and stretches her hand toward the distant sky. The sun hiding behind the clouds struggles to shine a ray of light between her fingers.
