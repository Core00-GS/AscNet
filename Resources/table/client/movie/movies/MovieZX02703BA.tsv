38	38		301									After pressing the last button, the human struggles to stand up and walks toward it.																						
39	39		301									Her bloodstained face is plain to see. She reaches out toward it.																						
40	40		301									It can feel the human's soft yet wet touches on its face. They come from her blood-soaked fingers.																						
41	41		301								Female Researcher	The kid... she named you "Haicma", didn't she?	1																					
42	42		301								Female Researcher	Your neural logic circuit has already—cough—replaced your identification with that name.	1																					
43	43		301								Female Researcher	You approved of it yourself.	1

48	48		301									It realizes that its local operating system has been transferred from the computer blocks to this bionic frame.																						
49	49		301									The white-haired humanoid slowly raises its—her hands and observes her body, comprehending the new and strange experience. Her mind rapidly runs in the new memory shell, capturing every new sensation with her fingertips.																						
50	50		301									The identification code reveals this body to be a prototype, created to be a new line of mechanoid nannies with the appearance of a young woman to look more friendly to young children.

54	54		301								Female Researcher	As per regulation, all information and data regarding the machine consciousness experiment will be removed.	1																					
55	55		301								Female Researcher	"Haicma" won't show up in any machine or human records.	1																					
56	56		301									"Haicma". It is a name—a gift—from a "friend."

66	66		301									Haicma's mind is flooded by the data stream. Without any commands, a name shows up in her priority requests.

75	75		301								Female Researcher	...Find her... Protect her...																						
76	76		301								Haicma	Understood. Registering "Find and protect subject MPL-00" as the prioritized command—																						
77	77		301								Female Researcher	No... Not a command... A request.																						
78	78		301								Female Researcher	Please... Find Nanami... Protect her...																						
79	79		301								Female Researcher	Just like how our children are our legacy... the machines we built... are our pride...

81	81		301								Female Researcher	So...																						
82	82		301									Haicma's sense of self is rapidly reconstructing. The researcher's dry lips keep speaking, but Haicma cannot understand any of it.																						
83	83		301								Haicma	I don't understand your last command... Please elaborate... Please tell me... Please, tell me...																						
84	84		301									The researcher's vital sign is barely noticeable at this point. Her lips tremble as she holds up her hand, grasping Haicma's fingertip with the last ounce of her strength.																						
85	85		301									In the end, she leaves Haicma with a serene smile. Haicma cannot understand how she can be so calm before an excruciatingly painful death.																						
86	86		301								Haicma	...

97	97		301									There is no more human or machine activity outside. The heavy locked door opens easily from the mechanoid's strength, and the scent of blood and smoke rushes in. A man falls across the doorstep as it opens.																						
98	98		301									Haicma recognizes him as the man who often showed up with the female researcher. Beyond this lab, he was also Nanami's father.																						
99	99		301									Nanami would always talk about her perfect family and her loving parents with an innocent smile.																						
100	100		301									His terminal on the floor shows that the last flight to evacuate from here has left. The two researchers should have had boarded that plane.
