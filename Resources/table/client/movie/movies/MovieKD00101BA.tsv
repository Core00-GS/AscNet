14	14		301								Martin	So... Why did you call a bunch of mechanoids here all of a sudden?	2																					
15	15		301								Nanami	No, you're doing it wrong! We should start with introductions. Hi, I'm Nanami, nice to meet you!	1																					
16	16		301								Martin	Well, I'm Martin...	2																					
17	17		301								Nanami	Nooo, you are... you are a knight!	1

26	26		301								Nanami	There seems to be a medieval roleplaying game somewhere in the M.I.N.D. What's it called? I remembered the keyword is... right, it's assassins!	1

38	38		301								Nanami	Don't worry about it!	1																					
39	39		301								Nanami	Anyway, can you see the tower over there?	1																					
40	40		301									She points at a gray tower behind her, its spire hidden in the cloudy sky, its top concealed.

43	43		301								Nanami	You got me! Come on, Nanami's army, let's march to the top of the tower!	1																					
44	44		301								Martin	So, is this some kind of roleplaying game...	2																					
45	45		301								Nanami	It should have a name. How about "50 Levels of Gray Tower"?	1																					
46	46		301								Rohacchi	Do Rohacchi, go too?	3																					
47	47		301								Nanami	All of you are going!	1																					
48	48		301									Nanami puts her hand up, and the mechanoids around her respond by gently swaying along with her movement.																						
49	49		301								Nanami	The path to victory is to strategically capture each level of the Gray Tower and save the trapped princess...	1																					
50	50		301								Martin	Is there a real princess up there?	2																					
51	51		301								Nanami	Maybe! It has to be something special, nonetheless!	1																					
52	52		301								Rohacchi	As long as, I stay with you.	3
