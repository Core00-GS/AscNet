17	17		301									As the four of them approach their destination, each begins to show different signs of infection.																						
18	18		301								Construct B	The Punishing Virus concentration here is getting dangerously high. Are you sure she's here?	2

22	22		301								Angel	I know my sister is here for a fact, just like how she always found me when we played hide-and-seek as kids. Our blood has bonded us.	1

27	27		301									A female Construct walks out of the ruins' shadows and calmly gazes at Angel.																						
28	28		301								Angel	Sister! I found you!	1																					
29	29		301								Liadrin	Actually, I found you. But he's right, you should turn around.	2																					
30	30		301								Angel	Yes, I should go back, and so should you.	1																					
31	31		301								Liadrin	I chose this, Angel. You shouldn't interfere.	2																					
32	32		301								Angel	I just want to be with you, Sister!	1																					
33	33		301								Liadrin	Be with me...	2																					
34	34		301								Liadrin	Angel, when I fought as a Construct, I witnessed terrible deaths over and over again.	2																					
35	35		301								Liadrin	At this rate, you'll lose me sooner or later.	2																					
36	36		301								Liadrin	The only way to save me from the threat of the Punishing Virus is doing what Gabriel the angel told me to do.	2																					
37	37		301								Angel	Really?	1																					
38	38		301								Angel	If there is a shortcut, then why are we still fighting against the virus?!	1																					
39	39		301								Liadrin	...	2																					
40	40		301								Liadrin	Good question. Every "shortcut" comes with a certain risk. However, if the alternative is to die in battle like the others, I'd rather take the risk. I was never born to fight. I was born to do research with you.	2																					
41	41		301								Angel	Sister... Did you come to that conclusion after being wounded?	1																					
42	42		301								Liadrin	...	2																					
43	43		301								Angel	I've always wanted to apologize... You gave up your future so that I could remain a researcher...	1																					
44	44		301								Liadrin	...Only I was compatible with the copolymers. It wasn't your fault.	2																					
45	45		301								Angel	But... But if I also gave up my position, then we could've just survived as humans!	1																					
46	46		301								Liadrin	Don't be silly. You only agreed to do research with me because that was the safest option.	2																					
47	47		301								Liadrin	But ever since I became a Construct, you can't stay focused on your job. It's only a matter of time before you're fired.	2																					
48	48		301								Liadrin	You know very well what it means to lose that job now.	2																					
49	49		301								Liadrin	Regardless, there's no "if." I am what I am already.	2																					
50	50		301								Angel	Did you conceal your injuries from me because you were worried about me?	1																					
51	51		301									There is a sudden movement in the shadows of the ruins, but no one besides Liadrin has sensed it at all.																						
52	52		301								Liadrin	Angel, you have to leave now.	2																					
53	53		301								Angel	Why? I won't leave without you. Come with me!	1																					
54	54		301								Angel	We've been together since we were born. You're my only family left in this world!	1																					
55	55		301								Liadrin	It's too dangerous here. Go, go with them!	2																					
56	56		301								Angel	No! Sister... I always did what you told me to do... but this time...	1																					
57	57		301									Angel's voice is shaking. Tears rush out of her eyes uncontrollably. She tosses her gun and throws herself at Liadrin.																						
58	58		301								Angel	Just let me follow my heart for once... Sister!	1																					
59	59		301									Liadrin tries to push away Angel, who is holding onto her arm, but in a split second—																						
60	60		301			PanelActor1Shake				1	Angel	Eh...?	1																					
61	61		203							1	0.25	-400	-1000																					
62	62		301									Angel's body falls backward while her hand is still tightly clasping Liadrin's arm.																						
63	63		301								Liadrin	Angel!	2																					
64	64		301									The other three Constructs react immediately to this horrifying scene. They hold up their weapons and fire fiercely at Gabriel, but all of them are incapacitated after just a few seconds.																						
65	65		201							1	500101		-400																					
66	66		301							1	Gabriel	Looks like the material is here.	1																					
67	67		301								Liadrin	What did you say?!	2																					
68	68		301								Gabriel	I knew I was right about you. You have the gift. All you need is a little extra help.	1																					
69	69		301								Angel	Sister...																						
70	70		301									Angel focuses away from the excruciating pain. She presses hard against her severed wrist and wipes off the blood splashed into her eyes.																						
71	71		301									But when she opens her eyes again, everything is still covered in red—the Punishing Virus is gushing out from Gabriel's hand. It then transforms into a bright red electric current and wraps itself around Liadrin like a bloody worm.

73	74		301			PanelActor2Shake					Liadrin	Ahhhh!	2																					
74	75		301								Gabriel	Watch this closely.	1																					
75	76		301									Gabriel hurls a broken slate at the immobilized researcher, crushing her ribs loudly before she realizes what is happening.																						
76	77		301									Angel shakily stretches out her intact hand toward Liadrin.																						
77	78		301								Angel	...Sister... I just want to... be with you...																						
78	79		301								Angel	Without you... I...																						
79	80		401							2	1512																							
80	81		301									Her unfinished words disappear into the wind. The stretched out hand heavily drops on the ground.																						
81	82		301								Liadrin	Angel—!	2																					
82	83		301								Gabriel	Very good. You'll do well as one of us.	1																					
83	84		301			PanelActor1Shake					Liadrin	Ahhhhhhhh!	2

86	87		301									Liadrin's wailing echoes painfully over the ruins but does not bring her any comfort. The living creatures around the area regard it merely as shrieking winds.																						
87	88		301				RImgBg1Disable					Still being corroded by the Punishing Virus, she raises her weapon and uses all of her strength to strike the Ascendant whom she thought was an angel—
