10	10		201							1	500445

14	14		301			RImgBg1Shake						Before Pulao can finish her line, Demon Bane has already broken through the window nearby and disappeared on the street.

19	19		301			RImgBg1Shake						The other minions quickly go through the same hole that he left, leaving a completely wrecked window behind.																						
20	20		201							1	500445	5																						
21	21		301							1	Pulao	No! We saved a long time to fix that window!	1

24	24		301								Pulao	They're gone...	1																					
25	25		301								Pulao	Whatever. I'll go check it out, Master. Hope we can still fix it.	1

28	28		301							1	Master	Leave it to me.	2																					
29	29		202							1	2				1																			
30	30		301									Master walks past Pulao and heads to the window, but Pulao senses something unusual from his words.																						
31	31		201							1	500455																							
32	32		301							1	Master	What's wrong? You seem to have something to say.	1																					
33	33		201							1	500445	8																						
34	34		301							1	Pulao	Um, Master, your voice doesn't sound right. Are you sick?	1																					
35	35		201							1	500455																							
36	36		401							1	202																							
37	37		301							1	Master	No, I'm fine. I'm very healthy. I can walk up five floors without panting... Cough... cough...	1

39	39		201							2	500445	14	-350																					
40	40		301							1	Pulao	Master!	2																					
41	41		301								Pulao	How is that "fine"?	2																					
42	42		202							1	2				1																			
43	43		301									Pulao rushes to Master as he kneels on the ground. He is unable to control his limbs. His eyes are turning red.																						
44	44		201							1	500455		350																					
45	45		201							2	500445	14	-350																					
46	46		301							1	Master	I'm fine.	1																					
47	47		301									Master wipes Pulao's anxious tears with a trembling hand. He smiles at her.																						
48	48		301								Master	Well, I thought it was just a cold. This "Punini" virus hits harder than I think.	1																					
49	49		301								Pulao	Have you been like this for a while...? Why didn't you tell me...?	2																					
50	50		301								Master	Because I don't want to see you like this.	1																					
51	51		301								Pulao	Um... You always treat me like a kid, Master.	2																					
52	52		301								Pulao	I'm no longer that kid who always made people worry.	2																					
53	53		301								Pulao	What to do... Argh... Should I get you some medicine?!	2																					
54	54		301								Master	No need. Besides, I don't think medicine can cure this disease.	1																					
55	55		301								Pulao	Medicine... Right, ordinary medicine probably won't work.	2																					
56	56		301								Master	Are you thinking of that legend?	1																					
57	57		301								Pulao	Yes! I heard there was an old celestial in the mountains. He has an elixir that could cure any disease!	2																					
58	58		301								Pulao	If I can get that elixir, we can cure whatever Puni-thing you have.	2																					
59	59		301								Master	No need. A lot of things happened today, I'm probably just tired. I just need some rest, and everything will be fine.	1																					
60	60		202							1	2				1																			
61	61		301									Pulao helps Master get on his feet. She gazes at him and mumbles.																						
62	62		201							1	500455		350																					
63	63		201							2	500445	5	-350																					
64	64		301							1	Pulao	No.	2																					
65	65		301								Master	What?	1																					
66	66		301								Pulao	You have always been taking care of me, Master. Now it's my turn to take care of you!	2																					
67	67		301									Pulao raises her head and looks Master firmly in the eye.																						
68	68		301								Master	Do you have to go?	1																					
69	69		301								Pulao	I must.	2																					
70	70		301								Master	Hmm... Alright. My brother would laugh at me if I still can't make up my mind.	1																					
71	71		301								Master	One moment please.	1																					
72	72		202							1	2				1																			
73	73		301			RImgBg1Shake						Master knocks on the wall nearby. Heavy clangs of gears turning can be heard inside. Before long, the wooden wall suddenly cracks open and a wooden crate pops out from within, falling into Pulao's hands.																						
74	74		201							1	500445																							
75	75		301							1	Pulao	It's-a-sword?	1																					
76	76		301									Pulao looks at the crate and sees three words written in exaggerated calligraphy style‚Äî"It's a sword".																						
77	77		201							1	500455																							
78	78		301							1	Master	You don't know what will happen along the way. I hope it can protect you on my behalf.	1																					
79	79		202							1					1																			
80	80		301									When the crate is opened, it dissipates an antique aroma.																						
81	81		301									Sunlight shines upon the sword through the window, leaving a golden reflection in the inscription on it.																						
82	82		301									Master nods at Pulao and she nods in return. She grabs the red ribbon on the sword's hilt. It gives a warm feeling.																						
83	83		201							1	500445	5																						
84	84		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Pulao	Wait for me, Master.	1
