3	3		301									I noticed my memory fragmentations long ago.																						
4	4		301									I have no recollection of the last days of the old Gray Raven. In my memories, we were together one day, and in the next, I was suddenly and inexplicably alone.																						
5	5		301									I could not find info about my previous commandant, nor could I access the files on my former comrades. It was as if it was only me all along.																						
6	6		301									Shards of my lost memories contest this statement.																						
7	7		301									I vague remember the members of the old Gray Raven, and the old commandant's tactical preferences.																						
8	8		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Tandem attacks were a Gray Raven specialty.

15	15		301								Corrupted	Urgh!	1																					
16	16		301									That was our Corrupted rabbit, Hiro.																						
17	17		301									Equipped for short-duration flight, Hiro would use his speed to bait the enemy into traps and ambushes.																						
18	18		202							1																								
19	19		301								???	The rest have been drawn off. We've just got this Riot left, right?																						
20	20		201							1	1021001																							
21	21		301							1	Lucia	Affirmative. Take down the Riot model before Hiro comes back, then sweep and clear all Corrupted elements.	1																					
22	22		301								???	Five-by-five! Let's go, Murol!																						
23	23		301								???	Go right, I'll go left!																						
24	24		202							1																								
25	25		301									The one on the left was Murol, Xun on the right. They were hybrid-type Constructs, able to adapt to changes on the battlefield and switch between attacker and support roles.

29	29		301			RImgBg1Shake						By the time the Riot noticed the subtle change in its quarry, it was already too late. The fight was already over when it was separated.																						
30	30		301									An EM cable was shot from Murol's side and whipped around the lumbering Riot while Xun, giving himself a boost with the recoil from his cannon, grabbed hold of the cable, closing the EM lock.																						
31	31		301									The duo formed a makeshift tripwire within seconds, and as expected, the lumbering Corrupted form was unable to move out of the way and crashed into the cable.

36	34		301			PanelActor1Shake						Electric currents ran through the Riot's frame in an instant. Even without pain receptors, its internal modules were shut down from the massive short.																						
37	35		301								Commandant	Lucia, strike the final blow.																						
38	36		301									A long-range message from Commandant.																						
39	37		301									Commandant's body was flesh and blood, after all. In a combat scenario of this scale, standard procedure was to find a suitable vantage point to coordinate from afar.

51	47		301			RImgBg1Shake					Murol	Hold up, how is this thing still moving!?																						
52	48		301								Xun	Must be the Punishing Virus. Records indicate that the virus has rewritten and repaired its hosts before.

55	51		301							1	Lucia	Which also means that our attacks are working.	1																					
56	52		301									My grip on my blade tightened. I sent instructions to Murol and Xun, telling them to keep the EM noose wound tight.
