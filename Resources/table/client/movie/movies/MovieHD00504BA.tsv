6	6		302								Is something wrong?	7	S-Sophia...?	7																				
7	7		301								Sophia	Part of the train's self-diagnostic system failed so the axle temperature detecting system didn't work when the axle boxes overheated which means the alarm didn't sound and the emergency repair didn't happen...	1

15	15		302								Lee, what's going on?	16	The look on your face tells me you've run into trouble?	16																				
16	16		301								Lee	Something went wrong with the self-diagnostic system. If we don't take care of it now, the train won't last to the next checkpoint. We have to be prepared for an emergency repair in the tunnel.	1																					
17	17		301								Lee	The tunnel is way too narrow for the operation, and there are so many industrial-grade mechanoids inside. If they got infected, we'll be at a serious disadvantage in terms of the environment and our numbers.	1																					
18	18		302								Alright, let me notify the others.	19	Relax! I can help.	19																				
19	19		301								Lee	Don't underestimate how dangerous it is to fight in the tunnel. I'll try to keep us in an advantageous environment when we stop the train, but, Commandant, you mustn't let your guard down...	1																					
20	20		302								Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.	21	Are you worried about me?	23

24	24		301								Lee	Of course not. I'm just concerned with the effectiveness of our operation here, and it is my job to evaluate the risks and report them.	1																					
25	25		301								Lee	...	1																					
26	26		302								I see.	27	It's not the first day you're on my team.	27																				
27	27		301								Lee	...I'm not wasting more time with you.	1																					
28	28		301								Lee	I've sent you the emergency response proposal, if you can just accept it for me.	1
