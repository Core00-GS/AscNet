229	223		301								Celica	The old Nefheim Institute sustained heavy damage, so almost all reports overestimated the casualty counts. But after over two weeks of search and rescue, we have found that the casualty is far below previous estimates.	1

246	240		301								Asimov	Unlike conventional artillery, they were capable of precision attacks. Otherwise, at least half of the people in New Murmansk would have died.	1

248	242		301								Asimov	What I care about the most is how will we view this threat?	1																					
249	243		301								Asimov	Tifa, Metropolis, New Murmansk... After what happened in Metropolis, it is highly likely that they have control over Huaxu.	1																					
250	244		301								Asimov	President, they aren't just a few dozen disorganized soldiers using rusty rifles and lies to catch us off guard.	1																					
251	245		301								Asimov	They've already become a highly organized threat with targeted hostility towards Babylonia.	1

259	253		301								Hassen	You're calling for the complete military mobilization of Babylonia.	1																					
260	254		301								Hassen	I cannot agree to this.	1

320	314		301								Karenina	All of the gravity engines are stalling.	2																					
321	315		301								Karenina	It seems that something is sending them a constant stream of forced shutdown commands.	2																					
322	316		301								Bridget	What?	1																					
323	317		301								Asimov	Even if you ignore this command, it initiates a countdown sequence, which overwrites the normal ignition command.	3																					
324	318		301								Karenina	...Hence the stalling.	2																					
325	319		301								Asimov	As for the source...	3																					
326	320		301								Asimov	...They have to be direct commands from the head of the program, set with the highest priority to circumvent any interference from the fault-tolerant system.	3																					
327	321		301								Karenina	...Call me crazy, but I think there's something wrong with Gestalt.	2

348	342		301								Asimov	Um let me see... Well, this is not what I was expecting, so pardon me while I try to figure out how to phrase it...	2																					
349	343		301								Asimov	Alright, well...	2																					
350	344		202							1					1																			
351	345		203							2	0.25																							
352	346		301								Asimov	As you can see, the ship is at 10% power, and reports show four groups of gravity engines being taken over and locked in to propel in the opposite direction at maximum capacity, causing our rapid descent.	2																					
353	347		301								Asimov	While we speak, Babylonia is plummeting towards the ground at an increasing speed.	2																					
354	348		301								Asimov	The cause of this crisis is unknown. I speculated that it was from an update made to Gestalt... but I have just discovered a vulnerability in the program. I'm sure you understand the seriousness of such ramifications.	2																					
355	349		301								Asimov	I know you have many questions, but there's no time for details. So consider the following an order‚Äî	2																					
356	350		301								Asimov	To identify and solve this problem, I need you to carry out an emergency operation.	2																					
357	351		301								„Ç¢„Ç∑„É¢„Éï	We will use the tactical environment simulation interface, Spear of F.O.S., from the Military Academy as assistance.	2																					
358	352		301								Asimov	As a tactical environment simulation system, it will translate the data in front of you into comprehensible intel and provide tactical evaluations and suggestions.	2																					
359	353		301								Asimov	If the situation allows you to connect directly with Babylonia, it can also provide additional functions... But that depends on what happens on the scene.	2																					
360	354		301								Asimov	However, you will only need to use the graphical interface inside Gestalt for now. We'll talk about the rest later.	2																					
361	355		301								Asimov	The way this works, Gray Raven, is that you will "infiltrate" Gestalt.	2																					
362	356		301								Asimov	In short, I will export your M.I.N.D.s and your commandant's consciousness as virtual programs and upload them into the Gestalt, where you will uncover the issue and resolve it.	2																					
363	357		302								Care to explain?	359	This order seems like an act of desperation!	359	Alright, understood.	358																		
364	358	372	301								Asimov	Of course, a veteran of your caliber can easily understand the situation at hand when I have yet to grasp what is happening.	2																					
365	359		301								Asimov	Huh? Do I really need to explain further... Good grief.	2																					
366	360		301								Asimov	Long story short, Babylonia lacks power and is currently falling out of orbit, as you know.	2																					
367	361		301								Asimov	The fundamental cause is Gestalt blocking ignition commands to the engines.	2																					
368	362		301								Asimov	Now, for some reason, Gestalt has activated strict anti-interference protocols, which are blocking access from all programs.	2																					
369	363		301								Asimov	So I came up with an idea, using your M.I.N.D.s as access channels while using the military exercise version of Spear of F.O.S., a command assistant program, as your graphical interface.	2																					
370	364		301								Asimov	Clear so far? I'll load the Constructs' M.I.N.D.s into the virtual space in the form of a "virtual program," then I'll install authorization on your commandant's terminal.	2																					
371	365		301								Asimov	If you can't wrap your head around it, think of yourselves as characters in a video game, and the commandant is the one on the controller.	2																					
372	366		301								Asimov	Then you infiltrate Gestalt, find out why it triggered the lockdown, and resolve the issue. That's it.	2																					
373	367		301								Asimov	This is the only solution I can think of for our current debacle. We have no other choice.	2																					
374	369		301								Asimov	I will continue to monitor your status and help you locate the vulnerability in Gestalt in real-time. But, enough talking... You'll learn more once you are in the immersion process.	2																					
375	370		301								Asimov	I'll ask one more time. Do you remember everything I just said?	2
