7	7		301								Pulao	Hmm... 【kuroname】, you haven't been to the East District, have you? Let's go. We'll find lots of machine troupes and tricks there.	1

13	13		301							1	Pulao	Something horrible happened? An organized crime? Where and when did it take place? When did it start?	1																					
14	14		301								Pulao	Or, is it some sort of large-scale theft? Did anyone break into the old warehouses?	1																					
15	15		301								Diner	What warehouse? Relax, it's not that bad.	2																					
16	16		301								Diner	But you are half correct. Some things were stolen.	2																					
17	17		301								Diner	Do you know who stole them? It's a ghost!	2																					
18	18		301									He lowers his voice, acting scary. But you and Pulao aren't impressed.																						
19	19		301								Diner	It was not long ago. Ah Kwan from the Shen Team in the East District saw a shadow flashing across the roof when he woke up in the middle of the night.	2																					
20	20		301								Diner	The next day, he lost one of the iron balls that he used for hand exercise.	2																					
21	21		301								Diner	Oh, and Little Pup from the 2nd Alley. He was playing marbles one day, and felt like something flew over his head. But he saw nothing when he looked up.	2																					
22	22		301								Diner	When he looked down, you know what?	2																					
23	23		301								Diner	All his marbles were gone.	2																					
24	24		301								Diner	Many others had also seen the strange shadow and lost things, like little bearing balls, fruit candies, screws and so on.	2																					
25	25		301								Pulao	Why didn't they tell the Pulao Crew?	1																					
26	26		301								Diner	It was just some little, cheap items. Nobody really cared. I only reminded you because you really liked your toys.	2																					
27	27		301								Diner	But when people started talking to one another, they realized the same thing had also happened to others. Then there were rumors about this "strange thing" in the night market that stole things from anyone it met.	2																					
28	28		301									The diner tells the urban legend vividly, but none of it sounds real.

30	30		301								Pulao	I see. Thank you.	1																					
31	31		301								Pulao	Let's go, 【kuroname】.	1																					
32	32		301								Diner	Are you actually...	2																					
33	33		301									The diner seems to have another question. Pulao turns back, puzzled.

40	40		301								Pulao	What do you think, Commandant?	1																					
41	41		302								Something's not right.	42	I believe in science.	44																				
42	42		204							1																								
43	43	46	301								Pulao	I have the same feeling.	1																					
44	44		204							1																								
45	45		301								Pulao	You're right. There is no ghost in the world.	1																					
46	46		301								Pulao	The strangest thing about it is the items stolen. If the thief is after wealth, they aren't worth many Grubs.	1																					
47	47		204							1	12																							
48	48		301								Pulao	Could he be after fame?	1																					
49	49		302								If that's the case, he wouldn't take the kid's marbles.	50																						
50	50		204							1	12																							
51	51		301								Pulao	Hmm, right. He would be challenging safety vaults if he was after fame. Maybe he wanted to cause fear? But people only chit-chat about it now.	1																					
52	52		302								I don't think we need to do anything.	53																						
53	53		301								Pulao	No, Commandant. I need to take a step forward, just like that uncle.	1																					
54	54		301								Pulao	In the past, I missed many things because I only reacted after receiving the report. I can't make the same mistake again. This time, I'm taking the initiative.	1																					
55	55		301								Pulao	No matter how trivial a clue seems, I cannot let it slide away. My job is to keep Kowloong safe and rule out all possible sources of danger, so I can stand in front of everybody with a clear conscience.	1																					
56	56		301								Pulao	Besides, I have additional intel that suggests this case isn't as simple as it seems.	1																					
57	57		302								Is it about the warehouse you mentioned earlier?	58																						
58	58		204							1	11																							
59	59		301								Pulao	Ouch... I shouldn't let it slip out of my mouth...	1																					
60	60		301									Pulao's face shows signs of frustration, but she quickly recovers.																						
61	61		204							1	12																							
62	62		301								Pulao	It's not top secret, so I can let you know, Commandant.	1																					
63	63		301								Pulao	We caught a thief last night. He claimed that his goods were stolen from the East District warehouses.	1																					
64	64		302								Do you think there is a link?	65																						
65	65		301								Pulao	We can't rule out the possibility, right?	1																					
66	66		301								Pulao	But I can't stay with you then. Let me walk you back to the Engineering Force.	1																					
67	67		302								I'll help you.	68																						
68	68		204							1	11																							
69	69		301								Pulao	But you aren't from Kowloong. I can't just...	1																					
70	70		302								It's fine. We fought together to liberate the Nighter, didn't we?	71																						
71	71		204							1																								
72	72		301								Pulao	Now that you say so, I can't reject your offer.	1																					
73	73		301								Pulao	Let's go! To solve the ghost problem in the East District!	1																					
74	74		301									As Pulao raises her fist, all the little prizes on her begin to jingle. Looks like she is going on a field trip rather than investigating a case.																						
75	76		204							1	4																							
76	75		301									Pulao turns back as if she has sensed your doubt. She looks slightly upset.																						
77	77		301								Pulao	That's not very polite of you, Commandant. Do you not believe in my abilities?	1																					
78	78		301									You quickly shake your head and point at the jingling gadgets on her. She immediately understands.

You were worried that your disguise might make your investigation difficult, but people here aren't taking this incident that seriously and are happy to talk about it.																						
86	86		301									Pulao is also playing the role of "Laopu" well, asking questions with curious and innocent eyes. Everybody shares their story generously, some even exaggerating.																						
87	87		301									But...																						
88	88		201							1	500446	14																						
89	89		301							1	Pulao	No clue at all...	1																					
90	90		301									After the interview, you find three more victims who just had something stolen today.																						
91	91		301									First, it's Mr. Wu from the tanghulu stall. He lost the rock sugar used for cooking syrup after seeing the strange shadow.

96	96		301								Wu	When I looked at the corner, I saw a dark shadow. I had no idea what it was.	1																					
97	97		301								Wu	I store rock sugar in a box. When I turned back, a few pieces went missing.	1																					
98	98		301								Wu	I was like what the heck.	1																					
99	99		301								Wu	But I really don't want to make a big fuss about it. It's not like the sugar is anything valuable.	1

103	103		301									Next is Mr. Zhu, a drum performer. He lost the ribbon of his drumsticks after seeing a strange silhouette.

107	107		301							1	Zhu	After the show, I tied the drumsticks to my waist and went for lunch.	1																					
108	108		301								Zhu	But I felt like someone was watching me from above. When I looked up, it had gone behind the roof ridge. I reached for my drumsticks and realized the ribbon was gone. I had to buy the ribbon again. It almost made me late.	1																					
109	109		301								Zhu	Oh, right! The "ghost" I saw was red. It must be a red-faced monster!	1

118	118		301								Zhan	The moment I walked into the shop, I saw a shadow moving inside. Its head was as big as an umbrella!	1																					
119	119		301								Zhan	I had to gather my courage, but when I walked over, I saw nothing. Then my sewing needle was gone.	1																					
120	120		301								Zhan	So freaky. Even if I get the needle back, I don't want it anymore!	1

125	125		301								Pulao	So the warehouse theft was an independent crime. It has nothing to do with the ghost.	1																					
126	126		301								Pulao	What a shame. Everyone was so cooperative...	1																					
127	127		204							1	2																							
128	128		301								Pulao	But we didn't walk around for nothing. Right, Commandant?	1																					
129	129		301									You look at the tanghulu in Pulao's left hand, rattle drum in her right hand and the panda cross-stitch on her waist, then nod hard.																						
130	130		204							1	4																							
131	131		301								Pulao	It has nothing to do with the gifts! I'm talking about the case!	1																					
132	132		204							1	12																							
133	133		301								Pulao	After talking with so many people, I think this is an organized crime.	1																					
134	134		302								Because of the short time interval?	135																						
135	135		301								Pulao	Correct. All the victims were distracted by the shadow first before realizing their things were gone.	1																					
136	136		301								Pulao	Nobody can steal something and run away within such a short time.	1																					
137	137		302								But why all this fuss?	138																						
138	138		301								Pulao	Um... That's one thing I cannot understand. The thief only stole non-valuables, so the victims wouldn't report the incidents to Pulao Crew. As long as Pulao Crew don't show up, nobody would take it seriously... I get it!	1																					
139	139		301								Pulao	Have you heard of the boy who cried wolf, Commandant?	1																					
140	140		302								Yeah, someone once told me the story.	141																						
141	141		301								Pulao	Their real purpose is to let the people in the East District become used to such little theft. They only picked items of little importance because they wouldn't catch Pulao Crew's attention.	1																					
142	142		301								Pulao	At the same time, they will leave an impression that they only take non-valuables. When everyone in the East District gets used to their action, they will make the real move. Maybe the thief I caught earlier was also one of the disguises.	1																					
143	143		204							1	2																							
144	144		301								Pulao	What do you think? Does it make sense?	1																					
145	145		301									Is that really so? You wonder if such a lot of work and effort is worth it.																						
146	146		301									As you think, you feel the day becomes a little darker. When you look up, you see a shadow standing on the roof of a house.																						
147	147		204							1	12																							
148	148		301									Like Miss Zhan said, its head is the size of an umbrella and has some red parts. But before you could see its face, it has disappeared into the shadow on the left.
