3	3		301			DialogEnable						To follow bugged bunny, Nanami rushes into the hidden dimension without thinking twice.																						
4	4		201							1	500091																							
5	5		301							1	Nanami	Eh?!	1																					
6	6		301									Although it is still the ground underneath her feet and the simulated sky above her head, Nanami's senses are clearly under some strange effects, almost causing her to fall over.																						
7	7		301								Nanami	What's going on...	1																					
8	8		301									Nanami moves her limbs, and she can feel something strange within her body, a feeling she has never felt before.																						
9	9		301								Nanami	Has Nanami's frame been hacked? But... isn't this the virtual space...	1																					
10	10		202							1					1																			
11	11		301									Despite she cannot confirm it, Nanami can clearly tell that she is currently within an anomaly separated from the virtual space.																						
12	12		301									Still, she quickly adjusts the sensory input of her frameâ€”after all, as a Construct, her "body" is way more adjustable than a human's.																						
13	13		201							1	500091																							
14	14		301							1	Nanami	Where's the bugged bunny? Did I lose it...	1																					
15	15		301									While Nanami was caught with the strangeness under her skin, the bugged bunny has long disappeared. But now she is certain she is right where she should be.																						
16	16		301								Nanami	No wonder the repair rate of this logical zone has not increased. This anomaly, on the other hand, is constantly expanding...	1																					
17	17		301								Nanami	Even space is warping here... Are none of Gestalt's repair programs working?	1																					
18	18		301									Nanami stops a passing repair program and requests its backup log, but her request is denied.																						
19	19		301								Nanami	Denied...? Is the repair program bugged from the beginning? Then why isn't it deleted...	1																					
20	20		201							1	500296																							
21	21		301							1	"Repair Program"	Delete... Remove... Remove bugs<//CREATE>, our kind queued for deletion! I shall not be deleted<//INSULT>!	1																					
22	22		301									Just the mention of the phrase "deleted" from her has caused the "repair program" to react bizarrely. Nanami's instinct tells her that these programs are not running on their default logic.																						
23	23		301								"Repair Program"	Repair complete<//LOTUS>, our dreams equal true! Our world<//BELLY BUTTON> equals false!	1																					
24	24		201							1	500091																							
25	25		301							1	Nanami	They look just like the repair programs from before, but they seem to possess an independent AI... Why would Gestalt create something like this internally?	1																					
26	26		301									An independent AI appearing inside Gestalt's logical zone is the equivalent of a human's bones and organs gaining their own consciousness. It will certainly result in something unpredictable.																						
27	27		204							1	5																							
28	28		301								Nanami	Gotta tell the mecha babushka to fix this as soon as possible! But the data stream here... is completely cut off from the outside circuit...	1																					
29	29		301									Despite many attempts, Nanami still fails to connect with Gestalt within the anomaly, and so she cannot submit the error report.																						
30	30		301								Nanami	Curiouser and curiouser. Still, I better return to the normal virtual space...	1																					
31	31		202							1					1																			
32	32		301								???	Oh dear<//TICK-TOCK>! Oh dear<//TICK-TOCK>! I shall be too late<//TICK-TOCK>!																						
33	33		301									Just as Nanami is about to turn around to look for the entrance barrier of the anomaly, she finds the bugged bunny running past from afar.																						
34	34		201							1	500091	5																						
35	35		301							1	Nanami	Aah! Bugged bunny!	1																					
36	36		301									The bunny turns and sees Nanami, and then it runs further into the depths of the anomaly.																						
37	37		301								Nanami	What to do, what to do... Should I go after the bunny, or should I return to hand in a report?	1																					
38	38		301								Nanami	Well... if I let it run away this time, I might never be able to find it again! That won't do!	1																					
39	39		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Nanami lowers her body, the wheels under her feet spinning expeditiously, and she is off chasing after the bugged bunny.
