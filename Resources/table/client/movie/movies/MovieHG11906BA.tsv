5	5		301									If the letters are not piled up in the cabinet, you might even think that this person is but a figment of your imagination.																						
6	6		301									Time flies.																						
7	7		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Everything to do with that girl has been buried in a corner of your mind.

10	10		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Until one day...																						
11	11		301									A letter equally strange and familiar arrives in your mailbox.																						
12	12		301									It comes across as strange because the envelope and paper used are too coarse, and there is even dirt on them.																						
13	13		301									At the same time, the handwriting is familiar, for it has been etched into your memory.																						
14	14		301									The content of the letter is exceedingly simple.																						
15	15		301									It bears only location coordinates and a dried iris.																						
16	17		301									However, the letter unlocks a dam of long-forgotten memories, and the words of past letters written gush forth, filling your mind.																						
17	18		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					It all feels like it happened yesterday.																						
18	19		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory256.png																								
19	20		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You carry out a private investigation into the coordinates and find that they are close to a recovered city.																						
20	21		301									There are no Corrupted, nor are there high levels of the Punishing Virus.																						
21	22		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You prepare yourself to head out to the coordinates on your own.

24	25		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						This is probably an abandoned opera house.																						
25	26		301									Even though it's already been reduced to ruins, the place still has a certain charm to it.																						
26	27		301									It's completely silent. The only light is from the moon, shining down through the hole in the roof.

32	33		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You step into the opera house. She has her back to you, standing under the moonlight.																						
33	34		301									Hearing the sound of footsteps, the girl slowly turns around.																						
34	35		201							1	500291	1																						
35	36		301							1		A pair of iris-colored eyes gaze at me.	1																					
36	37		301									Iris was right.	1																					
37	38		301									Even though the two of you have never met, you both immediately know that she is the one who has been waiting for you, and you, her.	1																					
38	39		202							1																								
39	40		301									The girl doesn't speak, but holds out her hand.																						
40	41		301									There is no need for questions nor words. When she reaches out to you, you know what it means.																						
41	42		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You put your hand in hers and cannot help shivering from its coldness.

44	45		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						But she does not let go. She starts gently humming a song, leading me into a slow dance.																						
45	46		301									The tune is languid and gentle, like a whisper between lovers.																						
46	47		301									There is a bit of stumbling around at the beginning, but she takes your clumsiness in stride, firmly but gently guiding you through the steps.																						
47	48		301									And so you slowly get the hang of her rhythm.																						
48	49		301									Just as she has said in her letter, she is an amazing lead.																						
49	50		301									Or perhaps you should say that she has become an amazing lead.																						
50	51		301									Suddenly, there's a change in pitch and the rhythm becomes tenser and more passionate.																						
51	52		301									She has also changed roles, moving from lead to follow, leaving herself in your hands.																						
52	53		301									And so you have to change your role too, mimicking her steps from before as the lead.																						
53	54		301									The funny thing is that it is not at all exhausting. It seems that you will always know what the next step is when you dance with her.																						
54	55		301									It is just like those years when you comforted her, encouraged her, watched over her, and guided her.																						
55	56		301									You tilt your head, looking straight at her.																						
56	57		301									Those clear, bright eyes gaze right back at you.																						
57	58		301									Her eyes no longer hold the innocence she once had, but the romance still alive.																						
58	59		301									She's changed, yet remained the same.																						
59	60		301									The only thing you can be sure of is...																						
60	61		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					That one step away, that distance between us, has now been traversed.
