6	6		301			DialogEnable				1	Vera	Is it really that easy? We simply arrived at the Demon General's Castle by destroying the Demons along the way.	1																					
7	7		301								Karenina	There weren't any split paths. Some looked like open roads, but there were invisible barriers.	2																					
8	8		301								Camu	It's easier this way. When Kamui was playing games, I often wanted to stop him from doing all those repetitive side quests.	3																					
9	9		301								Vera	Like the errand quests you talked about?	1																					
10	10		301								Camu	Some were even refreshed on a daily basis. I mean, they were all single player games, so what was the point of these boring tasks? What were those designers thinking?	3																					
11	11		301								Karenina	They just wanted to keep the players occupied, I guess.	2																					
12	12		301									Talking like real game designers, the trio completely ignored the traps in the castle and continued walking forward.																						
13	13		301									Not like they could easily find where the traps were.																						
14	14		301									They didn't even care if the traps were triggered or not.																						
15	15		301									According to Camu, this was called "HP management", which was often used by Kamui when he played games.																						
16	16		301								Camu	In RPGs, traps usually do not kill the player instantly. So as long as we keep using recovery potions, we can step on as many traps as we like.	3																					
17	17		301									The key to this method is recovery potions, which they just got a lot by killing monsters.																						
18	18		301									I watched their HP bars turning from green to red, then green again.																						
19	19		301									—What a boring way to play.																						
20	20		301								Karenina	I see a hall in front. There shouldn't be any more traps, right?	2																					
21	21		301									Karenina stormed through the trap area, followed by Camu and Vera.																						
22	22		301								Karenina	Hurry up, Gray Raven. This is obviously a plot that is only triggered when all the team members have arrived.	2																					
23	1000		302								Be right there.	23	Could we have a little more role playing?	24																				
24	23	25	301								Karenina	Hmph, now the first Demon General won't escape our hands.	2																					
25	24	25	301								Karenina	Role playing? Talk to me about role playing after those traps can one-hit kill us.	2

27	25		301			PanelActor1Shake						I quickly passed the corridor full of (triggered) traps. There was a loud noise behind me.																						
28	26		301									The corridor and all the other passages were closed, locking us inside this hall—
