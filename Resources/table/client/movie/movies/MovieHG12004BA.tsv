12	12		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The library contains books and articles from the Golden Age, many of which are said to be the WGAA's donations. Many materials inaccessible at the Center of Basic Public Education have their original copies stored here.																						
13	13		301									—A privilege for the students who are about to confront the real world.																						
14	14		301									But they are rarely read. Students here are always busy—they can recite the three fundamental contradictions of a military system, but they do not have time to ponder the long-term effect of technological revolutions.																						
15	15		301									The library thus becomes a place to self-assess instead of a place for more knowledge.																						
16	16		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Only a few students are here now because of the ceremony. You do not cause any commotion when you enter with Chrome, unlike before.

19	19		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Returning to a familiar place has awoken your muscle memory. It guides you as you lead Chrome to the second floor.																						
20	20		301									The library would always be filled to the brim back then, right before tests and exams.																						
21	21		301									But there is a place on the second floor that is always free from disruption. Hidden behind a few shelves is a haven only a few know about.																						
22	22		301									Every student has their preferred spot in the library, and this one is yours.																						
23	23		301									Chrome has not said anything on the way here. He just follows behind you quietly.																						
24	24		301									He does not seem to be curious why you have led him straight here after you entered the library.																						
25	25		301									Instead, he acts as if he knows this route like the back of his hand. At one of the corners, he turns the correct way before you even take a step,																						
26	26		301									When you reach your destination, he does not sit down. Instead, he walks to the shelf to the side, his finger gliding across the spines of the books.																						
27	27		301									His long and slender finger stops precisely at one of the hardcover books. Gently with the tip of his finger, he pulls and removes the book from the shelf before heading to the seat opposite you, opening it as he sits down.																						
28	28		301									The title of the book has been scrubbed unrecognizable. Chrome holds the book with familiarity as if he has just retrieved a book he was halfway through and returned to the shelf yesterday.																						
29	29		302								You know this place well?	30																						
30	30		301									You cannot help but ask.																						
31	31		301									He purses his lips.																						
32	32		201							1	500309																							
33	33		301							1	Chrome	As much as you do, I imagine.	1																					
34	34		301									There is no need for more words. You have both picked up that you were "regulars" here from the sense of familiarity in each other's movement and action.																						
35	35		202							1					1																			
36	36		301									Chrome holds a finger before his lips and makes the hush gesture.																						
37	37		201							1	500309																							
38	38		301							1	Chrome	We should lower our voices. Don't disturb the juniors.	1																					
39	39		202							1					1																			
40	40		301									You try to lower the sound of your chuckles.																						
41	41		301									How incredible life is.																						
42	42		301									To run into someone who has grown up as similar as you have, but ends up somewhere so drastically different from where you are.																						
43	43		201							1	500309																							
44	44		301							1	Chrome	When I was a student here, I loved to study in this spot before the tests.	1																					
45	45		301									He says quietly as he flips through the book in his hand.																						
46	46		302								I like it here too. It's quiet.	47																						
47	47		301								Chrome	Exactly. Not many knew of this place either, so I didn't have to worry about having my spot taken.	1																					
48	48		301									He quiets down for a moment before speaking again.																						
49	49		301								Chrome	I must admit I was a little surprised at first. I didn't think you would know this spot.	1																					
50	50		302								Of course I do. I've seen sunsets and sunrises on this very chair.	51																						
51	51		301								Chrome	...Can't imagine a Chief-graduate like you would study overnight in the library for a test.	1																					
52	52		302								You're a Chief as well.	53																						
53	53		301								Chrome	My apologies. I shouldn't have neglected your efforts just because of your title.	1																					
54	54		302								That's alright.	55																						
55	55		301								Chrome	It's not. Even if you don't mind me overstepping, I cannot forgive myself that easily.	1																					
56	56		202							1					1																			
57	57		301									Chrome suddenly puts down his book and stands up.																						
58	58		201							1	500309																							
59	59		301							1	Chrome	Please wait here.	1																					
60	60		401							2	1516																							
61	61		202							1																								
62	62		301									He bows his head toward you before hastily walking away.																						
63	63		301									...																						
64	64		301									Chrome has not technically been away for long, but from where you are sitting, eternity seems to have passed.																						
65	65		301									Bored, you glance at the book Chrome left on the desk.																						
66	66		301									It is still open where Chrome left it.																						
67	67		301									—Every complicated question has an answer that is simple, concise, and wrong.																						
68	68		301									—The duality and uncertainty of the future could be an argument for us to consider how the technological revolution will impact politics and wars.																						
69	69		301									—Not only have revolutionary technologies been implemented into wars, but they are also done on an unprecedented scale. There will be consequences unanticipated.																						
70	70		301									—Which is to say, the distant future will follow the ebbs and flows of history as it unfolds here and now.																						
71	71		301									More similar lines and paragraphs cover the pages.																						
72	72		301									Right then, Chrome is back.																						
73	73		301									He returns with two paper cups in his hands. Noticing that you are reading the book he was going through, he thinks nothing of it and places one of the cups before you.																						
74	74		301									You pick it up with both hands, staring at the dark brown liquid inside.																						
75	75		302								Double Espresso?	76																						
76	76		201							1	500309																							
77	77		301							1	Chrome	That's right. Think of it as my "apology."	1																					
78	78		302								That is quite a...	79																						
79	79		301								Chrome	You might not like it, but I bet you must "miss" it.	1																					
80	80		302								Fair.	81																						
81	81		202							1					1																			
82	82		301									No students who study overnight do not require a shot of caffeine to keep their eyes open.																						
83	83		301									It seems to be a default now for schools to have a cafe next to the library.																						
84	84		301									An appropriate apology indeed, all things considered.																						
85	85		301									The warmth in your hand represents years of hardship no one realizes.																						
86	86		301									—No. Someone does.																						
87	87		301									Chrome has already emptied his cup. His brows do not even furrow, seemingly long accustomed to its bitterness.																						
88	88		301									In an instant, you recognize all the hardship behind his halo of glory.																						
89	89		301									And so, you empty yours as well.																						
90	90		301									You stack your cups and push them to the side.																						
91	91		201							1	500309																							
92	92		301							1	Chrome	Are you interested in this book?	1																					
93	93		301									Chrome picks up the book and motions it your way.																						
94	94		302								Yeah.	95																						
95	95		301								Chrome	It's an old book from the Golden Age, I think.	1																					
96	96		301								Chrome	It's about the impacts of the technological revolution.	1																					
97	97		301								Chrome	Despite being published such a long time ago, the ideas and arguments in it can still be applied today.	1																					
98	98		301								Chrome	Before I left the college, I was reading this book leisurely outside of classes.	1																					
99	99		301								Chrome	But the truth is I couldn't fully grasp what it was trying to say back then.	1																					
100	100		301								Chrome	Looking back, I think I finally understand it now.	1																					
101	101		302								Tell me.	102																						
102	102		301									He seems to have expected your question, and he nods before you complete your question.																						
103	103		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Chrome	Alright.	1
