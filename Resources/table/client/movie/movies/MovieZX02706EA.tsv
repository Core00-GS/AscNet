3	3		301			DialogEnable						The delivery droid belonged to a new line of sustainable delivery mechanoids from a logistics company, but the Punishing Virus had spread to their location before they were launched.																						
4	4		301									It was abandoned deep within a warehouse until some humans broke in, looking for supplies and waking it up.																						
5	5		301									It retained its original command, even when there were no more humans requesting its service. Still, it continued to drag its human-battered body around the city, looking for things it could deliver.																						
6	6		301									It was drawn by the murals on the walls. All the machines said they were revelations left by "Sage".																						
7	7		301									One day, it saw a strange mechanoid before an unfinished mural. She enthusiastically painted beautiful colors on the wall, clapping and cheering when she completed it.																						
8	8		301									Noticing the hidden delivery droid, she reached out and patted it, and in an instant, it understood "warmth" for the first time.																						
9	9		301									The girl did not say who she was, but the delivery droid was certain that she was the "Sage" every machine was talking about.																						
10	10		301									"Sage" was deeply invested in the heritage of humanity. She spent a whole day searching for "treasures" in the mall, gathering other machines there to play "role-playing" games.																						
11	11		301									The delivery droid did not understand what the games meant, but it could feel the joy in her heart, a feeling so overwhelming that even the hole in its heart was filled.																						
12	12		301									The girl left soon after, however. She waved goodbye and said, "Nanami had a really good time. Bye-bye!" before stepping into the sunset.																						
13	13		301									If they collected enough of the things she liked, would Sage return someday?																						
14	14		301									So it began gathering what humans had left behind: art, books, games, toys... and it brought them back to their headquarters.																						
15	15		301									These "offerings" it collected have since sat there neatly in the warehouse, waiting for their master to return.

17	17		301							1	Deli	Now that we have a larger collection than when Sage first arrived, she is going to have an even better time.	1																					
18	18		301								Deli	But she never came back. Is that because she has yet to find the "key item"?	1																					
19	19		301								Deli	And my companions... None of them has returned.	1																					
20	20		301									Confused, the delivery droid stands amidst the "offerings" and the remains of the machines.

23	23		301							1	Haicma	...What do your companions look like?	2																					
24	24		301								Deli	They are all the same model of delivery droid as me.	1																					
25	25		301									Haicma has noticed the delivery droid acting strange since they entered the mall.																						
26	26		301									Not only is its GPS malfunctioning, but it also has not been able to recognize its companions.																						
27	27		301									Infected by the Punishing Virus, corrupted machines cannot emit the same identification signal as the delivery droid. Even though they were standing before it, it could not recognize its old companions.																						
28	28		301									Haicma had destroyed all of the Corrupted right in front of the delivery droid. Their remains scatter around the two of them.																						
29	29		204							2	10																							
30	30		301								Haicma	...	2																					
31	31		301								Deli	Is there something wrong?	1																					
32	32		301									She should tell it everything, but she cannot.																						
33	33		204							2																								
34	34		301								Haicma	...Nothing. Your collection... I think she'll like it.	2																					
35	35		301								Haicma	I'm also searching for "Sage". It's my... purpose.	2																					
36	36		301									Haicma walks to a corner of the warehouse, crouching and touching the mural surrounded by "offerings."																						
37	37		301									Part of the mural was done later than the other. The slightly older part reveals pure joy as if the painter wanted to share her bliss with others.																						
38	38		301									The newer part depicts a small girl and a group of mechanoids. It reminds Haicma of a painting Nanami did and her smile back then.																						
39	39		301									Where is she now? What has she been through?																						
40	40		204							2	10																							
41	41		301									Haicma closes her eyes, allowing the feeling of "longing" floods over her.																						
42	42		301								Deli	If you find her, can you tell her that we are waiting for her here?	1																					
43	43		204							2																								
44	44		301								Haicma	I will. I'll tell her that Deli has been waiting for her.	2																					
45	45		301								Deli	Thank you! I will look after this place until she comes back!	1																					
46	46		301									Haicma reaches out and pats the mechanoid's head.																						
47	47		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Deli watches Haicma quietly, its transparent lens seemingly reflecting another figure it misses so dearly.

50	50		301			DialogEnable						Before she goes, Haicma helps Deli tidy the warehouse. She puts the remains of the other delivery droids together on a soft foam mat, their bodies leaning and lying on top of each other as if they are resting in peace.

52	52		301							1		The only standing delivery droid does not stop waving at Haicma as she bows her head and says goodbye.																						
53	53		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					It watches the female figure walking further and further away until she disappears, stepping into the sunset.
