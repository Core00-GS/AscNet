15	15		301							1	Chrome	Didn't expect the "helpers" Chaofeng mentioned to be the Gray Raven Squad, though. I wonder if your superiors already knew?	2																					
16	16		301								Murray	I only found out myself just now. How did my brother's crew get here? They should have been on missions in a different area.	1																					
17	17		301								Chrome	By the way, Murray, are you not going to greet Lee and the other Gray Ravens?	2																					
18	18		301								Murray	It's fine, I'm happy just watching my brother from afar. Besides, it's kind of fun like this.	1

22	22		301									A considerable number of people have gathered at the trade venue, and mechanical puppets on patrol. With every new "construct display" that appears on stage, the crowd oohs and ahhs.

24	24		301							1	Chrome	They're all trapped in this place, yet they're excited as ever for this event. Are they being controlled—or are they poisoned by this dream?	1

26	26		301								Drawn-Out voice	Our next item is—																						
27	27		301									Chrome is still deep in thought when the mechanical puppet MC announces the next number—Kamui's. Kamui and Murray turn to look at the stage.

36	36		301							1	Murray	Heh, so I guess my brother's squad had the same idea.	1																					
37	37		301									Murray seems to be enjoying this, while Chrome is checking for potential threats through his specialized device. He glances at the stage to see—

44	44		202							1					1																			
45	45		301									As much as Chrome wants to yell at Kamui, all he can do is gesture wildly at him to stop acting so "unladylike."																						
46	46		301									...To which Kamui flashes Chrome a thumbs-up.																						
47	47		201							1	500147																							
48	48		301							1	Kamui	Lucia, Chrome is telling me to beat you in this.	1

68	68		301								Chrome	It must be Qu, the person Chaofeng mentioned.	2																					
69	69		301								Murray	My brother—I mean, Gray Raven—probably has something planned. Should we make a distraction for them?	1

75	75		301								Performer Puppets	—																						
76	76		301									Lucia's crew has taken Qu.																						
77	77		301									The mechanical puppets have Chrome and Kamui surrounded, while the Kowloong Crew are pursuing the Gray Raven squad.																						
78	78		201							1	500144																							
79	79		301							1	Chaofeng	Gray Raven's destination should be the main control room as well. Let's take out these puppets and head over.	1
