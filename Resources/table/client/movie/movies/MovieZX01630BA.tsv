4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Lee	This ring-shaped underground facility consists of different sectors that serve different purposes, including the Living Area, the Armament Area, and the Industrial Area.	1																					
5	5		301								Lee	All of them were built encircling the Core Area, and from what the blueprint told us, each of them consists of a pathway to the Core.	1																					
6	6		301								Lee	We've entered through Area B, which is designated as the Industrial Area.	1																					
7	7		301								Lee	The underground center of the Core Area is in charge of all the operations in this facility, including power, production, defense, and signal disguises...	1																					
8	8		301								Lee	Which means...	1																					
9	9		302								Huaxu is probably in the Core Area.	11

11	11		301							1	Lucia	Then the question now is how do we get there.	1

13	13		301									Following Lucia's gaze, you find the Industrial Area in front of you obstructed by multiple platforms, each requiring unlocking a connecting passage before you can reach the bridge that takes you to the Core.																						
14	14		302								Lee, any thoughts?	15																						
15	15		301									Lee does not answer. Instead, he tries to activate the operation console on the platform.																						
16	16		201							1	500026																							
17	17		301							1	Lee	...Of course it doesn't work. It requires a special identification for platform management.	1																					
18	18		301								Lee	We can always try to brute force the decryption, but that will cost us a lot of time.	1																					
19	19		301								Lee	Huaxu's message might be gibberish, but it was sent adhering to Babylonia's guide on rescue requests on the emergency frequency. It can't be a coincidence.	1																					
20	20		301								Lee	If the message was a clue left for us, and it was unauthorized by Luna, having not heard from Huaxu for such a long time means Luna has discovered what's going on.	1																					
21	21		201							1	500166																							
22	22		301							1	Lucia	...We're running out of time.	1

25	25		301							1	Murray	Lee, Commandant, please listen to me.	1																					
26	26		301								Murray	If we use the Spear of F.O.S. to examine the access history of these operation consoles, maybe we can find a way to open the passages.	1

33	33		302								You have the highest clearance level?	34																						
34	34		301								Murray	Ugh... As my brother said, this isn't time for protocols. I'm sure Hassen will understand.	1																					
35	35		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Murray	Just leave it to me.	1
