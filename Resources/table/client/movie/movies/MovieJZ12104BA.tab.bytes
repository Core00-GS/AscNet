8	8		301								No. 20	Ugh... Don't you like doing anything?	2																					
9	9		301								No. 20	Like I wanna read tons of books... I wanna wear tons of clothes! I wanna go to the beach! I wanna lay in a field of flowers. I wanna...	2																					
10	10		301									The girl before her begins counting the number of things she wants to do on her fingertips.																						
11	11		301									No. 21 has never read a book. She has never worn any other clothes. She does not know what a "beach" is. She has never seen a field of flowers.																						
12	12		204							1	3																							
13	13		301								No. 21	When I leave... what do I want to do...?	1																					
14	14		301									No. 21 struggles to think of something. All she knows is what is written on her daily schedule. If there is anything that she could hope for, it might be new colors or smells other than what was in the institute.																						
15	15		301									No. 21 sees her reflection in No. 20's glimmering eyes, and she finds herself muted and dull.

18	18		301								No. 20	Huh? What'd you say?	2

20	20		301								No. 20	Huh?	2																					
21	21		301								No. 21	Complete all the experiments. That's what I want to do.	1																					
22	22		301								No. 20	That's so boring! You're just like all the other test subjects! All you guys think about is completing experiments.	2																					
23	23		301									No. 21 looks down. She does not quite understand what No. 20 is talking about, nor does she understand where the twinkle in her eyes comes from, or even why No. 20 behaves so differently from her.																						
24	24		301									She looks at the back of her hand. A bruise had formed after such a long period attached to an IV, and it's covered with medical tape. She never thought about what she should do if she left the institute, because she had no answer. Someone else would tell her what to do. She just needs to do it.																						
25	25		301								No. 20	Anyway... Even if you don't know, you'll leave the institute soon enough.	2																					
26	26		301								No. 20	It's almost time for my modification surgery... You might be a bit of an airhead, but I still don't wanna leave you.	2

36	36		301									Vera interrupts No. 21's recollection. She looks up to see Vera standing at the entrance to the training room. Her eyebrows are raised as she asks.																						
37	37		301								No. 21	...The hand is at the six, so I woke up and started the mission.	2																					
38	38		301								Vera	Huh? You mean 6 o'clock?	1																					
39	39		301									Vera looks at the clock hanging on the wall in the training room. The clock reads 10 o'clock, meaning No. 21 had been sitting here for several hours.																						
40	40		301								Vera	Next time you get here so early, start training by yourself.	1																					
41	41		301								No. 21	Oh. Understood.	2																					
42	42		301								Vera	Also, when I say something, you better listen up. Don't make me tell you a second time.	1																					
43	43		301								No. 21	Oh... Okay.	2																					
44	44		301								Vera	Well, let's begin. Put this on and warm up.	1																					
45	45		301									Vera throws her a small M.I.N.D. simulator. She follows Vera's instructions and attaches it to her temples.

53	53		301								No. 21	Where am I?	2																					
54	54		301								Vera	It's just a simulated environment. Don't worry just yet...	1																					
55	55		401							1	40																							
56	56		301									No. 21 smells the air. She smells a hot, arid scent along with other peculiar smells. Her whole body is tense and excited by all the novelties around her.																						
57	57		301								Vera	Let's make a few things clear. One, listen to all of my commands when we're in battle. Two...	1																					
58	58		301									No. 21 hears a faint sound from behind a rock. Turning around quickly, a mechanoid springs out from behind and rushes toward her.

67	67		401							2	10002001																							
68	68		301									Vera unsheathes her blade. After a fierce clash, another mechanoid falls to the ground.

70	70		201							1	500168	13																						
71	71		301							1	Vera	Don't get in my way.	1																					
72	72		301									Vera pulls out her blade from the back of the mechanoid's head, and smiles arrogantly. Her red eyes twinkle with a light more radiant than the distant sun. Her red frame glows like a goddess emerging out of flames.																						
73	73		301									The intense red dazzles No. 21's eyes. Her heart begins to race again. A voice in the depths of her M.I.N.D. screams for more.																						
74	74		201							1	500328	5																						
75	75		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	No. 21	...Understood.	1																					
76	76		202							1	2				1																			
77	77		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Vera finally realizes that No. 21 does indeed have unparalleled talent on the battlefield. She fights with the frenzy of a beast in an arena.																						
78	78		301									This is a sharp contrast from the clueless new recruit she had seen earlier.																						
79	79		301									No. 21's synergy with the Co-Bot is far greater than any team Vera had witnessed in Kurono. The silly little robot functions as an extension of herself.																						
80	80		301									...At the same time, as their training progressed, she begins to uncover No. 21's issues in battle.																						
81	81		301									No. 21 has no understanding of the concept of "defense," nor does she know how to fight together with others.																						
82	82		301									As soon as she engages in combat, she becomes a rabid dog without a leash. She ignores orders and is unable to restrain herself. She fights without discretion until all Corrupted are destroyed.																						
83	83		301									Her combat module seems to only have one command: kill everything.																						
84	84		201							1	500168																							
85	85		301							1	Vera	Enough... No. 21, stop!	1

87	87		301							1	No. 21	Hiss‚Äî	1																					
88	88		301			RImgBg1Shake						Right as No. 21's pupils narrow, she pounces on the nearest Corrupted. The Co-Bot traps the Corrupted in a force field, then the laser cannon floating beside her fires a beam of light, blowing up the Corrupted.																						
89	89		201							1	500168																							
90	90		301							1	Vera	...Just great.	1																					
91	91		301									Vera has no intention of stopping the combat simulation. Her first priority is to put the rabid dog on a leash.																						
92	92		301									Vera slashes an attacking Corrupted with her blade as she tries to close in on No. 21.																						
93	93		301									Sensing someone approach, No. 21 roars menacingly and launches an attack on Vera, unable to distinguish friend from foe.																						
94	94		401							2	10007501																							
95	95		401							2	10002001																							
96	96		301			PanelActor1Shake						Vera blocks the blast from No. 21's laser cannon, then leans back to avoid the following blow from the Co-Bot. Right as the Co-Bot passes by, she throws her blade with all her might. The flying blade pierces through the Co-Bot's mechanical arm and nails it firmly to the ground.

107	107		301									No. 21 doesn't excel at close-ranged combat, unlike Vera, who is in her element.																						
108	108		401							2	1512																							
109	109		301									Vera clenches No. 21's throat from behind, restrains her arm behind her back, and knees the back of her leg.

113	113		301									Vera secures her tightly, holding her head close to No. 21's ear.

134	134		301									The surrounding environment changes rapidly, turning back into the empty training room. The only sound is of the two Constructs struggling to catch their breath.																						
135	135		301									Vera relaxes her hold on No. 21, who sits motionlessly on the floor.																						
136	136		301								Vera	Came to your senses, huh?	1																					
137	137		401							2	558																							
138	138		301									Vera pulls out her weapon sticking out of the Co-Bot. It twitches as it exudes a wisp of black smoke.

157	157		301								Vera	On your feet. Keep going.	2																					
158	158		301									The tone in her voice... it sounds like there is nothing she cannot do. For some reason, No. 21 cannot help but believe what the Construct before her is saying. Is it because of her threatening color? Or the light in her eyes?

227	227		301								Vera	Why are you drinking that?	1																					
228	228		301								No. 21	Because you do.	2																					
229	229		301									Sitting beside No. 21, Vera resists the urge to smack her. Instead, she channels her anger into setting her own cup of tea forcefully on the table.																						
230	230		301								Vera	Just do what I do in combat. Not everything else!	1																					
231	231		301								No. 21	...Oh.	2

235	235		301								Vera	I wasted an hour of my sleep because of you. Look at me like that again, and I'll cut you.	1																					
236	236		301								No. 21	Time to start combat training.	2																					
237	237		301								Vera	Are you really trying to hurry me along?	1																					
238	238		301								No. 21	...	2																					
239	239		301								Vera	For today's training, you need to learn to stop fighting at a moment's notice. If you can't, you'll just get thrown out with the trash.	1

248	248		301								Vera	Out of my way.	2																					
249	249		301								???	Who knows, you might actually cry when you lose her.	1																					
250	250		301									Vera pulls out her blade. No. 21 arches her back and snarls, threateningly. The Co-Bot somehow manages to sneak up behind them and jumps on one of their heads, clasping his head with its mechanical arm.

262	262		301							1		No. 21 glares at the Constructs. Her cold eyes make the Constructs tremble.
