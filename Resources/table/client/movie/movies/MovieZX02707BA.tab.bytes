17	17		301								MPA-01	Understood.

19	19		301								MPA-01	...Her character is constantly reshaping. Her personality data is normal.																						
20	20		301								MPA-01	Currently, her thought process and behavioral logic are akin to a human's. Out of the twelve humanoid subjects, only Nanami has shown this trait.																						
21	21		301								Female Researcher	That's right... She's special.	1																					
22	22		301								MPA-01	I switched to Personality 134 in order to have a more effective conversation and record changes in her emotions.				1																		
23	23		301								MPA-01	But she questioned my behavior, believing I was not talking to her "as myself."				1

27	27		301								MPA-01	I have performed self-test on all my modules, but I have not detected any anomalies. This happenstance did not occur in my conversation with other subjects.																						
28	28		301								Female Researcher	It seems that... only she can notice the difference.	1																					
29	29		301								Female Researcher	In that case, do as she said. Talk to her "as yourself."	1																					
30	30		301								MPA-01	Understood.																						
31	31		301								Female Researcher	...You called her name instead of her code, didn't you? You never did that with other subjects.	1

49	49		301								Male Researcher	How is our information created, cataloged, stored, and updated? Are these systems applicable to machines?	1

55	55		301								Person In Suit	Machines are tools at the end of the day, aren't they?	2																					
56	56		301								Person In Suit	Can you guarantee that this phenomenon is under control? Once machines possess "free will"... Don't forget that the machine consciousness experiment was launched to negate that risk.	2																					
57	57		301								Person In Suit	We are preparing for the future.	2																					
58	58		301								Male Researcher	If the essence of the universe is information, then the codes in computer programs can also be considered a form of life.	1																					
59	59		301								Male Researcher	Isn't that one of the reasons why the Science Council named their Super AI "Gestalt"?	1																					
60	60		301								Male Researcher	If we only try to control instead of understanding them, humankind will certainly be destroyed by their own hubris.	1

81	81		301			DialogEnable				1		Haicma opens her eyes.																						
82	82		301									Ever since she received her new body, she has been periodically "falling asleep."																						
83	83		301									Once a vast administrative AI, she is just a mechanoid now, wandering on Earth with no researchers maintaining her or powerful processors to help organize her thoughts.																						
84	84		301									Therefore, she has chosen to shut down most of her frame's functions at certain times, sleeping in a safe place and performing maintenance.																						
85	85		301									She would scan her old memories during so, repairing memory data that she finds important and organizing the fragmented pieces, almost as if she is "dreaming."																						
86	86		301									Confirming that her parts are running as intended, Haicma stands up and stretches her stiff body.																						
87	87		301									A long time seems to have passed since she fell asleep, and her surroundings have changed. Leaves fall from her body, and as she sweeps away the dry leaves around her, she remembers falling asleep by the latest graffiti found.																						
88	88		301									"Sage's" murals have also been changing. They are no longer simply colorful expressions of her feelings and depictions of the new friends she made, but also information about humans and observations on nature.																						
89	89		301									Haicma is basically certain that the girl she has been searching for is the person who left these murals behind.																						
90	90		301									She has traveled a long way following the graffiti. She has seen seasons change, sunrises and moonsets, morning dew forming then evaporating, snow covering fallen leaves, and seeds sprouting as it melts, paving a green trail.																						
91	91		301									Guided by the murals, Haicma feels everything in her journey. Her behavior gradually grows more spontaneous, such as insisting on stopping somewhere high on nights with a clear sky and plentiful stars.																						
92	92		301									She no longer searches for books Nanami might be interested in for location data only. She does it to further understand the humans Nanami is interested in, and so she would also stay at all kinds of human heritage sites.																						
93	93		301									Right now, Haicma is standing in an abandoned library. She was reading the books stored here before she went to sleep.																						
94	94		301								Haicma	Is that why you're so interested in human culture?	1																					
95	95		301									The ideas and cultures humankind has left behind are so different, so vast, and so everchanging.																						
96	96		301									The diverse ways humankind could perceive the world were why their ideas created so many sparks, generating even more possibilities.																						
97	97		301									Those complex and glistening possibilities created a beautiful vision of the future. The storm-weathered ruins tell of the glorious age humans were in as they headed closer toward that bright future every day.																						
98	98		301								Haicma	Row 3, column 78. Starting here.	1																					
99	99		301								Haicma	"...The fatal flaw of machines‚Äîthe flaw that saves humanity from being ruled by them‚Äîis that they cannot predict the evershifting possibility of the human world."	1																					
100	100		301								Haicma	...	1																					
101	101		301									Slowly walking along the shelves, Haicma searches for books that are legible and less damaged.																						
102	102		301									That is when she notices a familiar name. She steps forward, taking a book from an unassuming shelf.																						
103	103		301									On the title page is a name that belongs to a famous machine consciousness researcher from the Golden Age. The author's picture on the foldout is blurry beyond recognition save for a gentle smile and blonde hair.																						
104	104		301									Haicma knows that smile. She flips open the book.																						
105	105		301									‚ÄîCan humanity consider machines their "children"? Despite all the theories that deem machines anti-human and destructive, we cannot deny the importance they have bestowed.																						
106	106		301									‚ÄîJust like how our children are our legacy, the machines we built are also the extensions of us.																						
107	107		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					‚ÄîThey are nonetheless approaching life from a different angle. We should think about how we can establish more meaningful relationships with them. After all, as our children, they are our pride.

121	121		301									She has so many questions. Even when she knows the objective definition of every emotion, she still cannot truly understand all that is to be a human.																						
122	122		301									But an intense curiosity surges in her mind. She desperately wants to ask her creator something, but she fails to compose the right question.																						
123	123		301									Most of the machines she has met on her journey are simply repeating the commands they received from humans, mimicking human behaviors.																						
124	124		301									Humanity first crawled in the wild before they walked and learned to run. Created by humans, machines are following humanity's footsteps, but they are sprinting‚Äîthey are evolving so much faster than their creators.																						
125	125		301									And when disaster struck, humans began to fear their creations and abandoned them, now hiding among the stars.																						
126	126		301									The machines left behind began to search for their purposes. That was when they encountered a special guide. She was kind and patient, teaching them things they never knew.																						
127	127		301									‚ÄîBecause the machines have always believed that "Sagemachina" will show them the way.																						
128	128		301									What is the future the creators of machines are expecting?
