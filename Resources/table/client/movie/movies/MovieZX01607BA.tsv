8	8		301								Liv	The results of the scan show that... the area is calm. Not even a single trace of the regular programs is detected.	1																					
9	9		301								Lee	...That seems a little out of the ordinary. I suggest proceeding with caution. Is there a way to bypass this area?	2																					
10	10		301								Liv	Searching... No route was found.	1																					
11	11		301								Liv	I can continue searching, but I'll need time...	1																					
12	12		302								What is Babylonia's current altitude?	13																						
13	13		301								Lee	Retrieving external data... Babylonia is still falling. It's now very close to the bottom of low Earth orbit.	2																					
14	14		302								How bad is the situation?	15																						
15	15		301								Lee	Babylonia isn't designed to navigate through the stratosphere. If the altitude is too low, navigational functions will begin to malfunction...	2																					
16	16		301								Liv	Even if we abandon Babylonia, there won't be enough time to evacuate the whole ship...	1																					
17	17		301								Lee	Disregarding any anti-air weaponry on the surface that can damage Babylonia, the forced landing itself could kill at least a fourth of the passengers.	2																					
18	18		302								...We can't wait any longer.	19																						
19	19		302								We have to stop it from crash landing.	20																						
20	20		302								We need to hurry.	21																						
21	21		301								Lucia	If we force our way through, even though it won't impact us Constructs, it will pose a risk to you, Commandant.	3																					
22	22		301								Lucia	But I also agree that there's no time to waste.	3																					
23	23		301								Lucia	In that case, I'll take point. Lee will cover the rear. Commandant, you'll be safer in the back.	3																					
24	24		302								...	25	Why is that?	25																				
25	25		301								Lucia	Being hit in virtual space won't be fatal, but disconnecting is still excruciating for humans.	3																					
26	26		301								Liv	If a Construct dies... they can still be repaired if the damage isn't beyond the reboot threshold.	1																					
27	27		301								Liv	But... humans can't be rebooted.	1																					
28	28		301								Lucia	So... We can't afford to lose you, Commandant.	3																					
29	29		302								...Alright.	31	Same goes for you.	30																				
30	30		301								Lucia	Yes... We know.	3																					
31	31		301								Lee	I'm ready to provide cover fire.	2
