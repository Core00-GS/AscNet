4	4		301			DialogEnable						"...The wolf's cub was left alone in the depths of the den."																						
5	5		301									"...The disaster was so sudden that it lost its parents' protection. It was so weak that it was abandoned by the pack before it even learned to hunt."																						
6	6		301									"As the frigid Arctic winter approaches, it must learn to hunt on its own if there is any hope for it to survive through the months of darkness."																						
7	7		301									In Cerberus' dark base, familiar voices and music can be heard intermittently coming from deep within. It seems to be a documentary as part of Babylonia's general education.																						
8	8		301									"A small shadow appears on the endless tundra. It's a migrating lemming separated from the group while foraging."																						
9	9		301									"For a lemming, separation from the group is certain death."																						
10	10		301									"But for the wolf cub, it now has a chance of survival."																						
11	11		301									The narrator's voice echoes in the empty room. Following the source of the sound, you see a small figure huddled in front of the bright fluorescent screen.																						
12	12		302								(Over there...?)	13																						
13	13		301									Unable to see clearly in the darkness, you walk in the direction of the faint light from the terminal.																						
14	14		301									"...Step by step, the lemming approaches the seemingly fertile meadow. The white wolf cub huddles behind a nearby stone, awaiting the opportunity to pounce."																						
15	15		301									Walking around a series of messy tables and chairs, you arrive at the source of the sound.																						
16	16		301									It's a small space made of supply crates and tables. An old audio-visual terminal is laying on the ground in the center of the space, playing a popular nature documentary from the Golden Age.																						
17	17		301									Although this is the source of the sound echoing in the room, the figure you had just seen is now gone.																						
18	18		301									You can't help but lower your gaze at the content playing on the audio-visual terminal. Who put it here?																						
19	19		301									"The white wolf waits quietly for the lemming to approach, every muscle ready to pounce."																						
20	20		301									"Hunting is a primal instinct engraved in the wolf's DNA, allowing them to capture their prey with impeccable speed and accuracy."																						
21	21		301									"And, now—"																						
22	22		401							2	1511																							
23	23		301									You heard a light "thud" from behind. A white figure runs by in the dim light.																						
24	24		302								Who's there?!	25	(Draws gun)	25																				
25	25		301									For a moment, you feel the cold gaze of a wild animal staring at you. You turn around and quickly draw your gun—																						
26	26		301									—to see a pair of gray eyes looking at you.																						
27	27		302								No. 21?	28	...	28

29	29		301									The lights in the room turn on.																						
30	30		301								???	Buddy, do not attack.																						
31	31		301									A small female Construct hangs upside from the ceiling, her baggy sleeves swaying. The girl's face hovers in front of you. Her long white hair dangles down, revealing her smooth forehead.																						
32	32		301									Caught off guard, your hand holding the gun freezes midair.																						
33	33		301									Something rubs against your leg... No. 21's inseparable Co-Bot circles around you, bearing its "teeth and claws," ready to attack.																						
34	34		301									No. 21's legs sway gently, and she lands silently in an elegant pose.																						
35	35		201							1	500328	4																						
36	36		301							1	No. 21	You've crossed the boundary.	1																					
37	37		301								No. 21	This is my territory.	1																					
38	38		301									Following her gaze, you lower your head and see a line forcibly scratched into the ground with what appears to be a weapon.																						
39	39		302								...Sorry.	40																						
40	40		301									The "boundary" is an arc on the ground, enclosing the space.																						
41	41		301									You holster your gun and take a few steps to the side, away from the small "nest" made of supply crates.																						
42	42		204							1																								
43	43		301				DialogDisable					As you step further away, No. 21 visibly relaxes.																						
44	44		302								Why were you...	45																						
45	45		302								Hanging from the ceiling?	46																						
46	46		301			DialogEnable					No. 21	Captain said you like to be greeted this way.	1																					
47	47		301								No. 21	So, that's why I greeted you like that.	1																					
48	48		302								...Next time, just say "Hi" like normal.	49																						
49	49		301								No. 21	...Understood.	1																					
50	50		301									No. 21 looks down and records in her terminal, "Gray Raven Commandant Greeting: Normal".																						
51	51		301									"Bzzrt—"																						
52	52		301									The audio-video terminal that you had previously ignored lets out a sharp noise as if wanting attention. The documentary turns into a mosaic of unknown significance, and an intermittent buzz comes from it.																						
53	53		302								Is that...?	54																						
54	54		301								No. 21	I'm using it to "study" information outside of battle.	1																					
55	55		301								No. 21	...But it glitches each time it reaches this point.	1																					
56	56		301									No. 21 picks up the audio-visual terminal, holds it in front of her and shakes it as if trying to repair it with some "percussive maintenance."																						
57	57		301									You don't know if she hit any buttons, but the noise and picture returns to normal.																						
58	58		302								That works?	59																						
59	59		301									No. 21's eyes gleam as she holds the terminal.																						
60	60		301									The video on the terminal seems to continue to play, but—																						
61	61		301									The migrating animals walk backward quickly, and the lemming regurgitates the plants it had just eaten. Even the gentle voice of the narrator becomes a strange, quiet whisper.																						
62	62		302								Uh... Looks like it's rewinding...	63																						
63	63		301								No. 21	...	1																					
64	64		301									No. 21 quietly stares at the screen as if she doesn't notice anything wrong. Right at that moment, an adult white wolf on the screen enthusiastically rescues a fallen deer and sends it back to the herd.																						
65	65		302								...	66																						
66	66		301								No. 21	The white wolf is back home.	1																					
67	67		302								Sorry?	68																						
68	68		301								No. 21	It was all alone, but now it's with its pack.	1																					
69	69		301									No. 21 turns the terminal to face you. The documentary rewinds to before the wolves had abandoned the wolf cub.																						
70	70		301								No. 21	It finally found "home."	1																					
71	71		302								...Indeed.	72	(Remain silent)	72																				
72	72		301									The documentary stops right after the wolf cub is born. The little cub snuggles up beside its mother.																						
73	73		302								Do you like the documentary?	74																						
74	74		301								No. 21	Like?	1																					
75	75		302								You were watching it.	76																						
76	76		301								No. 21	I want to keep watching it. Does that mean I "like" it?	1																					
77	77		302								You could say that.	78	For you, I think so.	78																				
78	78		301								No. 21	All I know is what I "dislike."	1																					
79	79		302								You'll know soon enough.	80																						
80	80		301								No. 21	I see...	1																					
81	81		301									No. 21 mulls over your words, then nods.																						
82	82		301								No. 21	Do you have a new mission here, 【kuroname】?	1																					
83	83		301								No. 21	Captain hasn't issued us any new missions recently.	1																					
84	84		301								No. 21	When we aren't on a mission... I don't know what to do.	1																					
85	85		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Looking at No. 21's inquisitive gaze, Vera's slightly cryptic expression comes to mind.

91	91		301			DialogEnable				1	Vera	Got that right.	1																					
92	92		301								Vera	The higher-ups said that No. 21 has been going haywire in battle recently. She's become a liability. We've been pulled out of duty, so she can be put under observation.	1																					
93	93		301								Vera	There are also rumors going around that she clashed with members from the other teams... And was even getting into fights here in Babylonia.	1																					
94	94		302								That's a misunderstanding!	95	What?! That's not true!	95																				
95	95		301								Vera	Obviously. I'll spare you the REAL tinfoil hat conspiracies, but this is all just in a day's work for us.	1

102	102		301								Vera	Forget it.	1																					
103	103		301								Vera	The point is, people are advocating for No. 21 to be re-evaluated for combat thanks to all this bull****. They're all lining up outside our door.	1																					
104	104		301								Vera	If she's taken away in her current condition... Think it'll just be all rainbows and sunshine?	1																					
105	105		301								Vera	If they decide that she's unfit for battle via remote link, she'll be kicked out of Cerberus.	1																					
106	106		301								Vera	What do you think they do with Constructs that have M.I.N.D. issues and can't be deployed in combat...? As a Chief, I'm sure you get the gist.	1																					
107	107		301								Vera	Rather than let those dimwits decide the fate of my team, it's better to find someone to get this over with ASAP.	1																					
108	108		301								Vera	But I can't do it by myself...	1																					
109	109		301								Vera	So... I want you to help No. 21 run some combat simulations to prove that she won't go haywire anymore.	1																					
110	110		302								Why me?	111	Understood.	114																				
111	111		301								Vera	Are you really that dense, or are you just playing dumb?	1																					
112	112		301								Vera	No. 21 started going nuts ever since you last remote linked with her.	1																					
113	113	117	301								Vera	You got her into this mess. Don't you think you should be the one to get her out of it? Hm, Gray Raven Commandant?	1																					
114	114		301									No. 21 started going haywire after you remotely connected with her.																						
115	115		301									Those memories and emotions from your memory replays might still be affecting No. 21's M.I.N.D.																						
116	116		301								Vera	Seeing as you're so quick to accept, listen up—	1																					
117	117		301								Vera	If you're the reason why I lose such valuable member of my team, I'll cut you to pieces.	1
