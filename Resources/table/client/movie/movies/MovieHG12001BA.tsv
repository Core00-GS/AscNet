5	5		301							1	Hassen	This is an era filled with challenges and uncertainties. There is no way of knowing which path will lead humanity to the future.	1																					
6	6		301									The President's resonating voice echos in everyone's ears.																						
7	7		301								Hassen	The only thing we know is that this path will be paved with hurdles, drenched in blood and sweat, covered in tears and smoke.	1																					
8	8		301								Hassen	It is not a broad, easy road ahead of you all. You might even regret having stepped on it one day.	1																					
9	9		301								Hassen	So you mustn't forget the passion and ambition inside you today. Tattoo it in your heart so that it serves as a reminder in your moments of doubt.	1																					
10	10		301								Hassen	This will be a difficult but magnificent voyage, so remember—humanity's hopes and prayers are with you.	1																					
11	11		301								Hassen	May you will all return home safe.	1

13	13		301									A quick moment of silence fills the air as the President's impassioned speech comes to an end, but it is soon replaced by thunderous applause.																						
14	14		301									The students in the audience begin to stand one by one, all moved by the President's words.																						
15	15		301									As students of the only Command College in Babylonia, they all know the responsibility they will be shouldering. But with no idea of its weight, they have only managed to hear the President's passion, not his pain.																						
16	16		301									Yet to be showered with blood and dust, the eaglets might carry with them a hint of fear of the unknown, but more than anything, they are filled with the excitement and hope of leaving their nest.																						
17	17		301									Victories, titles, glory, applause... each of their hearts is thumping with these ethereal ideas.																						
18	18		301									To destroy the Punishing Virus and reclaim Earth—this idea has been planted in their heads since their first day here. It is as much a goal as it is a cage.																						
19	19		301									Today is the day when a new batch of students graduate from F.O.S. Military Command College, as well as the rare occasion where alumni can return and visit.																						
20	20		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					It is an event so special that even the Babylonia President has come and delivered a speech to encourage all the young fighters who are about to depart for Earth.																						
21	21		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory66.jpg																								
22	22		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						...																						
23	23		301									You stand behind the curtain, quietly observing all the hopeful faces of your "juniors."																						
24	24		301									There seems to be a lump in your throat. The speech you have prepared and remembered is now blurry and faded, like paper soaked in water.																						
25	25		301									There should be another person speaking before you.																						
26	26		301								Host	Thank you, President Hassen, for that beautiful speech. Up next, we have invited some distinguished alumni to share a few words, so let me introduce one of the Chiefs of our college, a remarkable role model...																						
27	27		301									He pauses.																						
28	28		301								Host	【kuroname】.																						
29	29		301									You are stunted by this sudden change of plan.																						
30	30		301									It is now your turn to stand there in the limelight, to face those aspiring, innocent eyes that are untainted by bloodshed.																						
31	31		301									It is now your turn to stand in front of the podium and say those meaningless slogans.																						
32	32		301									The host is still calling your name, but your legs are frozen, incapable of moving.																						
33	33		301									Suddenly, someone taps you on your shoulder.																						
34	34		201							1	500309	1																						
35	35		301							1		You turn around and find a familiar face.																						
36	36		302								Chrome.	37																						
37	37		301									The young Construct stands quietly behind you. His slender figure, confident posture, and pale-blonde hair are all carefully curated and attentively maintained.																						
38	38		301									He looks the way he usually looks, except there is something different that you cannot quite pinpoint.																						
39	39		202							1					1																			
40	40		301									He assuredly adjusts your shirt collar and fixes the tilted medal on your chest.																						
41	41		301									Instead of the slightly unkempt way your clothes were, you now look as graceful and refined as the Construct before you.																						
42	42		201							1	500309	1																						
43	43		301							1	Chrome	They're calling your name, 【kuroname】.	1																					
44	44		301									He seems to see right through what is troubling you.																						
45	45		301								Chrome	Don't let those who look up to you wait. Speak your mind, and that is enough.	1																					
46	46		202							1					1																			
47	47		301									Then he slowly turns you toward the stage before gently nudging you forward.																						
48	48		301									He uses just enough force that you do not trip on the sudden movement while still appearing to walk with intent and strength.																						
49	49		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You simply feel an unwavering presence supporting you as you step out.																						
50	50		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory8.jpg																								
51	51		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You part the curtain and stand before the audience, but you cannot help and turn back.																						
52	52		301									Chrome is still standing in the shadow of the veil. Noticing your gaze, he gently nods.																						
53	53		301									You do not have time to ponder where that loneliness you find on him comes from. You follow the motion and walk toward where the spotlight is.																						
54	54		301				DialogDisable					Standing there, you take a deep breath.																						
55	55		302								Congratulations, graduates...	56																						
56	56		302								This is a day to remember...	57																						
57	57		301			DialogEnable	AniZhuanchangBegin					And you deliver your speech—the way you wrote it, the way you intended.																						
58	58		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						When it is over—																						
59	59		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You look around but fail to find the golden glow of the figure who gave you the support you needed.																						
60	60		401							1	208																							
61	61		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory17.jpg																								
62	62		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						As the ceremony comes to a close, you decide to take a casual stroll around the campus, enjoying the moment of respite, which has become so rare since you graduated.																						
63	63		301									The corridors are empty as the students are all gathered in the hall, talking to the renowned alumni about the fun moments during their tours and the aspirations the students have for their future.																						
64	64		301									You, however, have no interest in that kind of conversation, so you managed to find an opportunity to sneak away.																						
65	65		301									Without realizing it, you have arrived at the door of your old classroom.																						
66	66		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You expect to find it empty as well, much like the corridor outside. Instead, you step through the door and run into a golden-haired figure.																						
67	67		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory146.png																								
68	68		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						...																						
69	69		301									Chrome sits quietly in the middle of the room. Glows from the artificial sky shine through the windows, the golden-red hue casting his silhouette in a gentler light than how you remember the stoic top student.																						
70	70		301									Peaceful and harmonious, like an oil painting.																						
71	71		301									So you hold your breath, lest it disrupts the scene, and you tiptoe your way to the seat in front of him and sit down.																						
72	72		301									Feeling someone else's presence, Chrome opts not to raise his head.																						
73	73		301									You turn around, your arms crossed on top of the back of the chair, and you rest your chin on your hands, staring at Chrome.																						
74	74		301									That is when you notice the hologram projected on the desk before him, its light blue projections forming a chessboard in the air.																						
75	75		301									Noticing your gaze, Chrome finally looks up and stares back.																						
76	76		301									You look at each other, both of you coming to an unstated understanding. Chrome does not question your presence here, and you do not ask why he is here in the first place.																						
77	77		301									Eventually, Chrome breaks the silence.																						
78	78		201							1	500309	1																						
79	79		301							1	Chrome	A game of chess, 【kuroname】?	1																					
80	80		301									You almost feel like his words transported you back to when you were a student.																						
81	81		301									As if the person sitting in front of you is not the captain of Strike Hawk, and you have yet to be the commandant of Gray Raven.																						
82	82		301									Just a student who has arrived early asking another student who has just arrived to join him in a game of chess.																						
83	83		301									You have yet to answer, but Chrome already understands your unspoken "yes."																						
84	84		301									So he raises his hand, his palm out in a gesture of "please."																						
85	85		204							1	1																							
86	86		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Chrome	White goes first. I look forward to your opening, 【kuroname】.	1
