26	26		301								Sophia	■■■■■, I think part of our conversation was blocked. Can you feel it...?	2																					
27	27		301								Lee	Yeah, probably some special setting of the connection chamber... But why does it block our names in particular?	1																					
28	28		302							449	But I can tell who you are. Lee and Sophia.	31	But why redact Lee's and Sophia's names?	31
