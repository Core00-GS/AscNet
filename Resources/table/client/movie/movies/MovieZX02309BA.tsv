4	4		301									Shortly after the main troop has evacuated, the ground quakes and reverberates due to some sort of explosion.																						
5	5		301									After the deafening noises fade away, the world goes quiet for another half a minute before the footsteps of a horde of Hetero-Creatures come from somewhere nearby.																						
6	6		301									They do not seem to notice the people hiding in the basement. Instead, they go straight across the conservation area and head for where the explosion took place.																						
7	7		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The footsteps continue for more than half an hour. Then, a few more loud bangs come from the distance.																						
8	8		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory174.png																								
9	9		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Trapped in the basement, the elders and the boy have no way of knowing what is going on out there. But they notice the Central Purification Filter has started glowing red after the footsteps of those Hetero-Creatures disappeared.																						
10	10		301									No one can tell what the red indicators meant. They only know something has stopped working.																						
11	11		301									Then, the malfunctioning Central Purification Filter starts sending in thick mists of the Punishing Virus instead of breathable air. It is no longer safe to hide underground.																						
12	12		301									The old woman helps Cali return to the surface, but then returns to where they were half an hour later.

15	15		301							1	Old Lady	All I saw out there was the Red Tide. They are like mud scattered everywhere on the surface. Some were even buried in pits.	1																					
16	16		301									She points at her leg. The part of her body below the ankles, covered in Red Tide, has started to fester.																						
17	17		301								Old Lady	The pits are even deeper further out. We're trapped here.	1																					
18	18		301									Distressed, she sighs and sits on a stretcher. She cannot move her attention away from Cali.																						
19	19		301								Old Lady	Old man, try to rest.	1																					
20	20		301								Cali	...Ouch...	2																					
21	21		301								Old Lady	I know. I'm hurting too. I stepped into Red Tide just to find you a path forward. My legs are festering now. I'm afraid my time is coming soon.	1																					
22	22		301								Old Lady	Rest now. When you wake up, the pain will have gone away.	1																					
23	23		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Trembling, Cali nods and lies on the empty stretcher.

27	27		301									It has been 5 hours after the main troop evacuated.																						
28	28		301									Judging by how fast they traveled last time, they have to be well on their way back.																						
29	29		301									At the thought of this, Stanley smiles. He raises his hand to rub Matches' head in an attempt to keep hunger at bay by feeling its soft touch.																						
30	30		301									The old woman sitting not very far away lifts up her pants and reveals a pair of legs that have been completely corroded by the Punishing Virus.																						
31	31		301									Before Liv leaves, she leaves behind two serums and a can from their scarce resources.																						
32	32		301									The three struggle to decide how to distribute these supplies, and eventually give the can to Stanley and let the old couple have the serums.																						
33	33		301									But Stanley doesn't open the can immediately. He plans to save this precious supply until the very last.

41	41		301									It has been 10 hours after the main troop evacuated.																						
42	42		301									Even dressed in the protective suit, Stanley can still feel the open wounds on her legs festering very quickly.																						
43	43		301									He doesn't know where to find a device to assess the concentration of the Punishing Virus. But judging by the purulence coming out of his wounds, he can roughly come up with an estimate.

45	45		201							2	500422		100																					
46	46		301							1	Stanley	How much longer will they take...?	1																					
47	47		301									Judging by their speed last time, they should have returned here by now. But so far, they have heard nothing.																						
48	48		301									"Perhaps they are traveling slower this time because there are more people." Stanley tries to calm himself.																						
49	49		301								Stanley	The people in City 044...	1																					
50	50		301									Before they left on foot, Stanley heard Liv mention the CPF of City 044 also malfunctioned.																						
51	51		301									But he believes Liv and Gray Raven will repair the Central Purification Filter. And he also believes what she said, that by planning "a safety route", they can stay away from the Red Tide.																						
52	52		301									But he is not sure whether he can find such a safety route himself.																						
53	53		301									Is the Punishing Virus in City 044 as dense as it is here?																						
54	54		301									He keeps thinking about these two questions, but so far he can only find a negative answer to them both.																						
55	55		301									Her legs ache as time goes by. He has to rip and pull at the sheet and pillow to distract himself from the pain.																						
56	56		301								Matches	(Whimpers)	2																					
57	57		301									Worried, Matches keeps licking Stanley's hand, which keeps a firm grip on the pillow. This would have brought Stanley peace of mind, but the same trick does not work so well this time.																						
58	58		301									Nevertheless, he tries his best to raise his trembling hand and take Matches into his arms.																						
59	59		301								Stanley	...I'm glad you are okay. How I wish humans were just like animals. You carry the Punishing Virus... but you are not affected by it.	1																					
60	60		301								Stanley	It's okay. I am sure I'll get better. Liv said so herself. She will return.	1																					
61	61		301								Matches	...Woof.	2																					
62	62		301									Tears stream down Stanley's face and drop on Matches' head, but the tears stop rolling down from there. Instead, the dog's fur sucks the tears dry. It is as if the dog stops the pain.																						
63	63		301								Stanley	I will get better...	1																					
64	64		301									He struggles to put a smile on his face, and takes out the pen and paper the other boy gave him.																						
65	65		301								Stanley	If I could realize my wishes...	1																					
66	66		301								Stanley	...I want to... leave this place... and find freedom...	1																					
67	67		301									Knowing it will end up in vain, he dares to dream all the same. In the corner of this paper that "makes wishes come true", he draws a pair of simple wings.																						
68	68		301								Stanley	Take me to the sky... across and beyond the Red Tide...	1																					
69	69		301									Like a drowning person holding onto his life-saving straw, he thickens the lines of that pair of wings.																						
70	70		301								Stanley	Together with my Matches... away from this place... to somewhere we belong...	1																					
71	71		202							1	2				1																			
72	72		301									However, tormented by hunger, agony, and the Punishing Virus, he struggles to see the wings clearly no matter how hard he thickens those lines.																						
73	73		301									In a trance, Stanley notices a series of crimson pearls drop on the pair of wings and blossom like a flower of despair.																						
74	74		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					It's blood.

77	77		301									After nightfall, the surface, now painted in red, is as dark and silent as the basement.																						
78	78		301									After 15 hours of waiting, there is still no news bringing hope from outside the gate of this conservation area.																						
79	79		301									Cali awakes several hours later in a daze. He approaches his partner and taps on her shoulder, but realizes she is as cold as ice.																						
80	80		201							1	500294																							
81	81		301							1	Cali	...Lina...	1																					
82	82		301									He struggles to pronounce her name, but this ice-cold body will no longer respond to his call.																						
83	83		301								Cali	...	1																					
84	84		301									Time is always one step ahead. He couldn't even say goodbye before she went gently into that good night.																						
85	85		301									In the dim light, the old man caresses her wrinkled skin and the festering wounds as if he is combing back through his memories and trying to recall the Lina he remembers.																						
86	86		301									They spent a long time together. Illness and aging took away many of his memories, but the remaining ones are all whispering the same name.																						
87	87		301								Cali	...Lina... Lina...	1																					
88	88		301									With tears in his eyes, he looks at the woman named Lina and holds her cold hands with his rough ones before leaning against her.																						
89	89		301								Cali	Wait for me... We'll go back home together...	1																					
90	90		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Hunger, cancer, infection, aging... With these as his tickets to heaven, he will surely follow in her wife's footsteps very soon.

94	94		301									The cozy breeze travels across this land ravaged by disasters as the light of dawn shines.																						
95	95		301									But this beautiful view does not bode well for the boy who suffers from his festering wounds. The only thing keeping the pain at bay for him is the night when he is asleep.																						
96	96		301									It has been 24 hours since the main troop evacuated. The hopeless people waiting in this basement still receive no news from the outside world.

101	101		301									For the next few hours, he tries to fall asleep again many times, but time and time again he is awakened by pain or hunger.																						
102	102		301									He struggles to get out of bed, but realizes he is too weak to do so.																						
103	103		301								Stanley	...	1																					
104	104		301								Stanley	Many people left with them... It would be bad... if anything happened to them...	1																					
105	105		301								Stanley	But I... I think I'm okay with that... After all... I never enjoy living...	1

117	117		301							1		In a trance, he recalls what Liv once asked him. But the memory is soaked in a sea of nothingness and hard to recollect.																						
118	118		301									He only remembers that, before this ever-lasting, desperate night arrived, he thought he was not afraid of illness or death because of the pain he had suffered.																						
119	119		301								Stanley	...What did I say?	1																					
120	120		301									Struggling to recollect the fragmented pieces of his memories, the boy curbs his body, fighting hard to resist the insurmountable pain. The festering wounds torment both his body and his soul.																						
121	121		202							1	2				1																			
122	122		301									...If life is so painful, he might as well embrace death...																						
123	123		301									But what if he could break free from the suffering and live somewhere peacefully without pain?

129	129		301							1	Matches	Woof!	2																					
130	130		301									When all hope is lost, Stanley hears a sound coming from the gate of this basement. It seems someone is approaching.																						
131	131		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Stanley	...They're back!	1																					
132	132		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory458.jpg																								
133	133		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After hours of waiting, this glimpse of hope is like the injection of adrenaline, giving him enough power to fight off the physical pain and fatigue and struggle to stand up. Excited and happy, he staggers to find the old couple sleeping next door.																						
134	134		301								Stanley	...Cali... They are back!	1																					
135	135		301								Stanley	Cali...?	1																					
136	136		201							2	500423		100																					
137	137		301							1	Matches	(Whimpers)	2																					
138	138		301									Stanley notices the old couple not moving. Confused, he takes two steps forward and tries to tap on his shoulder, but realizes his face is pale white.																						
139	139		301								Stanley	...	1																					
140	140		301									He tries to resuscitate them, just like how an adult would do, but realizes their bodies have long grown cold and stiff.																						
141	141		301									He slightly lifts up their clothes and sees their skins have turned into the festered Red Tide.																						
142	142		301									...Just like the wounds on his body.																						
143	143		301								Stanley	Matches... Even they are...	1																					
144	144		301								Matches	...	2																					
145	145		301								Stanley	It's okay. Even if we are the only ones left... we will make it out of this place...	1																					
146	146		301									His clothes are stuck to his sticky, coagulated purulence and blood. The slightest pull at the clothes brings him indescribable pain.																						
147	147		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					But to find hope that lies beyond the sealed gate, he holds his cane firmly and heads for the outside world.																						
148	148		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory287.png																								
149	149		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						With a deep, loud noise, the sealed gate opens.																						
150	150		301									The morning breeze carries a stench that floods the basement, heralding how he will find no salvation in the outside world.																						
151	151		301									What was the sound that he heard? And where did it come from? Was it the wind and ruins making the noises, or was his mind playing tricks on him?																						
152	152		301								Stanley	Where are you?!	1																					
153	153		301									Mustering all his strength, he cries. The shout echoes through the wasteland of this conservation area. Eventually, only wind answers his call.																						
154	154		301								Stanley	...It must still be near, right?	1																					
155	155		301								Stanley	The others are not back yet, but it just might be a Scavenger who accidentally trespassed this area...	1																					
156	156		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The boy does not want to give up hope. He takes a step forward and leaves the people sleeping forever in that basement as he starts climbing and searching.

159	159		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						10:00 a.m.																						
160	160		301									He leaves the basement and searches the entire conservation area. But even now that he has reached the top of this building, there is not a single soul in sight.																						
161	161		301									It has been 28 hours since the main troop left.

165	165		301								Stanley	Everyone is dead.	1																					
166	166		301									Having lost all hope, he lies prone on the top of this building and looks down at its central courtyard below. He wants to cry, but there are no tears left to be shed.																						
167	167		301								Stanley	...Take me away from this place, please...	1																					
168	168		301									To search in this building that isn't very spacious, he has spent 4 hours moving around. With every step he takes, the wounds pain him. He has run out of stamina. There is no way he can return the way he came.																						
169	169		301									For more than a month, he and Matches have never had a proper meal. It is not just him. Even Matches has run out of strength and lies flat on the floor.																						
170	170		301									To most Scavengers, 28 hours is nothing but time that passes in the twinkling of an eye. It was like that to Stanley once.																						
171	171		301									But having been tormented by a month of hunger and illness, 24 hours of suffering and 4 hours of seeking are enough to nearly kill him.																						
172	172		301									The boy is on the verge of death. Silent, he looks at the can in his hand. That is his hope.																						
173	173		301								Stanley	Will things start getting better if Matches and I eat this now?	1																					
174	174		301									The answer to that is no.																						
175	175		301									A half-full can will not bring back strength or heal wounds. The fact will not change: he is trapped on the top of a building in the conservation area, and there is no way he can walk all the way back.																						
176	176		301									Before long, he will be affected by the Punishing Virus. His body will fester and he will meet his end here.																						
177	177		301									To him, eating is pointless now. He might as well save it for another creature that needs it more.																						
178	178		301									The boy has made up his mind. He opens the can and places it in front of Matches.																						
179	179		301								Stanley	Come... You can have it.	1																					
180	180		301									Watching as Matches chows down the food, he finds a smile on his face.																						
181	181		301									"Why am I still smiling?" He thinks to himself. Is it because the situation has improved? Of course not. This boy is smiling... because he sees Matches happy.																						
182	182		301									That alone brings peace to his mind.																						
183	183		301								Stanley	Sorry... I couldn't find any supplies to feed you sooner...	1																					
184	184		301									He looks up to the sky through that pair of wings he drew on the paper. Some memories previously blurred to him are becoming clearer.																						
185	185		301									"I need Matches by my side. He's the only thing keeping me going."																						
186	186		301									"If I ever run out of supplies, I'll abandon myself—not Matches."																						
187	187		301								Stanley	...	1																					
188	188		301								Stanley	...I remember now. I remember what I told Liv...	1																					
189	189		301									Putting the paper back into his pocket, he grasps the delusional fantasy.																						
190	190		301								Stanley	...Matches... I'm happy I still have a can left for you.	1																					
191	191		301								Stanley	...So...	1																					
192	192		301									He has no regrets.																						
193	193		301									In his mind, the boy, nearing his death, grows a pair of wings on his back.																						
194	194		301								Stanley	I'm leaving this place to soar in the sky.	1																					
195	195		301								Matches	Woof!	2																					
196	196		301								Stanley	Sorry, I cannot take you with me... Will you hate me for that?	1

198	198		301							1	Matches	...	2																					
199	199		301								Stanley	If you don't answer me, I'll take that as a no. Forgive me.	1																					
200	200		301								Stanley	...I'm sorry.	1																					
201	201		301									He struggles to stand up and slowly moves closer to the edge of the building.																						
202	202		301								Stanley	...Do you think... they are ever coming back?	1																					
203	203		301								Matches	...	2																					
204	204		301								Stanley	I hope they do. But at the same time, I fear they might run into the Red Tide that surrounds this conservation area.	1																					
205	205		301									With his every movement, those festering wounds being pulled and torn bring insufferable pain, but he doesn't stop.																						
206	206		201							2	500422																							
207	207		301							1	Matches	Woof!	2

229	229		301									He spreads the wings in his mind and, like a bird longing for freedom, he embraces the sky and looks up to chase the sunlight.																						
230	230		301								Stanley	I'm sorry... See you in the next life...																						
231	231		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The boy jumps off the building.

235	235		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						...But as expected, a pair of spiritual wings cannot take flight.																						
236	236		301									The boy quickly falls to the ground and hits a pile of empty boxes.																						
237	237		301									If it was in a scripted story, his pain would have stopped right then and there. But reality doesn't have such mercy on him.																						
238	238		301									The pieces of scraps in those boxes have delayed his death. Grim Reaper didn't come to collect his soul and take away his pain as quickly as he thought.																						
239	239		301									He tries to move his body, but he is no longer in control. Now, all he can do is wait and see how things unfold.																						
240	240		301									The first thing he notices is the sound of flowing liquid.																						
241	241		301									Unlike the sound of raindrops falling on the ground or water streaming out of a tube, this is more like when you break a bottle and the milk inside starts leaking out. Though there isn't much difference, he can still tell the liquid is thicker than water. It is most likely his blood.																						
242	242		301									Later on, numbness and pain start seeping through his limbs and eating away his consciousness. When the feeling of pain fills his limbs, Stanley finally realizes he no longer has enough strength to shout.																						
243	243		301									Death... has never been just a number or name on a list of victims. It is a body that carries the weight of both the past and future, experiencing unimaginable pain as the mind gets ground to dust.																						
244	244		301									The agony of fractured limbs becomes almost eternal. Each drop of blood takes years to fall onto the ground.																						
245	245		301								Stanley	...It... hurts...

250	250		301									His voice is muffled by the blood as it turns into bubbling noises.																						
251	251		301									His heart is ravaged by pain. Had he known this would be so tormenting, would he still choose to take his own life this way?																						
252	252		301									Death has never been easy. It is not a simpler way out.																						
253	253		301								Stanley	Do I... regret this...?																						
254	254		301									Before this day, he had witnessed many people's death.																						
255	255		301									Many refugees would tell themselves, "The worst that can happen is death."																						
256	256		301									He remembers, when he passed by the conservation area, a conservation worker wearing glasses mentioned a term: Sustained Suicide Fantasy.																						
257	257		301									He said the thought might look pessimistic and negative, but it could help people find a way "out," and in that process, also find a little bit of courage to carry on.																						
258	258		301									Except that it isn't really a way "out." Once you step into it, things become a downward spiral.																						
259	259		301									The boy is being tormented by extreme pain that continues to attack his mind and soul. His throat cannot shout, so instead, his heart bleeds and wails and screams for him.																						
260	260		301									As it happens, a question to himself becomes clearer.																						
261	261		301									...Will death really free me?

265	265		301								Stanley	...No...																						
266	266		301									An old man once told him that freedom was the ability to run free even when you were burdened with shackles.																						
267	267		301									If a man gives up life to chase freedom, he is but a slave of his desire, forced to give up on himself.																						
268	268		301									Every inch of his body is in pain and protesting his foolish decision. The agony is pulling at his mind, begging him to stand up and save himself.																						
269	269		301									...So, did all this happen because he made a wrong choice?																						
270	270		301								Stanley	...No...																						
271	271		301									He struggles and utters the same answer he had given to so many questions.																						
272	272		301									From the very beginning, he thought about the possibility. The main troop might not return.																						
273	273		301									But even so, Stanley doesn't regret giving another person a chance to evacuate.																						
274	274		301								Stanley	My regret is that...																						
275	275		301									Since he was born, he has suffered much pain and failed many people. All of it makes an idea very clear.																						
276	276		301									If he had a choice, he didn't wish to be born into this world.																						
277	277		301									This regret planted a seed in his mind that has been growing ever since, which is why he has always put others before himself.																						
278	278		301									But no matter how much he regrets this life, he cannot deny his existence. So, this child who resents and despises life so much, knowing death isn't a way out and that there is a heavy price to pay, has no choice but to face his tragic ending all the same.																						
279	279		301									"People who have not experienced love will spend their lives looking for substitutes."																						
280	280		301									This child, abandoned time and time again, has always wanted to prove somehow that he doesn't always have to be left behind.																						
281	281		301									Now that he has felt the pain and loneliness of pain, he finally understands the value of life. And he is more certain than ever that he has no regrets.																						
282	282		301								Stanley	...This is all I ever wish for...																						
283	283		301									Suffering the pain that is tearing him apart, the boy finds his answer and starts praying.																						
284	284		301									And when all the blood has escaped, the body becomes frozen in time.																						
285	285		301								Stanley	...
