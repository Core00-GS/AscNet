3	3		301			DialogEnable						On the desert wasteland, jagged rock formations jut out of the ground through which the Red Tide flows.																						
4	4		301									Wanshi squats on a towering rock formation.																						
5	5		301									The Red Tide quietly trickles below.																						
6	6		301									Although the tide here occasionally swells, it's not an unstoppable force like previous accounts in the city ruins.																						
7	7		301									Occasionally, he sees strange debris, rusty metal, shredded rubber, and even pale animal bones floating in the red ichor.																						
8	8		301									There doesn't seem to be any fear in Wanshi. He just lets out a big yawn instead.																						
9	9		201							1	500273	8																						
10	10		301							1	Wanshi	Ugh...	1																					
11	11		204							1																								
12	12		301								Wanshi	How much longer do I gotta wait?	1																					
13	13		301									On the rugged surface of the rock, there is not a flat enough space to place the tripod for his sniper rifle.																						
14	14		301								Wanshi	Well—the latest information should have been uploaded to Babylonia. What's taking them so long?	1																					
15	15		301								Wanshi	I don't know what's going on with the Captain either.	1																					
16	16		301								Wanshi	I'm always left to do all the recon work here. Now I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place...	1																					
17	17		301								Wanshi	If they don't dispatch any reinforcements, this place is gonna...	1																					
18	18		202							1					1																			
19	19		301									The Red Tide tributary had only just reached this place twenty-four hours ago.																						
20	20		301									But now, aside from only the tallest of rocks, the entire area has been completely flooded.																						
21	21		301									Fortunately, the Red Tide is only quietly flowing and not surging out of control. The rock on which he stands still towers high above. The Inver-Device and protective equipment strengthened by the Support Force on such short notice enable him to make observations from a relatively safe distance without fear of corruption.																						
22	22		301									However, this cannot continue much longer. It was only a sparse Red Tide tributary not long ago. Now it has completely inundated the area. Even if he proceeds with caution, he is better off leaving this area sooner rather than later.																						
23	23		301									Not only is the Punishing Virus concentration rising, the Red Tide also brings "life"—life to the Punishing Virus.																						
24	24		301									The Red Tide surging below the rock is a breeding ground for Hetero-Creatures.																						
25	25		301									Large red crystal clusters, like reeds and shrubs, surround the trickling tide. Red creatures of various shapes and sizes pass between them.																						
26	26		301									These creatures are neither corrupted machines nor Constructs.																						
27	27		301									These Hetero-Creatures glowing with a red aura are merely vestiges of life on Earth that had been devoured by the Red Tide.																						
28	28		301									On the "riverbank," Wanshi catches a glimpse of a motionless stone suddenly crack as four limbs protrude from within.																						
29	29		301									Wanshi's bionic skin quickly calculates the current wind speed.																						
30	30		201							1	500273	4																						
31	31		301							1	Wanshi	1.6 meters per second. Wind blowing from 4 o'clock.	1																					
32	32		301								Wanshi	My sniper scope should move a notch right to compensate for the wind.	1																					
33	33		202							1																								
34	34		301									Slightly leaning to the side, the crosshairs in the narrow scope moves one mil to the right.																						
35	35		301									Ready. Aim. Fire... Bullseye.																						
36	36		401							2	1510																							
37	37		301									The bullet releases from the chamber, landing a direct hit on the Hetero-Creature.																						
38	38		301									The Hetero-Creature collapses onto the ground, writhes in pain, then becomes limp and lifeless. Soon after, the overflowing Red Tide reclaims it into nutrients for the Hetero-Creatures to spawn from within.																						
39	39		201							1	500273																							
40	40		301							1	Wanshi	Yawn... There's no end to them...	1																					
41	41		301									Setting down his sniper rifle, Wanshi takes out his rangefinder binoculars and looks in the direction of the extending tributary.																						
42	42		204							1	8																							
43	43		301								Wanshi	This rock is about 20 meters in height. Without obstacles and regardless of meteorological conditions, the maximum distance that can be visually measured should be...	1																					
44	44		301									Wanshi closes his eyes for a brief second before arriving at a conclusion.																						
45	45		204							1																								
46	46		301								Wanshi	17 km.	1																					
47	47		301									However, the rangefinder can no longer see the end of the tributary.																						
48	48		301									In other words, the Red Tide tributary currently flowing below is extending at a speed of more than 17 kilometers a day.																						
49	49		301								Wanshi	...Looks like this is no laughing matter.	1																					
50	50		202							1					1																			
51	51		301									He puts away the rangefinder, then stands up.																						
52	54		301									Suddenly, the deafening roar of motors rumbles in the sky above.																						
53	55		204							1	7																							
54	56		301									Wanshi quickly looks up. His drowsy eyes suddenly open wide.																						
55	57		301								Wanshi	Huh... I don't believe it.	1
