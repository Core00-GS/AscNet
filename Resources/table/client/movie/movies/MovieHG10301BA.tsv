5	5		302								Let's return to the base to deal with the other affairs.	6	We could keep going to collect more materials.	7																				
6	6	8	301								Liv	You can leave the work at the base to me, Commandant.	1																					
7	7		301								Liv	We can leave collecting materials to the other Constructs. I don't think you have to do it yourself, Commandant.	1																					
8	8		301								Liv	Not to mention, it's break time already.	1																					
9	9		301								Liv	Although the sun's not setting anytime soon in the current season, you should still disconnect early to unwind in preparation for a good night's sleep.	1																					
10	10		302								I'm still very energized.	11	It's uncomfortable for me to leave work unfinished.	12

12	12		301								Liv	That feeling of uneasiness is an early sign of neurotic disorder, Commandant.	1																					
13	13		301								Liv	Commandant, I've been monitoring your connection and biological data, and it's always the most unstable at this time of day.	1																					
14	14		301								Liv	You must have proper rests to properly command us on the battlefield.	1																					
15	15		301								Liv	So how about we disconnect now and take a break, okay?	1																					
16	16		302								(Liv gives off an aura that prohibits you from saying no.)	17	U-understood.	18																				
17	17	19	301								Liv	I'll take your silence as an affirmative.	1																					
18	18		301								Liv	I'm glad you understand.	1																					
19	19		301								Liv	I'll be preparing for tomorrow's connection at the base, then.	1																					
20	20		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	I'll see you tomorrow, Commandant.	1
