5	5		301									Even though we needed to find Liv as soon as possible, maintenance and preparation must never be treated with a light heart.

7	6		301							1	Lucia	Our equipment has durability. Spending a little more time now may save us big troubles in future battles.	1

9	7		301							1	Kamui	True. Okay, I'll check our status. Is anyone poisoned?	1																					
10	8		301								Kamui	Commandant, are you?	1																					
11	3003		302								Why don't you just check the menu?	9	I don't think so.	10																				
12	9	1003	301								Kamui	Oh, right!	1																					
13	10	1001	301								Kamui	No...? What about the antidotes I collected?	1

16	11	12	301							1	Lee	Are you that disappointed that Commandant isn't poisoned? You could have used the menu to check our status in the first place!	2																					
17	12	1003	301								Kamui	Menu, right! I almost forget!	1																					
18	1003		202							1	2																							
19	13		301									Kamui immediately opened his menu and navigated to the team page.																						
20	3004		201							1	1081001																							
21	14		301							1	Kamui	Hmm... Everybody's looking pretty good. Liv doesn't seem to be injured, although we still don't know where she is.	1																					
22	15		301									Lucia often used this menu to check Liv's condition and determine where the team was heading next.																						
23	16		301							1	Kamui	Oh, there's one thing...	1																					
24	3005		302								What's wrong?	17	Is anyone hurt?	18																				
25	17	3006	301								Kamui	I just realized Karenina wasn't in our team.	1																					
26	18	3006	301								Kamui	No, but I just realized Karenina wasn't in our team.	1

29	19		301							1	Karenina	Huh? Does it matter?	2																					
30	20		301								Kamui	But we are moving together as teammates. Isn't it strange if you are not displayed in our team?	1																					
31	21		301								Karenina	Not at all. I'm not 【kuroname】. Don't take me as your teammate just because we are moving together!	2																					
32	3008		201							1	500173		400																					
33	22		301							1	Lee	But just like how we guessed Liv's condition, Vera or Camu may be able to locate you from their menu.	1																					
34	23		301								Karenina	Are you suggesting I am a liability?	2																					
35	24		301								Lee	I'm only talking from a safety perspective. You aren't going back either, are you?	1																					
36	25		301								Karenina	That doesn't mean I'm going to join you. The reason I played this game was to win over Lucia...	2																					
37	3070		201							1	500166	1	400																					
38	26		301							1	Lucia	When the time comes, you can just leave the team. You have your own plans, right? That's why you didn't go back but chose to move with us.	1																					
39	27		301								Karenina	Tsk...	2

42	28		301							1	Kamui	Commandant, help us! Let Karenina stay.	1																					
43	3011		302								I want Karenina to be my teammate!	2001	Just do us a favor, will you?	2002

47	30	31	301							1	Karenina	Um...	1																					
48	31		301									Karenina was struggling. Ever since she knew that players could jump to other teams, she had been staring at her own team menu.																						
49	32		301									Everybody knew what she was thinking.																						
50	33		301								Karenina	Hmph! It's only temporary! Temporary, remember!	1																					
51	34		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Karenina joined the team.
