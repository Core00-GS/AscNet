3	3		301			DialogEnable						In this light gold room with a lofty roof, bookshelves line both sides with various data panels and texts in chronological order. The half-suspended display monitor shows the current position of its occupants.																						
4	4		301									Flags of previous Kowloong dynasties hang on the wall at the end of the bookshelf. Some have faded with time. Others that show burns from the flames of war hang from the top of the dome.																						
5	5		301									This is the archives of the Kowloong Chamber of Commerce. It is a symbol of history and glory. It stands in the corner of the KCC as a witness to the footprints of humanity's ancestors.

7	7		301							1	Villier	What exactly do we want from this data?	1																					
8	8		203							1	0.25	-400																						
9	9		201							2	500220		400																					
10	10		301							1	Qu	To understand history. To reflect over history.	2																					
11	11		301								Villier	Is this history? All I see is historians eulogizing the victors and denouncing the losers.	1																					
12	12		301								Villier	You saw the battle during the merging of the KCC, right? Our ancestors were praised as those who sought justice, while members of the opposition were labeled as stubborn conservatives of a bygone era.	1																					
13	13		301								Villier	Why? Because history is written by the victors. So the losers are always wrong.	1																					
14	14		301								Villier	Kowloong disintegrated their society, wiped out their history, and imposed what Kowloong thought of as truth on those uncivilized humans.	1																					
15	15		301								Villier	Pff, anyone with half a brain can see the error in their ways.	1																					
16	16		301								Qu	However, the efforts of the winners have been recorded in the annals of history. It is an indisputable fact that they were finally able to unify Kowloong, making it more stable.	2																					
17	17		301								Villier	Isn't this just consequentialism?	1																					
18	18		301								Villier	Look here.	1																					
19	19		202							1	2				1																			
20	20		301									Villier says, gently swiping his data panel to transfer a large quantity of encrypted data onto Qu's data panel.																						
21	21		201							1	500215		-400																					
22	22		201							2	500220		400																					
23	23		301							1	Qu	What are these?	2																					
24	24		301								Villier	I checked the global data records.	1																					
25	25		301								Qu	Looks like there's some discrepancy with what was recorded in historical texts.	2																					
26	26		301								Villier	Indeed. This man was labeled as a "sinner" for destroying Kowloong and causing countless deaths during a natural disaster that ravaged Kowloong years ago.	1																					
27	27		301								Qu	A natural disaster shouldn't have caused such destruction. It was the Golden Age, after all.	2																					
28	28		301								Villier	Well, in reality, he sacrificed his life to stop the proliferation of destruction.	1																					
29	29		301								Villier	Humans don't care about the truth. They only want a target to project their anger and resentment. That way, they can play the victim.	1																					
30	30		301								Villier	Most people choose the path of least resistance.	1																					
31	31		301								Villier	The few who remember cracked under years of pressure. Unsteady alliances dissolve. As for the truth, it is long buried under the comforts of society. Seeking gain and avoiding loss‚Äîthat is human nature.	1																					
32	32		301								Qu	Faced with this fact, he still chose to sacrifice himself.	2																					
33	33		301								Villier	Therefore, he is foolish for not thinking rationally. Had he mobilized public relations and enacted tougher measure to win the support of others, it could've been a different story.	1																					
34	34		301								Villier	...When can humanity be perfect like machines?	1																					
35	35		301								Villier	Winners, losers‚Äîthey all only know to fight for whatever they believe in.	1																					
36	36		301								Villier	What an arrogant and ignorant existence.	1																					
37	37		301								Qu	Is that so?	2																					
38	38		301								Villier	That's all I see from this pile of data. It's hideous.	1																					
39	39		301								Qu	If they were given a second chance, do you think they would make the same choices?	2																					
40	40		301								Villier	I think so. Humanity doesn't understand how to correct their course. Otherwise, history wouldn't be doomed to repeat itself.	1																					
41	41		301								Qu	What if it were you?	2																					
42	42		301								Villier	...	1																					
43	43		202							1	2				1																			
44	44		301									Hearing this, Villier is at a momentary loss for words before smiling bitterly.																						
45	45		201							1	500215																							
46	46		301							1	Villier	I don't want to admit it, but I'd stick firmly to my beliefs. Sometimes, my similarities with humanity sickens me.	1																					
47	47		202							1					1																			
48	48		301									Villier shakes his head and walks to the end of the archives. Qu keeps searching through the data in front of her.																						
49	49		201							1	500220																							
50	50		301							1	Qu	Really...?	1																					
51	51		202							1					1																			
52	52		301									Qu stares at the holographic image before her of the Pulao Crew returning victoriously. He is laughing and patting a comrade on the shoulder.																						
53	53		201							1	500220																							
54	54		301							1	Qu	This looks... pleasant.	1																					
55	55		202							1					1																			
56	56		301									The next picture is of a medic kneeling beside a wounded soldier. She puts the injured man's hand on her forehead as she weeps. The soldier's abdomen is splayed open. He clearly does not have much time left.																						
57	57		201							1	500220																							
58	58		301							1	Qu	This picture is... sorrowful.	1																					
59	59		202							1					1																			
60	60		301									Qu's hand stops on the last picture, which is of a Baxia soldier smiling as he walks toward a burn pile.	1																					
61	61		201							1	500220																							
62	62		301							1	Qu	Trying even if you know you're wrong. Fighting even if you're doomed to fail.	1																					
63	63		301								Qu	Is this humanity?	1																					
64	64		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	I don't understand...	1

66	66		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory177.png																								
67	67		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Guard	Lord Yin, you made it.																						
68	500		201							1	500217																							
69	68		301								Yin	Indeed. Those two are still inside?	1																					
70	69		301								Guard	Correct. The family has arranged for them to stay here until after the history exam next week.																						
71	70		301								Guard	I'm afraid the exam is merely just a formality. Here's the video from the previous exam.																						
72	71		301									The bodyguard hands a control panel to Yin, which displays Qu and Villier methodically answering each of the questions posed by the Suanni scholars.																						
73	72		301									After the test, the Suanni scholars leave the archives and happily praise Qu and Villier.																						
74	73		301								Senior Official	Lord Yin, we can't keep this up much longer.																						
75	74		301								Junior Official	Yes, of course. More members of the Kowloong Crew support them. When the election comes around, I'm afraid...																						
76	75		301									Before the official could finish speaking, Yin puts his hand to the man's head in the shape of a pistol.																						
77	76		301								Yin	Shh... Do you hear that?	1																					
78	77		301								Junior Official	W-what?																						
79	78		301								Yin	The Ode of Time.	1																					
80	79		301								Yin	As time goes on, Kowloong continues to expand. Generations of dynasties come and go.	1																					
81	80		301								Yin	There are miracles and disasters, redemption and tyranny, inspirational history and tormenting lament.	1																					
82	81		301									Yin speaks as he walks toward the official. The official gradually steps back until he reaches the corridor wall with nowhere to retreat.																						
83	82		301								Yin	These are all watershed moments in the river of time.	1																					
84	83		301								Yin	Predecessors will eventually become lost to history and be trampled by generations to come. Is that what you were trying to say?	1																					
85	84		301								Junior Official	No, no, no. My humblest apologies, I misspoke. I beg your forgiveness.																						
86	85		301								Yin	(Chuckles) Our family taught us that history is inevitable.	1																					
87	86		301								Yin	But the family has some unspoken agreements.	1																					
88	1000		204							1	5																							
89	87		301								Yin	You do not need to give up what you possess so easily.	1																					
90	1001		204							1																								
91	88		301									Yin lowers his hand and smiles as he pats the official's cheek. The official cannot help but tremble in fear.																						
92	89		301								Yin	Heh, lucky you. I'm not carrying a weapon today.	1																					
93	90		301									Yin turns to leave after speaking, and the official finally breathes a sigh of relief, then collapses against the wall.																						
94	91		301									But just then, Yin sticks out his left hand in the shape of a gun and points it at the official. He mouths‚Äî																						
95	1002		204							1	13																							
96	92		301								Yin	Bang!	1																					
97	93		301									A bullet penetrates the official's skull and splatters blood and brain matter all over the relief on the corridor wall.																						
98	1003		204							1		5																						
99	94		301									The guard holsters his silenced pistol and pulls out cleaning supplies to clear the scene.																						
100	95		301									The senior official bows his head in silence and follows behind Yin.																						
101	96		301									Yin looks at the closed door to the archives, sneers coldly, then turns away.																						
102	97		301								Yin	Those two monsters...	1																					
103	98		301								Yin	Hmph. Don't restrain ourselves and use whatever means necessary. Isn't that what we were taught?	1																					
104	99		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Senior Official	U-understood.
