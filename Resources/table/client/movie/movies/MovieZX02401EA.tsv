5	5		301									Your thoughts drift away. And your body feels heavier than ever.																						
6	6		301									You twist and grasp at the air like a dragon struggling to break free from invisible shackles. The bellow, the shriek, and the melody of madness slowly lose their order as the sound of the pipe fades away like a weary man desperately carrying a broken tune. It is the last cry of his hoarse whisper.

13	13		301									Sticky blood drips on the sand and quickly gets absorbed. As sanity fades away, the life force is also slowly drained.																						
14	14		301									The dragon claws are cold and sharp. You feel like you are nothing but a chunk of meat in the shape of a human or merely a skeleton, pegged down in the name of agony and unable to break free.																						
15	15		301									Agony and relief are like twins in a womb. Fantasy and reality are intertwined and mixed together.																						
16	16		301									When have you speculated about this sort of boundless pain before? Have you ever felt something similar before?

29	29		301									The lingering sound of pipe and the mysterious sorcery manipulate the dragon, bringing calamity and death to this world.																						
30	30		301									Can this be the revenge of that girl, or is this the consequence of another person's sins?																						
31	31		301									Mustering your last bit of strength, you struggle to turn your head slightly in the direction where the sound of the pipe is coming from.																						
32	32		301									Your vision starts to blur.																						
33	33		301									The girl playing with the pipe and the disintegrated figure slowly become one.																						
34	34		301									Is this a fantasy? Are you running away from the ugly truth?																						
35	35		301									In the distance, the girl looks slightly nervous and tense. She keeps a firm grip on her pipe, her bangs hanging down and covering her face as she stands alone like a desert island.																						
36	36		301									Surrounded by endless silence and sadness, this desert island is anything but lively and relieved, the complete opposite of what you thought it would be.																						
37	37		301									All senses have become blurred and unresponsive. Memories grow dull and vague. You can hear faint whispers in your ears.																						
38	38		301									I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...

56	56		301									You feel like you are drowning. Your organs are soaked and immersed in water, swelling and aching. Dizzy and disoriented, you feel as if you just woke up from a dream, unable to tell where it begins or ends. Your instinct is driving you to inhale deeply.																						
57	57		301									It is almost like even the smell in the air has changed. This overwhelming disappointment still pulls at the heartstrings.																						
58	58		301									It is as if the soul returns to the body in the blink of an eye. The visual red quickly fades away. And the heart starts pounding again.

72	72		301									After you were done with the missions on the surface, you immediately got in touch with Ayla and told her everything you knew about Selena.																						
73	73		301									After that, Ayla asked the Parliament for permission to investigate the surface several times, but all her requests were declined due to various reasons. Things were complicated on the surface.

77	77		301									After the operation, the Construct troops responsible for searching the surface quickly hop in and start helping with the other work. They will scan and record every scene, recycle the samples they collect, and bring those samples back to Babylonia for analysis.																						
78	78		301								Allen	If there is any clue about Selena...	1																					
79	79		301									Upon mentioning that name, Allen pauses for a while. That name belongs to a well-renowned artist. Every WGAA member knows her.

93	93		201							1	500110	4																						
94	94		301							1	Ayla	What you just experienced is called a "theater play."	1																					
95	95		301									Ayla relaxes her arms and straightens her back. Then, you notice Ayla is holding a small holographic connection device in her hand. It looks like some sort of an exquisite crown that is more like a retro cosmetic item or a symbol of high socioeconomic status rather than a technology product.																						
96	96		301								Ayla	It seems this immersive holographic theater play technology can still use some improvement in terms of its user experience.	1																					
97	97		302								This side effect is much worse than that of a remote connection.	98	It needs improvement.	101	You don't seem well, Ayla.	102																		
98	98		301								Ayla	I think the nature of this technology is similar to that of a remote connection as they both allow a commandant to synchronize with a Construct.	1																					
99	99		301								Ayla	The theater play experience is, in fact, another type of emotional connection that allows more people to connect together. Connections no longer exist only among characters. The audience and creators can become part of it as well.	1																					
100	100	103	301								Ayla	I think Selena told me about that second half.	1																					
101	101	103	301								Ayla	Now that I think about it, perhaps that is what the experience is meant to be. You see, you were immersed in it.	1																					
102	102		301								Ayla	Is that the insight of a commandant?	1																					
103	103		204							1																								
104	104		301									You see that familiar, impish grin on Ayla's face again, but her eyes are dead serious.																						
105	105		301									Even when you are not on a mission, you always pay attention to your surroundings, calculating, analyzing, and using that as information.																						
106	106		301								Ayla	That is a good habit. Many excellent creators do that as well.	1																					
107	999		204							1	4																							
108	107		301									Ayla suddenly pauses, seemingly thinking about her missing friend again.																						
109	109		301								Ayla	Can you tell me?	1																					
110	110		301									She adjusts her posture and straightens her back a little bit as if she is preparing for a hard-to-swallow truth or her death sentence.																						
111	111		301								Ayla	What did you see in the "theater play" just now?	1																					
112	112		302								It was a story about an evil dragon.	113																						
113	113		301									Ayla does not look surprised at all.																						
114	114		301								Ayla	Were you the champion? Or should I say, were you playing the champion in that story?	1																					
115	115		302								I'm not sure.	116	Perhaps, I was.	116	There was no champion in that story.	116																		
116	116		301								Ayla	...	1																					
117	117		302								In the end, the dragon killed "me."	118																						
118	118		301								Ayla	The ending of the story I remembered...	1																					
119	119		301								Ayla	...It was nothing like this.	1																					
120	120		302								Did Selena write this story?	121																						
121	121		301								Ayla	Have you heard of "The Acadia Evacuation"?	1																					
122	122		302								I have.	123	I haven't.	123	...	123																		
123	123		301									It is an opera, a perfect piece of performance art written by a young, talented artist. Its debut in the magnificent grand theater of Babylonia was a sold-out show. People tried desperately to get a ticket.																						
124	124		301								Ayla	It was the first opera Selena performed on stage and her first opera that became known to the public.	1

133	133		301									The anticipated ending stays true to the original: a happy reunion.																						
134	134		301									Back then, Ayla was not sure if there was any meaning to this. After she has embarked on the same journey, she slowly realizes the truth.

141	141		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Allen	After "The Acadia Evacuation" achieved success, Selena turned down all the invitations, be it interviews or celebration parties. Instead, she filed a request for a holiday. I allowed it.	1																					
142	142		301								Allen	Some artists worry that they'd lose themselves in this world of distractions. That's perfectly understandable. Back then, I believed "The Acadia Evacuation" was merely the beginning of Selena's great career.	1

146	146		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Selena is unlike any artist of the new generation. She is lauded by the media, but Allen never finds her indulging the attention. Her hair is messy, her steps hurried, and she has nary a hint of vanity despite her success.																						
147	147		301									It is almost as if she is still fighting her enemies in an eternal conflict, and there is no time for her to rest or even catch a breath.																						
148	148		201							1	500111																							
149	149		301							1	Allen	She filed a request for a long-term lease of WGAA's theater machine Hamlet and access to data submission.	1																					
150	150		202							1					1																			
151	151		301									That is when Allen notices that Selena is keeping some dated files and software with her, including the notebook she used when she first joined the WGAA.																						
152	152		301									A very traditional way of creating and keeping records.																						
153	153		301									Curious, he asks Selena about what is in the notebook.

158	158		204							2																								
159	159		301								Selena	It's an unfinished fantasy. I wrote it before I started doing operas, and it was a mess because I lacked experience at the time.	2																					
160	160		301								Allen	So, it's your first story, but you haven't finished it yet?	1																					
161	161		301								Selena	Yes... my first story. I had an idea about how it should end, but I never wrote it down. After exchanging some thoughts with a friend recently, I've gained some new ideas and perspectives.	2																					
162	162		301								Allen	Are you going to make changes to the original story?	1																					
163	163		301									Selena pauses for a brief moment before she smiles.

176	176		204							1																								
177	177		301								Ayla	Hamlet is the name of WGAA's holographic AI theater play machine.	1																					
178	178		301								Ayla	Using the latest technology, it provides a completely immersive experience, unlike any traditional theater performance. But this technology is still in development and costly, so it hasn't been widely adopted.	1																					
179	179		301								Ayla	The machine you are using right now is the only one on Babylonia. Its regular maintenance is done by a department of the Science Council and governed by the Control Court.	1																					
180	180		301								Ayla	As for the name, Chairman Allen picked "Hamlet" himself.	1

185	185		301								Ayla	Many people thought Selena had given up on opera and art.	1																					
186	186		301								Ayla	But that's not the case. On the contrary, Selena chose to become a Construct because she was pursuing art. She wanted to portray truth in her work.	1																					
187	187		301								Ayla	Many people believe Selena had lost all hope to live when she was on the mission in the space station.	1

202	202		301								Ayla	Hamlet's database shows Selena uploaded three entries.	1																					
203	203		301								Ayla	All the data was uploaded to the same software pack with simple encryption.	1																					
204	204		301								Ayla	The first upload happened shortly after Selena joined the WGAA. The second upload was after the performance of "The Acadia Evacuation". And the third was before her last mission in the space station.	1																					
205	205		202							1					1																			
206	206		301									This story has more than just one ending. Perhaps Selena made multiple changes to the storyline.																						
207	207		301									She rehearsed this story countless times.																						
208	208		301									It is something Selena mentioned briefly in her letters. You can also learn this from the data history in Hamlet's backend.																						
209	209		301									As the playwright, the actress, and the audience, what is it that you wanted to convey? What did you experience? And what did you feel?																						
210	210		301									Ayla cannot help but wonder about these questions.																						
211	211		301									There is a way to crack open the Hamlet software.																						
212	212		301									But rather than ravaging it and tearing it apart, she wants to experience and listen as a character in the story or an audience. She wants to experience the message Selena left behind.																						
213	213		301									She wants to rely on her intuitions and inspirations to seek that fleeting echo.																						
214	214		301									Perhaps she is just trying to comfort herself. Maybe her stubbornness is meaningless, and the different endings never existed. She may never understand, despite how much she emphasizes.
