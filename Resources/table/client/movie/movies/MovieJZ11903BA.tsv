42	42		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						She did not know how to respond to Allen then, but the answer is as clear as day now.																						
43	43		301									It is because of her arrogance.																						
44	44		301									That arrogance is rooted in every fiber of her being.																						
45	45		301									She had depicted a hell that did not exist, eulogized false ideals of war and peace, and extolled her perceived ideas of humanity's glory.																						
46	46		301									What shameless arrogance that was. She had "an epiphany" during the soldier's rebuke and was determined to redeem herself for her arrogance. That made her determined to become a Construct.																						
47	47		301									Because as a Construct, she would one day have the chance to step onto a real battlefield, to truly experience hell for herself, and with that, she would personally compose a 'reality' that no one can find fault with.																						
48	48		301									It was not until she was truly in hell that she realized how arrogant her so-called notion of "redemption" was.																						
49	49		301									To think she became a Construct for such a foolish reason. To think she entered the battlefield for such stupidity.																						
50	50		301									It was wrong of her, she knew that now. She should not have left her comfortable and cozy home for such naive and frivolous reasons, or her half-baked epiphany.																						
51	51		301									What significance did the art that she dearly loved have?																						
52	52		301									What significance did those operas and music hold, that she had her fought so hard for them till this point.																						
53	53		301									What this place needs are weapons that can eliminate enemies and zealousness that can end wars. Her ludicrous beliefs about art are nothing but self-reassurance, no different from self-paralysis.
