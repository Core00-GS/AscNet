4	4		301									A rainbow of lights from the chandeliers glisten in the ballroom, the crisp tinkling of glasses and silverware ringing around the room. Laughter and toasts weave together into a festive waltz.																						
5	5		301									The band performing on the stage is playing the newly recovered Golden Age single from Squared Circle last month. The ecstatic electronic music paints a romantic picture of a time long gone.																						
6	6		301									Men and women dressed to the nines, delicacies served on silverplates, cocktails brimming with colors... The guests have been transposed to a strange fairy tale, leaving the war behind for a moment of respite.

11	11		302								Nothing.	12	Bianca, you're getting a little too close...	14																				
12	12		301								Bianca	Is that so?	1																					
13	13	16	301								Bianca	The other commandants are all socializing. Why aren't you joining them?	1																					
14	14		301								Bianca	...My mission is to make sure of your safety.	1																					
15	15	19	301								Bianca	But if you think it would affect your ability to socialize, then I'll keep my distance.	1																					
16	16		302								Maybe they've noticed how close you're standing...	17																						
17	17		301								Bianca	...	1																					
18	18		302								And they assume I already have company...	24																						
19	19		302								That would be great. Thanks.	20	That's not what I meant!	20																				
20	20		301								Bianca	...	1																					
21	21		302								It's just that, the way you've been following me...																							
22	22		301								Bianca	...	1																					
23	23		302								They might assume that I already have company.	24																						
24	24		301								Bianca	...	1																					
25	25		301								Bianca	I'm sorry.	1																					
26	26		302								It's fine. This is nice.	27	I'm happy to have you as my company if you're willing.	28																				
27	27	33	301								Bianca	I'll be waiting for you at the door. Please let me know immediately if you need anything.	1																					
28	28		301								Bianca	I'll pass. My job here is to keep you safe...	1																					
29	29		302								It doesn't have to be one way or the other.	41																						
30	33		302								Are you leaving me behind?	34																						
31	34		301								Bianca	I'm still nearby. I'm just guarding the door.	1																					
32	35		301								Bianca	No matter what happens, I will not leave you behind, Commandant. Your safety is my top priority.	1																					
33	36		302								I can always count on you, Bianca.	37	I was just joking!	41																				
34	37		301								Bianca	I'm just doing my job.	1																					
35	38		302								But if you would join me at the ball...	39																						
36	39		301								Bianca	...	1																					
37	40		302								It'll make me very happy...	41																						
38	41		301								Bianca	But...	1																					
39	42		302								This is Babylonia. No one's going to stab me in the back.	43	I'm the Gray Raven Commandant. I can protect myself.	43																				
40	43		301								Bianca	But the mission I received was to guard you in all your public functions.	1																					
41	44		302								Isn't that just spying on me?!	45																						
42	45		301								Bianca	The President was just worried about your safety.	1																					
43	46		301								Bianca	After all, Babylonia knows so little about Ascendants, and you're the only commandant who has had meaningful contact with them.	1																					
44	47		302								Sigh, fine.	48	So are you just going to stand there the whole time?	48																				
45	48		301								Bianca	...If it makes you feel better if I do as you say?	1																					
46	49		302								Maybe.	50	Of course!	50																				
47	50		301								Bianca	Very well.	1																					
48	51		301								Bianca	...	1																					
49	52		301								Bianca	...	1																					
50	53		301								Bianca	What do I do next?	1																					
51	54		302								Just accompany me out there.	55	Have you not been to a gala before, Bianca?	60																				
52	55		301								Bianca	Ah. Alright.	1																					
53	56		301								Bianca	I'm sorry. I've never been to an event with the objective to socialize.	1																					
54	57		302								Why?	60	Has the Purifying Force never hosted any parties?	60																				
55	60		301								Bianca	Constructs don't need to socialize.	1																					
56	61		301								Bianca	Maybe some of my colleagues would have private gatherings, but as long as those don't interfere with their work, I wouldn't intervene.	1																					
57	62		302								Don't be so strict on yourself.	63	Then let me show you a good time today!	63																				
58	63		301								Bianca	...	1																					
59	64		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Bianca	Thanks, Commandant.	1
