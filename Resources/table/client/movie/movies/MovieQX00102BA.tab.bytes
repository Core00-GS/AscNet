4	4		301									With an assortment of tools in their hands, they gather together as if to make something.

7	7		301							1	Liv	What is everyone doing?	1																					
8	8		301								Pulao	It's from an event of the Double Seventh Festival.	2																					
9	9		201							1	500124	1	-400																					
10	10		301							1	Changyu	If the craft you made with your lover passes the pre-selection, you'll get the VIP ticket to the mechanical puppet show.	1																					
11	11		302								Is it different from a regular ticket?	12																						
12	12		301								Changyu	VIP tickets can be used to participate in the lucky draw! The jackpot is a million grubs!	1																					
13	13		302								Sounds just like how Akdilek does things.	14																						
14	14		301								Changyu	It's nothing compared to the marketing campaigns on the train.	1																					
15	15		301								Pulao	The ticket is just a way to attract people. I was the one who came up with the event!	2																					
16	16		301								Pulao	The Double Seventh Festival is all about "craftiness" and "love."	2																					
17	17		301								Pulao	Do you guys want to give it a try?	2																					
18	18		302								...	19	Let's focus on being "crafty."	19																				
19	19		201							1	500127		-400																					
20	20		301							1	Sophia	Got it, Commandant. You can't find a suitable partner.	1																					
21	21		301								Pulao	Oh, well... It doesn't matter, as long as you work in pairs to make the craft. Let's all join in!	2																					
22	22		201							1	500166		-400																					
23	23		301							1	Lucia	Making crafts...	1																					
24	24		301									Lucia looks down pensively at her hands, gently clenching her fist before opening it again.	1																					
25	25		301							1	Lucia	Although we're installed with some parts assembly knowledge, I don't think it's the same type of crafts you're talking about.	1																					
26	26		201							1	500124		-400																					
27	27		301							1	Changyu	It doesn't have to be "handmade."	1																					
28	28		301								Changyu	It doesn't matter if you buy or trade for it. It's okay as long as you can bring something qualified with you.	1																					
29	29		302								I see... It's another part of your sales campaign.	30																						
30	30		201							1	500127		-400																					
31	31		301							1	Sophia	It's okay if you don't want to buy a finished product. There are parts on sale over there.	1																					
32	32		202							1	2																							
33	33		301									The details of the event revealed by these two alarm you.																						
34	34		302								...I'll apply for reimbursement when I'm back.	35	There will be nothing to report if I don't do it...	35																				
35	35		201							1	500145	1																						
36	36		301							1	Pulao	So, are you joining? Yes? No?	1																					
37	37		302								Fine.	38																						
38	38		301								Pulao	Commandant, who are you going to work with?	1																					
39	39		302								All of you.	5001	I want...	48																				
40	5001		204							1																								
41	40		301								Pulao	No, it's against the event rules! You must work in pairs.	1																					
42	5002		204							1	1																							
43	41		301								Pulao	Of course, it doesn't matter who the guide follows. The rules don't forbid that!	1																					
44	42		301								Pulao	Once you've made a decision, we'll guide the other two!	1																					
45	43		301								Pulao	You guys are always working when you're together. Wouldn't it be great to make some special memories once in a while?	1																					
46	44		201							1	500166																							
47	45		301							1	Lucia	Special memories...	1																					
48	46		201							1	500145																							
49	47		301							1	Pulao	So? Who do you want to spend the festival with?	1																					
50	48		202							1																								
51	49		301									In terms of this topic, the three people around seem to have different concerns about it.																						
52	50		201							1	500166	1																						
53	51		201							2	1031001	1	-600																					
54	52		201							3	500026		600																					
55	53		301							1	Lucia	Commandant, are you buying the craft or making it yourself?	1																					
56	54		301									Lucia is thinking about how to accomplish the objective.	1																					
57	55		301								Liv	Commandant, your wounds have not healed yet. It's not good for you to strain yourself... I'm just a bit worried. Can I stay with you?	2																					
58	56		301									Liv is more concerned about your wellbeing than the crafts.	2																					
59	57		301									Lee looks around with his stone-cold face, not fully letting down his guard. Noticing your inquiring gaze, he turns to you.	3																					
60	58		301								Lee	Don't worry about me. I'll go find some parts and assemble them on my own.	3																					
61	59		202								1	2	3		1																			
62	60		201							1	500145	1																						
63	61		301							1	Pulao	Have you made up your mind?	1

73	71		201							2	1031001	1	-600																					
74	72		201							3	500026		600																					
75	74		301							1	Lee	Then we'll get going to find the parts.	3																					
76	75		301								Pulao	And me! Let me be your tour guide.	1																					
77	76		301								Pulao	Right! When it comes to crafts, I've got something in mind! Come on, you have to experience this...	1																					
78	77		301									Pulao pats the worried-looking Liv on the back and points forward with a smile.	1																					
79	78		204							2	7																							
80	79		301							1	Liv	Eh? A-alright...	2																					
81	80		301									Liv is pulled into the crowd by Pulao before she can react. Pulao excitedly continues her introductory spiel as she drags her away.																						
82	81		202							1	2	3																						
83	6500		401							1	207																							
84	82		201							1	500166																							
85	83		302								We should go too.	84																						
86	84		301								Lucia	Yeah.	1																					
87	85		301								Lucia	Commandant, how do you plan to get the crafts? Do you want to buy them at the night market as Liv suggested?	1																					
88	86		302								Let's take a look around first.	87																						
89	87		204							1	1																							
90	88		301								Lucia	Alright.	1																					
91	89		301									Lucia seems to have loosened up and is now looking around.	1																					
92	90		301								Lucia	This isn't our first time on the Nighter, is it?	1																					
93	91		302								It isn't.	92																						
94	92		301								Lucia	Though I remember being here, the memory doesn't feel real.	1																					
95	93		301								Lucia	But in my M.I.N.D., I can still feel the anxiety when you weren't around...	1																					
96	94		301								Lucia	I remember tracking your signal to the Nighter, and then...	1																					
97	95		301									Lucia looks at the night market in the distance as if sifting for her own figure here in her memory data.																						
98	96		302								And then I came back.	97																						
99	97		301								Lucia	Yes. You came back.	1																					
100	98		204							1	6																							
101	99		301									Realigning with the most familiar part of her memory, Lucia comes back to herself and nods.																						
102	100		301								Lucia	Then, we fought in the battle together...	1																					
103	101		301									Lucia looks through her past, but droops her head again at the foreign feeling of that piece of memory.																						
104	102		204							1	1																							
105	103		301								Lucia	Do you mind going on a stroll with me, „Äêkuroname„Äë? I'd like to find that familiar feeling again.	1																					
106	104		302								Of course.	105																						
107	105		301									Lucia moves closer to you. You two walk on the deck shoulder to shoulder. The noises around gradually fade.	1																					
108	106		301									Looking at the ring in the distance, you recall Lucia dressing up and dancing there with her sword. Perhaps you should tell her about this?	1																					
109	107		302								Lucia...	108																						
110	108		204							1																								
111	109		301								Lucia	Yes?	1																					
112	110		301									Lucia follows your gaze to the ring in the distance.																						
113	111		301								Lucia	I remember that place...	1																					
114	112		302								Pulao gave you a set of clothes then.	113																						
115	113		301								Lucia	Yes, she did.	1																					
116	114		301									You tell Lucia more about what happened here that day.																						
117	6001		204							1																								
118	115		301								Lucia	I beat everyone...	1																					
119	116		302								You did.	117	You were impressive.	117																				
120	117		301								Lucia	The memory is somehow unreal to me now.	1																					
121	118		301									She looks at the ring with a hazy expression. If she stands there once again, could she find more of herself back?	1																					
122	119		302								Let's go take a look.	120																						
123	120		301								Lucia	But there are no other contestants there.	1																					
124	121		302								I'd like to see you...	122	...dressing up and dancing there once again.	122																				
125	6002		204							1	1																							
126	122		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	...If you insist.	1

128	124		201							1	500151																							
129	125		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		Lucia changes into the Eventide Glow coating and enters the ring again. A fighting puppet, sensing a challenger on the stage, enters the ring as well, standing opposite her.																						
130	126		301								Lucia	The puppet seems to be the champion of the last tournament.	1																					
131	127		302								The champion?	128																						
132	128		301								Lucia	It says so here on the notice. Since no one could defeat the puppet in the last tournament, the prize pool has remained.	1																					
133	129		301								Lucia	The prize... is that beautiful statue. It should be enough for the festival event, shouldn't it? Should I participate?	1																					
134	130		302								Yeah, go on. Find the "Lucia" on that day.	131	Yeah, the prize is waiting for you.	131																				
135	131		301								Lucia	Alright.	1																					
136	132		201							1	500152					1																		
137	133		301							1		Lucia draws her sword and points it at the puppet in front of her. Taking it as a signal to start, it swings its bladed arms at her.	1																					
138	14801		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryHitNew.prefab	3																							
139	14802		401							2	10002001	5																						
140	14803		502							RImgBg1Shake																								
141	134		301									The blade slashes through her blurring figure, only managing to leave two trails on the ground. Lucia has already hopped back, landing on some ornately carved steps beside.	1																					
142	14804		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryHitNew.prefab	3																							
143	14805		401							2	10002001	5																						
144	14806		502							RImgBg1Shake																								
145	135		301									Before the puppet can react, a crescent arc from behind disrupts its footing. Lucia takes the opportunity to jump up and strike at the puppet's head, the flash of her sword blooming like a lotus.	1																					
146	136		301									Unable to retaliate, the fighting puppet lets out a hoarse cheer and staggers, then falls to the ground.	1																					
147	137		302								(Applaud)	138	That was beautiful.	13811																				
148	138		201							1	500151					1																		
149	139	141	301							1		Hearing the applause from behind, Lucia sheathes her sword and turns over at you. Under the dim light on the ring, a hint of redness seems to be lining her cheeks.	1																					
150	13811		201							1	500151					1																		
151	140		301								Lucia	Really? I'm glad you liked it.	1																					
152	141		301								???	Never thought I'd have a chance to come here and witness your sword dance again.																						
153	142		203							1	0.25	-400																						
154	143		201							2	500143		400																					
155	144		301							1		Looking back, a Construct holding a red umbrella is standing nearby.	1																					
156	145		302								It's been a while.	146																						
157	146		301								Yazi	It wasn't that long before that last battle.	2																					
158	147		301								Lucia	That last battle?	1																					
159	148		301								Yazi	That's right, I was also here with... "Qu" during the tournament back then.	2																					
160	149		301								Yazi	...	2																					
161	150		301									Yazi falls into a short daze, seemingly remembering something, but soon returns to her normal state.																						
162	151		301								Yazi	Now that you've won, you should take the statue. It'll be enough for that ruckus out there.	2																					
163	152		301								Lucia	Thank you.	1																					
164	153		301									Lucia takes the prize before handing it to you.																						
165	154		301								Lucia	Can I give it to you as a gift?	1																					
166	155		302								It belongs to us both.	156																						
167	156		301								Lucia	Right...	1																					
168	157		301								Yazi	But it's not worthy of your sword dance. What else would you want?	2																					
169	158		301								Lucia	...What I want?	1																					
170	159		301									Lucia lowers her head and thinks for a while, then looks up into your eyes.																						
171	160		301								Lucia	I want to... create some new memories.	1																					
172	161		301								Lucia	Memories with „Äêkuroname„Äë.	1																					
173	162		301									Yazi points to the opposite compartment where a guqin sits.	2																					
174	163		301								Yazi	Do you wish to learn the guqin?	2																					
175	164		301								Lucia	The guqin...?	1																					
176	165		301								Yazi	I don't know what kind of memories you're referring to, but being taught the art of guqin... was a nice piece of memory for me.	2																					
177	166		301								Yazi	I could teach you if you want.	2																					
178	167		301								Lucia	I'm not sure I'm built for this...	1																					
179	168		302								Of course you are.	169	I'd like to hear you play.	169																				
180	169		301								Lucia	Then I'll give it a try.	1																					
181	170		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Yazi	I'll upload the guqin score data to her. It'll take but a moment.	2																					
182	171		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory176.png																								
183	172		201							2	500143		400																					
184	173		201							1	500151		-400																					
185	174		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The two walk over to the guqin and perform a simple transmission and tuning.																						
186	175		301								Yazi	Give it a go.	2																					
187	6003		202							1	2				1																			
188	6004		201							1	500151																							
189	176		301									Lucia nods and sits in front of the guqin. She raises her hand and plucks the strings in front of her. Notes fall into the lake like flower petals and leaves, echoing in the pavilion with the ripples of peace.	1																					
190	177		301									All of a sudden, the gentle, breeze-like style changes into a tempest. Her fingers dance over the strings of the guqin, imaginary drums and horns reverberating in unison, like blood and iron burning before your eyes.	1																					
191	178		301									The sounds suddenly halt at a blood-boiling climax. And when she resumes, it is followed by a mournful sound, like the night rain falling on abandoned weapons in the wasteland, leaving only sorrowful echoes behind.	1																					
192	179		301									After the song, Lucia lays her hands between her knees and looks this way timidly, as if asking for your opinion.	1																					
193	180		302								That was beautiful.	181																						
194	181		301								Lucia	Then I'm relieved. I was worried you wouldn't like this kind of music.	1																					
195	182		302								It's like our fights together.	183	It's like our memories.	183																				
196	183		301								Lucia	Yes... I feel the same way.	1																					
197	6006		201							1	500143																							
198	184		301							1	Yazi	So, are you happy with this extra "prize"?	1																					
199	6007		201							1	500151																							
200	185		301							1	Lucia	Yes, thank you.	1																					
201	6008		201							1	500143																							
202	186		301							1	Yazi	We were in a hurry, so I didn't get to teach you much. But it's good that you've made some new memories with it.	1																					
203	187		301								Yazi	It's late. I guess the others would be back by now. Go meet the others.	1																					
204	6009		201							1	500151																							
205	188		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	You're right. Let's go.	1

209	193		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Liv	Commandant...?	1																					
210	194		301									Liv seems a bit surprised.	1																					
211	195		201							1	500145	1																						
212	196		201							2	500124		-600																					
213	197		201							3	500026		600																					
214	198		301							1	Pulao	Alright, I'll be the guide for the other two.	1																					
215	199		301								Changyu	Don't you still have to patrol the place?	2																					
216	200		301								Pulao	Guiding IS patrolling.	1																					
217	201		201							1	500166	1																						
218	202		301							1		Lucia falls silent. She merely stares at you two quietly.																						
219	203		301								Lee	Lucia, let's see if we can find any useful parts around.	3																					
220	204		202							2	3																							
221	205		301								Lucia	Yeah, let's meet here after again getting our crafts, Commandant.	1																					
222	206		302								Okay.	207																						
223	207		301									Lucia only turns to follow the group that just departed after you nod at her.																						
224	7001		202							1																								
225	209		302								We should get going too.	208																						
226	208		201							1	1031001	6																						
227	210		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Liv	(Nods) ...Let's go to the night market and see if there are any crafts for sale that meet the requirements.	1

229	7500		401							1	207																							
230	212		201							1	1031001	1																						
231	213		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		You arrive at the entrance of the night market with Liv. The buildings here are still the same as they were, but the vendors look understandably calmer.																						
232	214		301								Liv	I wonder what kind of crafts would pass the pre-selection...	1																					
233	215		301								Craftsman	Homemade mechanical puppets! Check it out, 20% off for the festival!																						
234	216		301									The craftsman yells as he grins at the oncoming guests.																						
235	217		301								Craftsman	He notices that Liv is not human and freezes for a while, but soon returns to normal.																						
236	218		301								Craftsman	Nice lady, would you like one? Great for homes and travels, suitable as bodyguards and babysitters, these are simply the best!																						
237	219		301								Liv	Commandant, what do you think?	1																					
238	220		302								Sounds practical.	221	I don't think it can pass the pre-selection.	224																				
239	221		301								Liv	Well...	1																					
240	222		301								Craftsman	It's more than practical. The ones on the left can also sing operas!																						
241	223	225	301								Liv	I think we'll pass. Thank you.	1																					
242	224		301								Liv	Let's go somewhere else.	1																					
243	225		301								Craftsman	Hey, don't go! I can make it any way you want, it just takes a little time and... some more grubs.																						
244	226		301								Liv	Thanks, we'll be back later.	1																					
245	227		301									After saying goodbye to the craftsman with the mechanical puppets, the two of you squeeze into the bustling crowd.																						
246	228		301								Liv	I haven't seen anyone like that man before...	1																					
247	229		302								That man?	230																						
248	230		204							1	6																							
249	231		301								Liv	Ah... sorry, you were unaware of the reason for the dispute here before.	1																					
250	232		301									Liv explains in detail what happened the last time she was on the Nighter.																						
251	7701		204							1	14																							
252	233		301								Liv	I was too reckless... if you hadn't arrived in time, it would have been trouble.	1																					
253	234		302								But I had.	235																						
254	235		204							1	6																							
255	236		301									Liv puts her hands on her chest and nods gently.	1																					
256	238		301								Liv	...I'm glad you don't find me troublesome.	1																					
257	239		301								Liv	But if I had left a sick person alone, I would definitely have regretted it even more afterward.	1																					
258	240		302								There's nothing wrong with being kind.	241																						
259	241		204							1	1																							
260	242		301								Liv	(Nods) ...I'm relieved to hear you say this.	1																					
261	243		301								Liv	How about we go pick out gifts for everyone?	1																					
262	244		301									Liv turns around with a smile and walks in delight.	1																					
263	245		301								Liv	There are a lot of people at the stall over there. Let's go take a look, shall we?	1																					
264	246		302								(Nod)	247																						
265	247		301								Liv	This clockwork frog is so cute! Although it can't be used for pre-selection, should we still buy it for Lucia?	1																					
266	248		302								Sure.	249	Let's keep looking.	253																				
267	249		301								Vendor	Thank you!																						
268	250		301								Liv	Will Lucia be delighted to see this?	1																					
269	251		301								Liv	But... it should be fine if you say so.	1																					
270	252	255	301									Liv pockets the clockwork frog carefully and gently smiles.	1																					
271	253		301								Liv	Hmm... if you say so.	1																					
272	254		301									Liv puts the clockwork frog down carefully and gives an apologetic smile.	1																					
273	255		301								Liv	This set of tools is rare. Would Lee like it...?	1																					
274	256		302								He does like practical things.	257	Let's keep looking.	260																				
275	257		301								Liv	You're right... You know everyone so well.	1																					
276	258		301								Liv	Please, this tool set.	1																					
277	259		301								Vendor	Good choice! Here.	1																					
278	260		301								Liv	Well, where do you want to go next, Commandant?	1																					
279	261		301									Liv sidles closer to you and looks at you in anticipation.	1																					
280	262		302								Let's go buy a gift.	263																						
281	263		301								Liv	Oh? Who is it for?	1																					
282	264		302								Liv.	265	What do you want, Liv?	265																				
283	265		204							1	6																							
284	266		301								Liv	Huh? F-for me?	1																					
285	267		301									Liv lowers her head and blushes.	1																					
286	268		301								Liv	I just... want you to recover soon...	1																					
287	269		301								Liv	As long as you can stay with me... with us, it'd be the best gift for me.	1																					
288	270		302								I'll stay with you.	271	But I also want to find a gift for you.	271																				
289	271		301								Liv	...Is that so?	1																					
290	272		204							1	14																							
291	273		301									She clutches her hands, trembling as if hesitating to say something.																						
292	274		202								1																							
293	275		301									Just then, a roar resounds from afar.																						
294	276		201							1	500136																							
295	277		301							1	???	Get out!	1																					
296	278		301								Skinny Boy	Please...																						
297	279		301									Looking in the direction of the roar, you see two slender figures being pushed to the ground. One of them is crawling and grasping at the assailant's leg with a broken prosthesis.																						
298	280		301								???	Let go of me!	1																					
299	281		301								Skinny Boy	...This is the item your partner asked for, and I've brought it here... She said she'd buy it...																						
300	282		301								Sick Girl	Brother...																						
301	283		301								???	No one wants your rotting organ! Why don't ya take it home and grill it to feed your dying sister!	1																					
302	284		301								Skinny Boy	It's all fresh... and it was preserved in the way she said... W-why won't you...																						
303	285		301								???	I said I don't want it!	1																					
304	286		301									He stomps on the prosthetic hand clutching onto his left leg, but it does not let go even in its half-broken state.																						
305	287		301								???	Hand me a fresh one from your own body, and maybe I'll think about it.	1																					
306	288		301								Skinny Boy	O-okay...																						
307	289		301									Not expecting that he would agree, the tall man freezes for a minute. He then grabs the boy by the hair and picks him up.																						
308	290		301								Skinny Boy	I'll sell anything... if I can get enough money from it...																						
309	291		301								???	What do you need money for if you don't have your life to spend it?	1																					
310	292		301								Skinny Boy	If I can get my sister to a safe zone... and get her treated, that'll be enough...																						
311	293		301								Sick Girl	(Sobs)																						
312	294		301									Hearing this, the man sneers and throws the boy to the ground.																						
313	295		201							1	1031001	7																						
314	296		301							1	Liv	...!	1																					
315	297		201							1	500136																							
316	298		301								???	Hmph, the woman who'd buy it turned herself into this a long time ago.	1																					
317	299		301									He shakes the bag of grubs in his hands and laughs indifferently.																						
318	300		301								???	You might still have a way out if you leave your sister behind.	1																					
319	301		201							1	1031001	14																						
320	302		301							1	Liv	Commandant! Please... please allow me to...	1																					
321	303		302								(Go stop him)	304																						
322	7702		201							1	500136																							
323	304		301									The tall man grabs a metal plate from his side, but is thrown to the ground the moment he tries to pummel the child with it.																						
324	305		301								???	The hell are you?!																						
325	306		201							1	1031001																							
326	307		301								Liv	Please stop it!	1																					
327	308		201							1	500136																							
328	309		301									He clearly has not expected a frail-looking girl like Liv would scold him.																						
329	310		301									Without so much of a further look, he spits in disdain and stands, again swinging the metal plate hard at the two.																						
330	311		301									But before he manages to do so, he is back on the ground. Liv has not even lifted her hands.																						
331	7101		201							1	1031001	14																						
332	312		301								Liv	Commandant, you're still wounded. Please don't be reckless!	1																					
333	7709		201							1	500136																							
334	313		301								???	You... you're a Construct? Tch!																						
335	314		301									Realizing it, the man takes a few steps back cautiously. He curses and spits, then disappears out of sight.																						
336	315		201							1	1031001	1																						
337	7405		301								Liv	Don't be afraid, you're safe now.	1																					
338	316		301							1	Skinny Boy	...																						
339	317		301									The skinny boy sits on the ground holding his sister in his arms, sobbing frantically.																						
340	318		301								Liv	May I take a look at your sister?	1																					
341	319		301									He looks up at Liv in hesitation.																						
342	320		301								Skinny Boy	Who... are you?																						
343	321		301								Liv	Trust me.	1																					
344	322		301									Perhaps it is Liv's smile, or because of how desperate he is, the boy relaxes the arms that hold his sister.																						
345	323		301									Liv gently takes the sick little girl and begins diagnosing her.																						
346	324		301								Liv	She's slightly infected by the Punishing Virus, but it appears more severe than average because of her weakened immune system.	1																					
347	325		301								Liv	Commandant, can I apply a serum on her?	1																					
348	326		302								(Nod)	327																						
349	327		301								Skinny Boy	Th-thank you...																						
350	328		301									Watching the serum slowly injecting into her body, he bursts into tears.																						
351	329		301								Skinny Boy	We don't have money for you, but if there's anything we can do...																						
352	330		302								Can you make crafts?	331																						
353	331		301								Skinny Boy	S-sure I can! Is it for the event on the ship?																						
354	332		302								That's right.	333																						
355	333		301								Skinny Boy	H-hold on, I'll be right back!																						
356	334		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					He takes out the only two grubs he has left and runs over to the place where parts are sold.																						
357	335		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Not until the drums of the market closing thump that the little girl in Liv's arms wakes. She tries to stand up and thank the two of you.																						
358	336		301								Liv	How do you feel? Better?	1																					
359	337		301								Sick Girl	Yes... thank you...																						
360	338		301									At this moment, a scurry of footsteps travels over. The skinny boy runs over with a small magpie made of old gears and copper wires.																						
361	339		301								Skinny Boy	J-just in time! This is for you!																						
362	340		301									The magpie he hands over looks ancient and rusty from the material, but it is still an impressive and detailed masterpiece.																						
363	341		302								That's beautiful, thanks.	342																						
364	342		301									After carefully putting away the metal magpie, you hand the remaining bag of grubs to the boy.																						
365	343		301								Skinny Boy	This is...																						
366	344		302								Commission fee for your craft.	345	Hope that helps.	345																				
367	345		301								Skinny Boy	Th-thank you...																						
368	346		301									The boy receives the bag of grubs in excitement with both hands, as if seeing a hint of light in the darkness, and he says nothing but thanks.																						
369	347		302								But, well...	348																						
370	348		301								Liv	What is it?	1																					
371	349		302								The market is closed already.	350																						
372	350		204							1	7																							
373	351		301									After realizing this, Liv lets out a small cry.																						
374	352		301								Liv	Ah, I didn't get a chance to buy you a gift... I was planning to buy it at the market...	1																					
375	353		302								I didn't get one for you, either.	354																						
376	354		204							1	14																							
377	355		301								Liv	I don't mind not getting one... What matters is that you... Aw...	1																					
378	356		301								Sick Girl	Miss... I've got a thank you gift for you...																						
379	357		301								Sick Girl	This garland made of bionic flowers was a thank you gift I got for helping repair a sculpture. Will you take it?																						
380	358		204							1	6																							
381	359		301								Liv	I...	1																					
382	360		301								Skinny Boy	Please take it!																						
383	361		302								Take it, Liv.	362																						
384	362		301								Liv	Commandant...	1																					
385	363		302								You deserve it.	364																						
386	364		301									Hearing this, the little girl happily places the garland in Liv's hand.																						
387	365		302								It'll look beautiful on you.	366																						
388	366		301								Liv	Would you... help me put it on?	1																					
389	367		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				Of course.	368																						
390	368		201							1	500207	6																						
391	369		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You put the garland on Liv's head and happen to brush her smooth, silvery hair. She blushes.	1																					
392	370		301								Liv	...How do I look?	1																					
393	371		302								You're, of course...	7411	You look gorgeous.	7411																				
394	7411		204							1	14																							
395	372		301								Liv	...Thank you.	1																					
396	7410		301								Liv	The garland... is the best gift I can think of.	1																					
397	7412		204							1	6																							
398	373		301								Liv	Commandant? You haven't told me what you want.	1																					
399	374		302								I'd like to see you happy.	375	Thanks for staying with me.	375																				
400	375		204							1	14																							
401	11375		301								Liv	...Ah.																						
402	376		301									Liv freezes for a while and quickly lowers her head, putting her hands on her chest. Although you cannot see her expression, you can feel her shoulders slightly trembling.																						
403	377		301								Liv	Thank you... Commandant. Thank you.	1																					
404	378		302								I'm the one who should thank you.	379																						
405	379		301								Liv	...Hmm...	1																					
406	380		301									Liv's voice is soft, and she seems to be in a bit of a daze.																						
407	381		302								We should get back.	382																						
408	11376		204							1	6																							
409	382		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	Yeah... let's go back together.	1

413	399		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		You think you can hear Lee sigh.	1																					
414	400		204							1																								
415	401		301								Lee	Don't you have other options?	1																					
416	402		302								There's no one but you.	403																						
417	403		301								Lee	What's this supposed to be? Some sort of training?	1																					
418	404		302								You know how to make little robots.	405	That's not a bad idea.	413																				
419	405		301								Lee	And you think that passes as a craft?	1																					
420	406		201							1	500145	1																						
421	407		301								Pulao	Of course! It's not about looks. As long as you make it delicate enough, there won't be a problem!	1																					
422	408		201							1	500026																							
423	409		301								Lee	...	1																					
424	410		302								You don't want to go with me?	11411																						
425	11411		204							1	6																							
426	411		301								Lee	...It's not like that.	1																					
427	11412		204							1																								
428	412	418	302								Let's go then.	413																						
429	413		204							1	10																							
430	414		301								Lee	Look at you, all running and jumping. I guess you're almost recovered, huh?	1																					
431	415		204							1																								
432	416		301									He looks at you in silence for a few seconds.	1																					
433	417		301								Lee	Never mind... Let's just get it done and come back as soon as possible.	1																					
434	418		301									He stops speaking and walks over.	1

439	423		301								Changyu	Don't you still have to patrol the place?	2																					
440	424		301								Pulao	Guiding IS patrolling.	1																					
441	425		301								Pulao	Oh yeah, by the way, there wasn't a winner in the last fighting tournament, so the prize is still here. Lucia, are you interested? You'll definitely get it if you give it a try.	1																					
442	426		301								Lucia	Is that so? Then let's go take a look.	3																					
443	427		201							2	1031001	1	-600																					
444	428		301							1	Pulao	Liv, would you like to take a look at the night market? There are a lot of interesting crafts on sale right now.	1																					
445	429		301								Liv	Yeah, I can buy some souvenirs for everyone.	2																					
446	430		301								Lucia	Commandant, we'll be waiting here for you after completing our tasks.	3																					
447	431		302								Alright.	432																						
448	432		202							1	2	3																						
449	433		301									As the three of them walk and talk, Lee turns around and looks at you.																						
450	434		201							1	500026																							
451	435		301							1	Lee	Which way?	1																					
452	436		302								Lee, is there anywhere you'd like to go?	437																						
453	437		301								Lee	No.	1																					
454	438		302								Then we can just walk around.	439

457	8500		401							1	207																							
458	441		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The two of you walk along the taffrail of the Nighter, listening to the sound of the waves until the moon shines right above you. The silver threads of moonlight pour from above, softly draping over Lee's silent profile.																						
459	442		301									Wordlessly, he walks on your left side. Only this time, his pace is slow, unlike his usual self.																						
460	443		302								Why are you walking so slowly?	444																						
461	444		301								Lee	You haven't recovered yet.	1																					
462	445		302								But last time...	446																						
463	446		301								Lee	Last time?	1																					
464	447		301									He turns in confusion, unable to comprehend your words.																						
465	448		302								I mean when we were picking up the parts.	1502	You kept walking ahead and then stopping to wait for me.	1502																				
466	1502		204							1	10																							
467	449		301								Lee	Do you always keep these trivial details in your mind?	1																					
468	450		302								It wasn't trivial.	1501																						
469	1501		204							1	6																							
470	451		301								Lee	...	1																					
471	1500		204							1																								
472	452		301								Lee	Unlike last time, there's no need to hurry now.	1																					
473	453		301								Lee	Besides, we've been fighting a lot lately. Since it's just a festival, there's no need to tire you out.	1																					
474	454		302								Why don't we just sit down, then?	455																						
475	455		301								Lee	Tired? Alright.	1																					
476	456		301									He looks around and sets his eyes on a sea-viewing pavilion not far away.	1																					
477	457		301								Lee	Let's go over there.	1																					
478	458		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				Okay.	459

480	460		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After sitting on the bench in the pavilion, you notice that Lee is looking at you.	1																					
481	461		302								What's the matter?	462																						
482	462		301								Lee	Are you tired?	1																					
483	463		302								I can still handle it.	464	Worried about me?	465																				
484	464	468	301								Lee	That's good.	1																					
485	465		204							1	6																							
486	466		301								Lee	You wish.	1																					
487	467		204							1																								
488	468		301									Lee looks away and sits down next to you, exceptionally silent.																						
489	469		301									The noises of the night market come from afar. Unlike that sparkling place, only moonlight, the sound of waves, and Lee are here.																						
490	8001		204							1																								
491	470		301								Lee	Regret coming here with me? We can still head for the market and buy some parts there.	1																					
492	471		301									It could be nice to walk around, but the long walk must have taken a toll on you, especially with your injuries. You are a little too exhausted for another long trek.																						
493	472		301								Lee	Would you like me to teach you some engineering theory? Not a bad idea to learn something in your free time.	1																					
494	473		302								Let's rest up first.	474	It's good enough to have you here.	475																				
495	474	480	301								Lee	...	1																					
496	475		204							1	6																							
497	476		301								Lee	...	1																					
498	477		302								Is your cooling device still broken?																							
499	478		301								Lee	Shut up.	1																					
500	479		204							1																								
501	480		301								Lee	Look over there.	1																					
502	481		301									You follow the direction Lee points and look at the starry sky.	1																					
503	482		301								Lee	There are three stars in the Milky Way to the southeast, Alpha Cygni, Alpha Lyrae, and Alpha Aquilae.	1																					
504	483		302								It's the "Summer Triangle", right?	484																						
505	484		301									Lee nods.																						
506	485		301								Lee	In Kowloong, Alpha Lyrae and Alpha Aquila seem to be called "Vega" and "Altair".	1																					
507	486		301								Lee	Which represent the "weaving maid" and the "cowherd."	1																					
508	487		301								Lee	I guess they are what the two protagonists in the Double Seventh Festival are based on.	1																					
509	488		302								I didn't know.	489																						
510	489		301									The two stars in the sky are on different sides of the Milky Way. Lee peels his eyes off the sky and looks at you.	1																					
511	490		301								Lee	The distance between the two stars is 16.4 light-years, or 160 trillion kilometers.	1																					
512	491		301								Lee	The average length of a magpie is 40 to 50 cm. Even without considering physics, it would take 330 quadrillion magpies to build a magpie bridge...	1																					
513	492		301								Lee	...	1																					
514	493		302								What is it?	494																						
515	494		301								Lee	Anyway, the magpie bridge is not possible.	1																					
516	495		302								Of course I know that. It's just a story.	496																						
517	496		301								Lee	...Humans in the past couldn't explain things beyond their understandings, so they'd make up all sorts of tales to address their confusion.	1																					
518	497		301								Lee	Even now, with powerful technology and high computing power, there are still things that I fail to understand.	1																					
519	498		302								Like what?	499																						
520	499		204							1	6																							
521	500		301								Lee	Nothing.	1																					
522	8003		204							1	10																							
523	501		301									He looks up at the starry sky and stops talking.																						
524	502		202							1																								
525	503		301									Perhaps because of the frequent battles or the unplanned relief, the endless ocean ahead fills you with drowsiness.																						
526	504		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The swaying ship with the sound of waves is like a perfect cradle. Even the noises of the night market from afar gradually fade.																						
527	505		201							1	500212																							
528	506		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					?	...Oh, you.	1																					
529	507		301									As you drift in and out of sleep, you seem to hear someone talking.																						
530	508		301								?	...You said you'd go with me, but I have no idea how to make you happy.	1																					
531	509		301								?	...The battles have been getting more frequent lately.	1																					
532	510		301								?	I know it's our duty, but I don't want to be commanded by you if you don't care about your own safety.	1																					
533	511		301									You want to answer him, but sleepiness sweeps over you and pulls you further into your dream.																						
534	512		301								?	„Äêkuroname„Äë... I don't want that kind of memories anymore.	1																					
535	513		301									The moon rises into the sky, and the sea breeze of the night blows across the railings, sending a chill to this quiet place.																						
536	514		301									You cannot help but shiver, but soon feel some kind of warmth dispelling the chill.																						
537	515		301									You fall into a deep sleep surrounded by the warmth.																						
538	516		301									In your dream, there is a piercing siren, but it is soon muffled by something, and its sound falls distant.																						
539	517		301									Then, a vague figure seems to approach you while being chased by a security robot.																						
540	518		301								???	Catch that thief!																						
541	519		301								?	Tsk.	1																					
542	520		302								...Another fight?	521																						
543	521		301								?	So noisy!	1																					
544	522		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					As you struggle to wake up, the harsh sounds suddenly disappear.																						
545	523		301									‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶																						
546	524		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You are not sure how long it has been, but you seem to hear someone sigh in your daze.																						
547	525		301								?	...Quite a sleepyhead you are. Learn to put up more of a guard.	1																					
548	526		301									You open your eyes to find yourself wrapped in Lee's warm coat. Soft cotton balls cover your ears, blocking the noise outside.																						
549	527		301									Removing them, you hear the sound of the crowd leaving reverberating from afar. The night market is coming to a close.																						
550	528		201							1	500026																							
551	529		301							1	Lee	You're awake?	1																					
552	530		302								Shoot, we haven't bought the parts!	531																						
553	531		301								Lee	There's no need.																						
554	532		301									He hands over a ship model, which looks almost identical to the Nighter.																						
555	533		302								...What's this?	534																						
556	534		301								Lee	I made it while you were asleep. It's probably enough for the event.	1																					
557	535		301									Looking closely at the delicate model of the Nighter, you cannot help but find the color scheme of some of the parts oddly familiar. They look like... the police robots on the Nighter?																						
558	536		302								...Where did you get the materials?	537																						
559	537		301								Lee	Well, that's a secret.	1																					
560	538		301									He stands up in the dim moonlight.																						
561	539		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lee	It's getting late. Let's go back.	1
