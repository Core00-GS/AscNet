3	3		301								Forsaken Soldier	...I see, t'was a really close call back there in the space station then. Mr. Watanabe, I thought you were going to ram right into that virus ball.

5	5		301							1	Watanabe	Same here. That was the plan too.	1																					
6	6		301									(It's still a bit early... But we've gotten enough rest, might as well set off.)																						
7	7		301									At the train station, a group of people in windbreakers are sorting their belongings, unfazed by the Corrupted remains scattered on the ground.																						
8	8		301								Watanabe	Didn't expect you to contact me. You removed Hassen or something?	1

12	12		301							1	Nikola	If he's that easy, I'd be at the helm, not contacting you Forsakens here. You people are ready, I hope?	2																					
13	13		301								Watanabe	Yeah. Just for the record, we aren't cooperating with you. We're only doing this because the Ascendants and the Corrupted are mankind's common enemies.	1																					
14	14		301								Nikola	Hmph, call this whatever you like, as long as you pull your weight.	2																					
15	15		301								Watanabe	So, how do we get to that "Kowloong" place? You gave us the coords, but we don't have any flyers left after the space station.	1																					
16	16		301								Nikola	That's why I had you rally here.	2																					
17	17		301								Watanabe	Ah, I see... You got Akdilek as well.	1																					
18	18		301									As Watanabe is trying to figure out Babylonia's agenda, a speeding train pulls into the station. Before it comes to a complete stop, two Constructs, Changyu and Sophia, jump off.

23	23		301							1	Changyu	...Huh. Y'know, we've been frequent trade partners, but this is my first time seeing the Forsaken boss in person. Nice to meetcha, old man.	2

31	31		301							1	Jamilah	I apologize on behalf of my two bodyguards. They're not very good with words.	2																					
32	32		301								Watanabe	So that's how it is? Akdilek's in cahoots with Babylonia and getting all prickly about us Forsakens, all thanks to that little train rendezvous?	1																					
33	33		204							2	1																							
34	34		301								Jamilah	T'was a diplomatic joke to lighten the mood. Surely you understand, right?	2

39	39		204							2	13																							
40	40		301								Jamilah	Then you'll have to redeploy some of your troops in Kowloong to keep us in place.	2																					
41	41		301								Nikola	Hmph... Anyhow, if you'll excuse me, I still have to attend to my commander duties. Please hold up your end of the bargain and send reinforcements to Kowloong.	1

47	47		204							2	4																							
48	48		301								Jamilah	Well then, Mr. Watanabe, leader of the Forsaken, listen. All carriages starting from No.5 are yours to use. Since we're short-handed at the moment, you'll have to move the equipment by yourselves.	2																					
49	49		301							1	Watanabe	...Is this another joke of yours? What's with the bunch of Corrupted on the back of the carriage?	1

55	55		301								Jamilah	Well, since you have nothing better to do right now, could you help clean the carriage? You did hitch a ride after all.	2
