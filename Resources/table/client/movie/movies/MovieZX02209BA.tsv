19	19		301							1	Liv	Our initial scan shows that the CPF is still running at low power. Parts of the centrifuge module at its base are down. The Punishing Virus concentration inside the tower is steadily rising.	1

21	21		301								Eleanor	Hmm... Some of the passageways inside have been blocked by plants formed by the Hetero-Creatures. It seems that we'll have to keep scanning even after we're inside to find the right way.

26	26		301								Hans	We're adjusting our plans.	1																					
27	27		301								Hans	Vanessa, your tactics are better suited to fighting on the surface. Take Egret and station outside the tower. Guard the entrance after everyone else enters.	1

32	32		301								Vanessa	Okay, okay.	2																					
33	33		301								Hans	Harley Jo, see the gap at the top of the CPF?	1

38	38		301								Harley Jo	Found it. Based on how the light is shining through, there does seem to be an opening underneath the branch at 11 o'clock.	1																					
39	39		201							1	500286																							
40	40		301							1	Hans	Right. Yata and you will climb up the CPF along those plants and open up that gap from the outside, creating a second path of retreat as a backup in case the inside teams cannot leave via their way in.	1

44	44		301							1	Hans	My team will lead inside the CPF, and Simon's will take the rear. Gray Raven stays in the middle, and we'll escort them to the closest point from the Hetero-Hive Mother, making sure they aren't worn down before fighting it.	1																					
45	45		301								Hans	Afterward, my team will deploy the bit domain nodes around the Hive Mother. Simon will help 【kuroname】 stabilize the Constructs inside the tower. Your Mind Beacons will be everything that stops the Constructs from being infected.	1
