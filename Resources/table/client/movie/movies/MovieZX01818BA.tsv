7	7		301								Kamui	Sigh... Negative.	2																					
8	8		301									Kamui and Chrome walk out from both sides of the ruins and reconvene in front of a huge pit to exchange intel. In the center of this pit are two raindrop-shaped airdrop capsules.																						
9	9		301									The high temperature upon entry had severely deformed the airdrop capsules' exterior. After opening the hatch, hot air continues to emit from within the cabins.

11	11		301								Kamui	I've never seen those interceptor drones we ran into during our descent.	2																					
12	12		301								Kamui	Looks like they were deliberately trying to slow us down.	2																					
13	13		301								Chrome	Well... Our mission is different this time.	1

15	15		301								???	Wretched bastards... What are more of those fools from Babylonia doing here? There's been enough delays already...

19	19		301									A dark object flies toward Chrome and Kamui. Instinctively, the Strike Hawks separate just in the nick of time.																						
20	20		301									After finding his footing, Chrome scans the flying object and discovers that it is a mechanical head emitting static electricity.																						
21	21		201							1	500155																							
22	22		301							1	Chrome	It's... Troy from Ouroboros...	1

25	25		301									Hearing Chrome utter this, Kamui sprints faster toward where the object is coming from.																						
26	26		401							2	1503																							
27	27		301			RImgBg1Shake						Right as he is about to reach the target position, Kamui swings his greatsword ferociously at the building in front of him, causing it to collapse.

36	36		301									The sound previously heard appears behind Kamui all of a sudden, and he is struck by a violent whirlwind.																						
37	37		401							2	10007001																							
38	38		301			RImgBg1Shake						With the dull crunch of metal from the impact, Kamui is sent flying into the air.																						
39	39		301									Right as Kamui is about to collide with the protruding steel bars in the distant ruins, a pale blue streak of lightning gallops across the ground.																						
40	40		301									In a flash, the lightning grabs Kamui and pulls him up along the wall with the steel bars.

46	46		301							1		The lightning gradually dissipates as Chrome reaches the top holding Kamui's hood.																						
47	47		301								Chrome	So... Looks like we found the culprit behind all of this.	1																					
48	48		301								Kamui	...That's not a Corrupted. Watch out, that's no ordinary enemy.	2

51	51		301							1	Gear?	I'm looking for that fool dressed in white. Do you know where he is hiding now?	1

53	53		301							1	Chrome	Nothing I can disclose currently.	1																					
54	54		201							1	500288																							
55	55		301							1	Gear?	Oh? By the look of your nameplate, you must be from the same squad. If I kill you, that should draw him out of hiding.	1

57	57		301							1	Kamui	Hmph, give it your best shot.	1																					
58	58		301								Kamui	Captain, let me go. I'm gonna smash his face in.	1																					
59	59		301									Kamui waves his greatsword in the air, but Chrome tightens his grip on Kamui's hood.
