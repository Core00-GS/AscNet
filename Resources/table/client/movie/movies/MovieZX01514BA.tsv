29	26		301									The two machines with identical exteriors stand opposite of each other, the stauncher one of the two returns its blade.																						
30	29		301								HNB1	What's going on here?	1																					
31	30		301								HBG3	It's 4:44:23 p.m. on the 28th. We are located in an inspection facility 14 kilometers away from the main urban district.	2																					
32	31		301								HBG3	We were scheduled to return back to the factory for routine inspection 14 days ago. But for some reason, we were left in this unmanned facility.	2																					
33	32		301								HBG3	My faulty functions have also not been repaired.	2																					
34	33		301								HNB1	Strange. I can't reach HQ.	1																					
35	34		301								HBG3	Me too. According to KCC Pulao Crew regulations, we should report back to HQ.	2																					
36	35		301								HBG3	Article 1 of the KCC Pulao Crew regulations, Tai'E shall not harm humans, or by inaction allow humans to come to harm; 2, Tai'E must obey orders from superiors; 3, when an order expires, Tai'E must return and await...	2																					
37	36		301								HNB1	Hey, hey, hey, I know the regulations. They're hardwired into my brain. You don't have to repeat it line by line!	1																					
38	37		301								HBG3	I'm just reminding you. I am perceiving a 35% chance that you will use this opportunity to go elsewhere.	2

43	42		301								HNB1	What about the batch of Tai'E sent with us for maintenance? Have you seen them?	1																					
44	43		301								HBG3	I've been here since I was activated. I checked, but there are no other Tai'E or human beings here except us. The external power supply for the whole facility has been cut and we are locked in this inspection facility.	2																					
45	46		301									HNB1 and HBG3 were originally a part of the 7th Division, which is subordinate to the Pulao Police Force. The police force usually carries out security work in the city with squads made up of two Tai'E units.																						
46	47		301									G3 is the latest model developed by the Fuxi Department in the HB Tai'E series, specializing in strategic analysis. B1 is an HN series model with a human emotion module, making it more oriented to the masses.																						
47	48		301									A squad utilizing both Tai'E models is often seen as the optimal composition.																						
48	51		301								HNB1	It has been fourteen days. Didn't any of the guards notice that we were missing?	1																					
49	52		301								HBG3	Existing information is not enough to accurately assess the situation. It is possible that we are taken away by human beings through illegal means.	2																					
50	53		301								HNB1	You can just say that we're stolen.	1																					
51	54		301								HNB1	Them thugs in the lower city areas have a growing appetite, huh? It used to be just robbery and extortion, now it looks like they've shifted their focus to public property...	1																					
52	55		301								HNB1	Oh, by the way, check to see if there are any dents or scuff marks on me. I just got it painted a month ago... uh, I mean, two months ago!	1

79	82		301									HBG3 stops scanning the surrounding environment, then crosses in front of HNB1 and steps into the room.																						
80	83		301									There are some supplies scattered on the ground. On the workbench, there is a half opened toolbox and a bag of moldy bread.																						
81	84		301								Unknown Creature	Squeak—																						
82	85		301									A gluttonous rat hops down from the workbench and skitters away from HBG3's feet.																						
83	86		301									HNB1 seems to be right about the factory being abandoned. It is as if the workers all decided to go on a smoking break and never came back, leaving all the tools in the same place.

122	128		301								HBG3	If my receiver isn't broken, yes.	2																					
123	130		301								Qu	War is always fraught with sacrifices. But as long as one last Kowloonger stands, until the moment that we all backup our minds—then victory will be ours.																						
124	131		301								Qu	And from then on, there will be no sweeter victory than this one in the annals of Kowloong.																						
125	132		301								Qu	The Kowloong Crew is the protector of the KCC. Every Corrupted we destroy, is another step toward our victory.																						
126	133		301								Qu	They will pay for setting foot on the sanctum that is Kowloong. We will prove here that the virus can be defeated. Kowloong will live on, until the end of the world.

133	142		301								HBG3	At present, my analysis has found no discrepancy in the audio. I have the highest level of analytic capability in Kowloong. The possibility of error is 0.3852%.	2																					
134	143		301								HBG3	I am designed for strategic analysis. According to an analysis based on previous data, the possibility of a war between humans breaking out is 12.252%. No matter the case, we must report for duty.	2																					
135	144		301								HNB1	Yes, I know. But who are we fighting against?! She just mentioned the "Corrupted", didn't she?	1																					
136	145		301								HBG3	She mentioned "Corrupted" and "Punishing Virus".	2																					
137	146		301								HBG3	No matter what enemies we need to confront, us Tai'E units will destroy them. Tai'E were born to fight for Kowloong.	2
