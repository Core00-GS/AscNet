13	13		301									The walls are about two meters tall and are painted bright red. On top of the walls are blue bricks and tiles with complicated patterns.																						
14	14		301									The two-door panels aren't the common steel type, but are made in timber with beautiful patterns.

19	19		301							1	Liv	It's a Kowloong style residence.	2																					
20	20		202							1	2				1																			
21	21		201							1	500026					1																		
22	22		301							1	Lee	The New Year is one of the traditional Kowloong festivals. I'm not surprised.	1																					
23	24		201							1	1031001	3				1																		
24	25		301							1	Liv	Huh? Is this incantation also a Kowloong tradition?	1																					
25	26		401							1	205																							
26	27		301									Liv points to an ink-wash painting on the door. The painting is highly abstract and not limited by mere techniques. It is full of emotions.																						
27	28		302								No...	29																						
28	29		302								I think it's us.	30																						
29	30		204							1	7																							
30	31		301								Liv	Huh?	1																					
31	32		301									Nanami once drew your portrait with a similar style, so you immediately recognize this painting.																						
32	33		302								This is Lucia.	34																						
33	34		201							1	500166	6				1																		
34	35		301							1	Lucia	Is that... me?	1

43	44		301							1	Liv	This must be Commandant then.	1																					
44	45		204							1	2																							
45	46		301								Liv	It's quite difficult to tell.	1																					
46	47		302								Trust me, it's already much better than before.	48	Looks no different from before.	51

52	53	54	301									Tiger bumps into your chest.																						
53	54		401							1	36																							
54	55		301									It then rises into the air and points its large eyes toward the painting. A red light quickly scans through it.

57	58		301									"Beep"

62	62		301			DialogEnable						In front of you is a Kowloong-styled mansion.																						
63	63		502							RImgBg1BlowUp																								
64	64		301									There are individual buildings on the four sides inside the vast mansion, which are connected through corridors.																						
65	65		301									The buildings are made from green bricks and tiles, decorated by a rock garden. In the center is a giant pagoda tree with a shiny marble table under it.																						
66	66		301									At the entrance are the three Constructs' equipment and... a broom?																						
67	67		505							RImgBg1BlowUp																								
68	68		201							1	500166					1																		
69	69		301							1	Lucia	It's our equipment.	1

76	76		301								Tiger	Meow... Meow...	1																					
77	77		401							1	203																							
78	78		301									Tiger urges you to cross the wood threshold. The moment you step into the yard, something happens.																						
79	79		202							1	2				1																			
80	80		401							2	1508																							
81	81		301								???	Squeak!																						
82	82		301									A lot of gray-black balls swarm out from all the corners: wall corner, bricks and tiles, under the tree... They soon take up almost half of the yard.																						
83	83		201							1	500166	5				1																		
84	84		301							1	Lucia	Corrupted?	1

86	86		201							2	1031001		400			1																		
87	87		301							1	Liv	No, I can't detect any Punishing reaction on them.	2																					
88	88		302								Liv, can I have an update on the surroundings?	89	Relax, Lucia.	92																				
89	89		202							1					1

94	94		203							1	0.25					1																		
95	95		301							1		Lucia nods at you, but still clenches her weapon and looks at the front vigilantly.																						
96	96		202							2																								
97	97		201							1	1031001	5				1																		
98	98		301							1	Liv	Their number keeps rising, but they don't seem aggressive.	1																					
99	99		301								Liv	Is this also Nanami's gift?	1																					
100	100		203							1	0.25	-400																						
101	101		201							2	500026		400			1																		
102	102		301							1	Lee	No. Look around us.	2																					
103	103		201							2	500166	5	400			1																		
104	104		301							1	Lucia	The walls... are deteriorating.	2																					
105	105		301								Liv	The tree is also withering. The more balls there are, the faster it dies.	1																					
106	106		301								Lucia	Let's get out of here just to be safe.	2																					
107	107		301								Lucia	...The door is blocked.	2																					
108	108		202							1	2				1																			
109	109		301									The door has been engulfed in a mist. When touched, it feels like steel instead. You cannot seem to go through.																						
110	110		301									More gray-black balls continue to appear, leaving less space for Gray Raven.																						
111	111		201							1	500479					1																		
112	112		301							1	Tiger	Meow!	1																					
113	113		301									Tiger starts to attack the balls, probably because it is annoyed by the decreasing space.

116	116		502						100	PanelActor1Shake																								
117	117		301									With no limbs available, it rams them with its strongest face armor. The balls are knocked away and disappear.																						
118	118		301									As Tiger gets more involved, the number of gray-black balls continues to decrease. The deterioration of the surroundings has also slowed, and even started to reverse.																						
119	119		401							2	1506																							
120	120		301									It feels like Tiger is removing dust from the environment.																						
121	121		301									Seeing what has happened, you have figured out how Nanami set her trials.																						
122	122		202							1					1																			
123	123		302								I see.	124																						
124	124		302								We probably have to "dust and clean" this place.	125																						
125	125		201							1	500166					1																		
126	126		301							1	Lucia	Dust and clean?	1																					
127	127		301									It's a spring tradition. Put it simple, we need to clean the house before New Year arrives.																						
128	128		301									After last year's incident, you looked up some information, but didn't expect it to come into use here.																						
129	129		203							1	0.25	-400																						
130	130		201							2	1031001		400			1																		
131	131		301							1	Liv	Dust and clean... So are these balls the dust?	2																					
132	132		204							1	5																							
133	133		301								Lucia	The mission is clear then. Let's clean this place together.	1																					
134	134		202							1	2				1																			
135	135		301									Lucia and other members soon join the "battle."																						
136	136		301									With no gun around, you look at the lonely but unmissable broom‚Äî																						
137	137		301									Pick up the broom and embrace the "battlefield"‚Äî
