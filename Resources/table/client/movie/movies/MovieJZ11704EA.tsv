9	9		301									Wiping out all of the Corrupted, all Luna wants is praise from her sister. Instead, all she gets is a bullet.																						
10	10		301									The bullet at point-blank range pierces her stomach and the Froggie plushy in her arms. The cotton stuffing flies into the air, gently fluttering to the ground like snow.

12	12		301							1	Luna	...Lucia?	1																					
13	13		301									Luna looks at the wound in her stomach in disbelief. No longer able to support herself, she slowly falls to her knees.

15	15		301							1	Letty	Quit calling me your sister! You disgust me... What sort of filthy monster such as you has a sister?	1

17	17		301							1	Luna	Monster? I'm a monster... I...	1																					
18	18		301									The previously suppressed noise once again begins to echo by Luna's ear as the Punishing Virus concentration starts to rise. Her breathing begins to quicken.

20	20		301							1	Luna	Agh... Argh!	1																					
21	21		301									Luna struggles to stabilize her breathing as she crawls toward Letty. She longs for an embrace that is not there.

60	60		301			RImgBg1Shake						Just as Letty pounds on the door to attract attention from outside, she hears something shaking from behind. She turns around to see Luna's surroundings starting to tremble.

69	69		401							2	1512																							
70	70		301									Before Letty is able to pull out her gun, her arm has been vaporized into thin air. Without giving her time to scream in pain, Luna pins her down onto the ground.																						
71	71		301									Luna's left arm has transformed into a blade that is now pressed against Letty's jugular. She glows with a sanguine aura, looking completely out of control.																						
72	72		301									But right at the last moment, Luna uses her last ounce of sanity to force her right hand, still not fully corrupted, to stop the blade's strike.																						
73	73		201							1	500254	17																						
74	74		301							1	Luna	Sis... Run...	1																					
75	75		202							1					1																			
76	76		301									Thinking she has caught Luna off-guard, Letty uses her other hand to pull out a dagger at her waist and stabs Luna.																						
77	77		201							1	500256	5																						
78	78		301							1	Letty	AAAAGGHHH! DIE, YOU MONSTER!!!	1

82	82		301									Sparks from the clash of metal-on-metal illuminates the factory with a flash before returning it to silence.																						
83	83		301									The dagger plunges into Luna's chest, but misses a vital point. Luna's arm, however, pierces Letty's throat.																						
84	84		301								Letty	Agh... Ugh...																						
85	85		301									Vital fluid spews out of Letty's mouth as the light in her eyes gradually fades.

111	111		301								Hiro	There was a giant explosion at the disposal plant, and a Corrupted escaped. She destroyed the nearest CPF before we even had time to react.	1																					
112	112		301								Hiro	We tried to stop her, but almost all of us were wiped out. Even our leader...	1																					
113	113		301								Collins	Hiro, my boy... Listen, you should take a break. Your memory shell must be busted. How could a Corrupted...	2

117	117		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						A girl in pristine white is hovering in the air, below her a trail of destruction and remains. Such contrast seems to give her an aura of unparalleled divinity.																						
118	118		301									Nearby Corrupted see the explosion from the onslaught and take notice of her. Thinking she is merely another human victim, they charge at her from all directions.																						
119	119		301								Luna	...Insects.																						
120	120		301									She raises her hand lightly, and spikes formed of the Punishing Virus pierce all of the surrounding Corrupted.																						
121	121		301									The remaining Corrupted come to their senses as they realize what she was, and begin to bow before her.																						
122	122		301								Hiro	It's her... She's the Corrupted... Our leader, he...																						
123	123		301								Collins	Corrupted? No... She's an angel... An ANGEL!																						
124	124		301									Either he has forgotten her name, or perhaps there is just that stark of a contrast with the Construct of before and the Luna of now.

126	126		301									Collins waves both hands childishly, laughing and crying at the same time.

136	136		301							1	Collins	Forget it... You don't understand. She could've killed everyone with just the wave of her hand. The only reason we are still alive is because she has no interest in us.	1

138	138		301									Watching Luna disappear into the distance, a fanatical smile adorns Collins' tear-stained face.

140	140		301								Collins	I'm afraid... she will either bring destruction to humanity... Or, perhaps, she will be the last dawn of its salvation.	1

147	147		301								Collins	Someone like her can't be labeled as a "Corrupted". She deserves to be called something else...	1
