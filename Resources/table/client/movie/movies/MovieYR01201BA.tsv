6	6		301								Hassen	That's right. Both Strike Hawk and Gray Raven have done a great job. You want to hear about how they roughed up the enemies on the ship?	1																					
7	7		301								Nikola	I only care about the result.	2																					
8	8		301								Hassen	That's a shame. I thought you'd be interested.	1																					
9	9		301								Nikola	The question I'm more concerned about is whether that ship is now headed for some place we've never been before.	2

15	15		301									As Nikola asks his question, Asimov walks in through the other entrance and gives his answer.																						
16	16		301									Asimov is wearing the same uniform he wears every day. He keeps moving his fingers as he does calculations in his head.

20	20		301							1	Nikola	Mm... back to the topic, how much do you know about this "Kowloong"?	2																					
21	21		301								Asimov	About the "ship" part, you two already know enough. As for the "city" part, on top of its coordinates, we also found out the name of the organization running it.	3																					
22	22		301								Nikola	So the name is...?	2																					
23	23		301								Asimov	Kowloong Corp.	3																					
24	24		301								Nikola	They went from a chamber of commerce to a corporation. What do you know about them?	2																					
25	25		301								Asimov	I don't know about their composition, but they're a big organization no less powerful than ours.	3																					
26	26		301								Hassen	A powerful organization, huh... If only we can have peaceful talks with them.	1																					
27	27		301								Nikola	Don't be naive, Hassen. A secretive organization like that is up to no good.	2																					
28	28		301								Asimov	Most organizations on the surface are hostile to us for no reason. I believe the best course of action is to send teams there in advance to back up Strike Hawk and Gray Raven.	3																					
29	29		301								Hassen	You guys are pessimists, huh?	1

31	31		301									After hearing their objections, Hassen shakes his head with a bitter smile. He doesn't retort because he knows what he said was just wishful thinking.																						
32	32		301									The world is going through an upheaval. One way or another, the catastrophe known as the Punishing Virus will enter the picture and twist the world as we know it.																						
33	33		301									By the time anyone wakes up to its existence, they will have already been caught in its abyss.																						
34	34		301									Babylonia, the Ascendants, the Forsaken, Akdilek, the Route Union, Kowloong, and all the other surviving humans scattered on Earth.																						
35	35		301									Their solidarity breaks down and everyone grows stubborn in their opinions. Sometimes such stubbornness leads to conflict; sometimes it leads to self-destruction.

39	39		301							1	Hassen	And if we're going to have talks, we gotta do it from a position of strength...	1																					
40	40		301								Nikola	Talks or not, strength is what we must have. That's why we gathered here today.	2																					
41	41		301								Nikola	Report the results, Asimov.	2																					
42	42		301								Asimov	Yeah, I'll start with the new Construct model.	3																					
43	43		301								Asimov	After finishing the review, I came to the reluctant decision that I'd use Lucia of Gray Raven as the sample in prototype development.	3																					
44	44		301								Nikola	Lucia... is not a stable Construct.	2																					
45	45		301								Asimov	That's exactly what I need. To add to the instability, I even included the data of the Ascendant Alpha.	3																					
46	46		301								Hassen	Are you crazy?	1																					
47	47		301								Asimov	We've all seen what that Ascendant is capable of. If we could tap into their power, it'd make combat easier.	3																					
48	48		301								Nikola	But we can't afford the risk of creating another Alpha.	2																					
49	49		301								Asimov	At least that risk is beyond the scope of consideration in Construct development.	3																					
50	50		301								Hassen	But Lucia is not here, so who's going to test the Construct?	1																					
51	51		301								Asimov	Even if she WAS here, the Construct could not be put to use immediately after being developed, because its memory compatibility has been compromised by Alpha's data. This means if we're not careful...	3																					
52	52		301								Asimov	Anyway, I've prepared a one hundred percent authentic data model. If you try out the Construct within that model, you'll see how powerful it is.	3
