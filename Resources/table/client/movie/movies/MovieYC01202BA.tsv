30	28		301			RImgBg1Shake						After cutting off communications, Vera punts the Corrupted in front at the faraway enemies, and adjusts her posture using this breathing room.																						
31	29		301								Noctis	Asimov, Asimov, Asimov... That lil' cog-head!																						
32	30		301								Noctis	The guy put a restriction lock on my frame, saying that the battery still needs some calibratin' so it can't be used. You serious, man?																						
33	31		301									The three are engaging enemies in different areas of the factory. Vera had Noctis support No. 21 while she faces off against the Corrupted in front of her alone.																						
34	32		301								No. 21	What's a battery?

42	40		301								Vera	Fear... Oh, I would so fear you leaving my reach, dear Roland.	1																					
43	41		301								Roland	And find a giant spear right through my gullet? Didn't think I'd be discovered, though. I thought avoiding the Strike Hawks were enough.	2																					
44	42		301								Roland	And that reckless and lunatic fighting style... You'd fare much better as an Ascendant than a Babylonian. How about it? Want a little squeeze of the Punishing Virus?	2																					
45	43		301								Vera	Well, try offering something else, but becoming an Ascendant? I'll have to decline.	1																					
46	44		301								Roland	Why?	2																					
47	45		301								Vera	Because pain is good. Whether it's my own, or someone else's.	1																					
48	46		301								Vera	And pain, fair Ascendant, is something of a human thing.	1
