4	4		301									For Vera, pain is what makes life, life.																						
5	5		301									—But there is no pain to be found here. To the uninitiated, the quietude of this place might even hint at inner peace.																						
6	6		301									——Which, to Vera, is purgatory—is limbo.																						
7	7		301									In purgatory, the past revives, echoes, replays...																						
8	8		301									—And so, Vera lives through the pain and joy of battle.																						
9	9		301									This is why Vera seeks the battlefield—																						
10	10		301									Dancing on the tightrope between life and death, capering in the euphoria of adrena-sim shots flowing in her vital fluids.																						
11	11		301									Here, Vera finds her peace. Here, Vera lives until her demise.																						
12	12		301									——As such, the imminent quietude drives Vera distraught.																						
13	13		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					To the point where it even reminds her of the conversation with Commander Nikola before she landed in this place.

21	22		301							1		Vera waltzed into Nikola's office and slapped a copy of the mission directive on Nicola's desk.																						
22	23		301									The scattered stack of papers and holo-tapes caused Nikola's old-world mementos to flop off the desk and tumble onto the floor.																						
23	24		301							1	Vera	Care for a kind explanation, Commander Nikola?	2																					
24	25		301								Vera	Cerberus—known for assault and decap strikes—on some silly recon mission in this "water park" thing?	2																					
25	26		301								Nikola	I have no obligations to explain why I assigned you this mission.	1																					
26	27		301								Vera	No, you do.	2																					
27	28		301								Vera	If you don't tell me what you're looking for, I can't guarantee that you'll get what you want.	2																					
28	29		204							2	13																							
29	30		301								Vera	And, please don't forget—I'm only obeying your commands because of your little promise of "giving me pain and suffering enough to drown it all out."	2																					
30	31		301								Vera	So, I need an explanation.	2																					
31	32		301								Nikola	You'll thank me for going on this mission.	1																					
32	33		204							2																								
33	34		301								Vera	That's not an explanation.	2																					
34	35		301								Nikola	...There is something you'd want in this mission, which is why I assigned it to you.	1																					
35	36		204							1	13																							
36	37		301								Nikola	And of all the hounds I can deploy, only you are capable of perfectly accomplishing my orders.	1

38	39		301								Nikola	Track down a person called Shome. I'll tell you when it's time to act.	1																					
39	40		301								Vera	That's still hardly an explanation.	2																					
40	41		301								Nikola	You can expect an explanation all you want, but I am not obligated to answer.	1																					
41	42		301								Nikola	All I can say is that if you're looking for battle, you'll find it there.	1

56	56		301								No. 21	Noctis, you suck at shutting up.																						
57	57		301								Noctis	I'm just do-ing mah job here.

61	61		301								Noctis	That stinky Roland messed their pace up a lil', then Kamui fell, but now they seem to have found themselves some new helpers.																						
62	62		301								Noctis	Anyway, now they've split up. One new guy went underground and the others went inside the park.
