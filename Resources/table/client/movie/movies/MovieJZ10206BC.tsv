3	2		301			DialogEnable						After several days, the sky had begun to rain heavily.																						
4	3		301									Behind the ruins Lucia's hiding in, the sound of Roland's footsteps reverberated.																						
5	4		301									This time Roland was not as relaxed as before.																						
6	5		301									All the fighting, escaping, and hiding has worn out Lucia's frame, its colors having worn away.																						
7	6		301									And the days of fighting also left marks on Roland, as he looked a little weary under the rain.																						
8	7		301								Roland	I'm... tired of this...																						
9	8		301								Lucia	He has made it here...																						
10	9		301								Roland	Lucia! I know you're here, stop hiding.																						
11	10		301									Lucia bore the pain and held the weapon in her mouth. She then used her left hand to pull a strip of cloth from her uniform and tied the weapon to her right hand.																						
12	11		301									As the uniform was torn apart, a string of Constructs' nameplates fell from Lucia's arms.																						
13	12		301									Lucia closed her eyes slowly. She then slightly lifted her head and picked up the nameplates before hanging them around her neck.																						
14	13		301									After finishing all this, Lucia leaned against the wall, stood up slowly, then waited quietly for the opportunity to come.																						
15	14		301									In the distant ruins of buildings, Gabriel held a dark umbrella to keep Luna off the rain. Luna gazed thoughtfully at the street where Roland and Lucia were.																						
16	15		301								Luna	(It's been a week, and we still haven't managed to control Lucia.)																						
17	16		301								Luna	(It would be much easier if we didn't rush to use the Ascendant's ability on her...)																						
18	17		301								Luna	(But during this period of time... Lucia and I have seen each other many times. If she's just confused...)																						
19	18		301								Luna	(Or perhaps she was never confused... Instead, her hatred for the Punishing Virus has overtaken that of...)																						
20	19		301									Luna suddenly looked up as something came to her mind and went in the opposite direction from Roland and Lucia. Gabriel tried to keep up but was stopped by her.																						
21	20		301								Luna	I have to leave for a while to find something. Gabriel, you stay here and make sure Roland won't get out of control and destroy his and sister's frame.																						
22	21		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Gabriel	Roger.

24	23		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After some searching, Roland pinpoints Lucia's location. He now moves cautiously toward her.																						
25	24		201							1	500008																							
26	25		301							1	Roland	Hey, how's that dirty corner treating you?	1																					
27	26		201							1	500099																							
28	27		301							1	Lucia	!	1																					
29	28		202							1					1																			
30	29		301									When Roland came to a dead-end, Lucia jumped out from behind and slashed at Roland's neck.																						
31	30		301									But it only hit on Roland's chain blade, as Roland was clearly on guard and foresaw Lucia's attack.																						
32	31		201							1	500008																							
33	32		301							1	Roland	So close.	1																					
34	33		301								Roland	It's a pity that you didn't take your chance. It's my turn then.	1																					
35	34		202							1					1																			
36	35		301									Roland flips his chain blade and discharges Lucia's weapon to the ground. Then he dashes against Lucia with all his power and sends her flying onto the street.																						
37	36		201							1	500099																							
38	37		301							1	Lucia	Um...	1																					
39	38		202							1					1																			
40	39		301									Roland bends over and gasps for breath. He then raises his gun and limps toward Lucia lying in the street.																						
41	40		201							1	500008																							
42	41		301							1	Roland	Finally!	1																					
43	42		301								Roland	You can't hide anymore...	1																					
44	43		202							1					1																			
45	44		301									After being knocked down, Lucia still tries to stand up by leaning on her weapon. But Roland's gun is already pointing at her head.																						
46	45		201							1	500099																							
47	46		301							1	Lucia	...	1																					
48	47		201							1	500008																							
49	48		301							1	Roland	Don't move, otherwise, you'll lose more than your leg.	1																					
50	49		201							1	500099																							
51	50		301							1	Lucia	Argh!	1																					
52	51		202							1					1																			
53	52		301									Lucia swings her weapon with all her might.This sudden attack makes Roland stagger backward to stabilize himself.																						
54	53		301									Before Roland could press forward again, Lucia had raised her weapon to her own heart.																						
55	54		201							1	500008	4																						
56	55		301							1	Roland	What?!	1																					
57	56		202							1					1																			
58	57		301									Roland had never imagined Lucia to do this.																						
59	58		201							1	500105																							
60	59		301							1	Luna	Lucia!	1																					
61	60		202							1					1																			
62	61		301									At the moment the blade touched her frame, Lucia was interrupted by a sudden sound from a distance.																						
63	62		201							1	500099																							
64	63		301							1	Lucia	...	1																					
65	64		202							1					1																			
66	65		301									As Lucia looked back, she saw Luna approaching slowly from the other side of the street.																						
67	66		301									Rain pours down on Luna, but her determination and pride will never be washed away.																						
68	67		301									Her determination, however, is accompanied by a crushing agony on her face.																						
69	68		201							1	500105																							
70	69		301							1	Luna	It's much easier to die than to live in hell...	1																					
71	70		301								Luna	But we promised to keep on living together...	1																					
72	71		301								Luna	The little sister who followed you around and couldn't live without you.	1																					
73	72		301								Luna	Is alive and standing right in front of you.	1																					
74	73		301								Luna	And now you're going to leave me?	1																					
75	500		202							1					1																			
76	74		301									Luna took out an old doll hidden behind her back.																						
77	75		201							1	500047																							
78	76		301							1		It's a frog doll.	1																					
79	77		201							1	500105																							
80	78		301							1	Luna	But this is not the original one. I only found this in the ruins nearby.	1																					
81	79		301								Luna	Because... I left the original one to you... my sister...	1																					
82	80		301								Luna	Is that doll...	1																					
83	81		204							1	13																							
84	82		301								Luna	Still here?	1																					
85	83		202							1					1																			
86	84		301									Lucia holds her position, with tears running down her face.																						
87	85		301									Luna's words remind her of the church from her childhood days, the little girl, and her powerless self.																						
88	86		301									Two figures approach from the other end of the street. As they come closer, the blurred image of the girl become more and more clear in Lucia's eyes.																						
89	87		201							1	500031																							
90	88		301							1	Luna	Lucia, when can I go out with you?	1																					
91	89		203							1	0.25	-450																						
92	90		201							2	500032		450																					
93	91		301							1	Lucia	...You can't go out yet. It's too dangerous outside.	2																					
94	92		301								Luna	But you were always the one to protect me... And I want to protect you this time... or help, at least...	1																					
95	93		301								Lucia	I promised Mother and Father that I would never let anyone hurt you. So, I'll handle the riskier parts...	2																					
96	94		202							2					1																			
97	95		203							1	0.25																							
98	96		301								Luna	When I grow up, I'm leaving home and keeping you safe!	1																					
99	97		202							1					1																			
100	98		301									The young Lucia reached out her left hand to Luna, but she could touch nothing. The illusion of those two little girls then walked past Lucia and Luna in the present and disappeared in the blink of an eye.																						
101	99		201							1	500099	14																						
102	100		301							1	Lucia	Luna...	1																					
103	101		202							1					1																			
104	102		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Luna comes to Lucia. She holds Lucia's face in one hand and, with the other hand, gently brushes off the hilt of Lucia's blade in her hand.																						
105	103		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cgqz114.jpg																								
106	104		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Luna	Lucia... Sis...																						
107	105		301								Lucia	Lu...

109	107		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cgqz113.jpg																								
110	108		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Lucia almost collapsed into Luna's arms. Tears ran down her cheeks.																						
111	109		301								Lucia	Ah!																						
112	110		301									Lucia's cry was heart-wrenching.																						
113	111		301									Fume, battlefield, human, the virus, survival, salvation, trust, betrayal, despair, hope...																						
114	112		301									At that moment, Lucia could finally let go of all the heavy burdens...																						
115	113		301									...As a normal teenage girl, and have a good cry.																						
116	114		301									Gabriel and Roland stood aside in silence.																						
117	115		301									The rain is still coming down furiously, muffling all sounds.																						
118	116		301								Luna	I can protect you now, Lucia...																						
119	117		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Luna	So, starting from today... let's be yourself...
