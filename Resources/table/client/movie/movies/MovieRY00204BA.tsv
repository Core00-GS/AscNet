5	5		301									Nanami has been sulking since she returned from the virtual space. She lies on a recliner in the Gray Raven lounge, bored and aimless.																						
6	6		204							1																								
7	7		301								Nanami	The Gray Ravens and Commandant are still not back... Waiting here is so boring...	1

12	12		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						That said, Nanami has no idea where the roads in Babylonia lead, not to mention that she has no clue where her destination is. She is practically wandering.																						
13	13		301									As she roams the streets, she ends up on a platform that resembles a square, with quite a lot of people gathered there.																						
14	14		201							1	500091	1																						
15	15		301							1	Nanami	It's so lively here! Look at all these people!	1																					
16	16		301								Nanami	I wonder if there's a gathering going on?	1																					
17	17		202							1					1																			
18	18		301									Nanami leans lazily on the fences of the balcony like a cat, watching the crowds walking by with enthusiasm.																						
19	19		301									Time passes slowly. No one here knows of Nanami's true identity, and so she gets to enjoy her time with the humans like a normal little girl.																						
20	20		301								???	Miss... Miss!																						
21	21		301									Not until she hears someone calling for her that the spaced-out Nanami turns around to find a human child she does not know tugging the corner of her clothes.																						
22	22		201							1	500091																							
23	23		301							1	Nanami	...Miss? Are you calling Nanami?	1																					
24	24		301								Boy	Is your name Nanami, Miss?																						
25	25		204							1	1																							
26	26		301								Nanami	That's right! Nanami's name is indeed Nanami!	1																					
27	27		301								Boy	That's such a weird name...																						
28	28		301								Nanami	Not at all! Nanami really likes her name, you know?	1																					
29	29		301								Boy	Whatever, I don't mind. Nanami, can you give me a hand?																						
30	30		301								Nanami	Of course! The almighty Nanami is all-capable!	1																					
31	31		301								Boy	Then please help me find V!																						
32	32		301								Nanami	V? What is that...? Oh, I know, is that your mom?	1																					
33	33		301								Boy	Who would have a mom named V? No, V is my parrot, but it's flown up to the tree, and it won't come down...																						
34	34		301									Nanami's eyes follow where the boy is pointing and finds a parrot perching on a tall bionic tree, tilting its head and staring at them.																						
35	35		301								Boy	It normally behaves very well, but it just wouldn't answer me today. Does it hate me?																						
36	36		301								Nanami	Hmm, Nanami thinks that V is just frightened by all these people here.	1																					
37	37		301								Boy	Then what should we do...																						
38	38		204							1	1																							
39	39		301								Nanami	Let me seeeeee... This bionic tree should be able to support Nanami's weight... Alright, I'm going to climb up there and bring it back!	1																					
40	40		202							1					1																			
41	41		301									Although the bionic tree is not very strong and Nanami's feet still have wheels attached to them, she still manages to dextrously climb to the top, stepping on the branches on her way up.																						
42	42		201							1	500091	1																						
43	43		301							1	Nanami	Heave-ho... Nanami's up! Don't be scared, V! I'm here to help you down!	1																					
44	44		301									But the branch V is perching on is way too thin for Nanami to cross. Luckily, the little boy below comes up with an idea.																						
45	45		301								Boy	Miss Nanami, how about reaching from the branch there?																						
46	46		301								Nanami	Oh, I see it! Here comes Nanami... Aah!	1																					
47	47		202							1					1																			
48	48		301			RImgBg1Shake						Just as she steps onto that branch, Nanami finds nothing below her foot. She loses balance and falls from the tree... and lands steadily on her feet with her frame's adaptive maneuverability.																						
49	49		201							1	500091	1																						
50	50		301							1	Nanami	A perfect landing from Nanami! Ten out of ten!	1																					
51	51		301								Nanami	But that's so weird... Why was there nothing where I stepped? Hold on, where is V?	1																					
52	52		202							1					1																			
53	53		301									Nanami looks up immediately and sees the parrot circling above the tree before flying down and landing on the boy's arm.																						
54	54		301								Boy	Hahaha! We did it, V! We tricked Miss Nanami!																						
55	55		301								"V"	We—tricked—Miss! Chirp! We—tricked—Miss!																						
56	56		201							1	500091																							
57	57		301							1	Nanami	What?! So you were lying when you said V wouldn't come down!	1																					
58	58		301									That is when Nanami realizes that the "branch" she was stepping on is merely a high resolution holographic projection. No wonder she would fall.																						
59	59		301								Boy	I bet you didn't notice that V is a bionic mechanoid bird! This is an April Fools prank that only we can pull off!																						
60	60		301								"V"	We—did—it! Chirp! We—did—it!																						
61	61		301									A bionic mechanoid cannot disobey its owner's directives even with its own AI system. Naturally, it cannot "misbehave."																						
62	62		201							1	500091	1																						
63	63		301							1	Nanami	(Chuckles) I see...	1																					
64	64		301									Except Nanami has known that V is not a real bird all along. In her eyes, mechanical and organic lives are one and the same.																						
65	65		301								Boy	But today's April Fool's Day, so you can't be mad, Miss!																						
66	66		301								Nanami	Nanami is a mature grownup—I wouldn't be angry just because of a kid's prank. But someone else might be...	1																					
67	67		202							1					1																			
68	68		301								???	You little rascal! I looked away for a second and you ran away!																						
69	69		301									A loud, furious voice comes out from below the balcony, and Nanami sees a woman running up the stairs, panting.																						
70	70		301								Boy	Aargh, it's Mom! V, we've gotta bolt!																						
71	71		301								"V"	Gotta! Bolt! Chirp!																						
72	72		301									But the boy turns to find Nanami standing in his way, smirking with ill intent.																						
73	73		201							1	500091	1																						
74	74		301							1	Nanami	No, Nanami is not angry... but Nanami loves to help mothers find their lost children.	1																					
75	75		202							1					1																			
76	76		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Boy	I knew you'd be mad about this!																						
77	77		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After learning that her son has pulled a prank on Nanami, the young mother immediately drags the boy over and apologizes to her.																						
78	78		301								Young Mother	I'm so terribly sorry... That was so terribly inappropriate... You! Apologize to the nice lady here at once!																						
79	79		301								Boy	Tch, it's April Fool's Day... What's the big deal...																						
80	80		301									The way his mother scowls stops him from continuing his rant.																						
81	81		301								Young Mother	No matter what, you should never take advantage of other people's kindness! Do you hear me?																						
82	82		301								Young Mother	And if you keep lying to others, no one will believe you again when you tell the truth!																						
83	83		301								Boy	U-understood...																						
84	84		301									The boy apologizes to Nanami and then departs while holding his mother's hand, leaving Nanami by herself, leaning on the fences, watching the people go by.																						
85	85		201							1	500091																							
86	86		301							1	Nanami	Nanami also took advantage of Karenina's kindness... No wonder she was so mad at me. Not just Karey deary—Nanami also tricked many others today.	1																					
87	87		301								Nanami	Mmm... Should Nanami go to apologize to each of them? Not to mention...	1																					
88	88		301									Nanami looks at the young mother and the boy walking through the square hand in hand, the boy waving at her as he sees her from afar.																						
89	89		301									Nanami takes out a synthetic candy, a gift from the boy earlier, as an apology. It is not very expensive, but it comes in a wrapper that is as beautiful as the starry night sky.																						
90	90		301								Nanami	If I leave the bug in Gestalt alone, it's going to affect these people's lives here somehow...	1																					
91	91		301									She unwraps the candy and tosses it in her mouth—not very sweet, but pleasant enough, she thinks. Nanami holds the translucent wrapper up, and through it, she finds Babylonia and her people coated in beautiful colors.																						
92	92		204							1	1																							
93	93		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Nanami	After all... Nanami really loves humans.	1
