6	6		301							1	Lustrous	I thought there would be more opposition.	1																					
7	7		301									Lustrous looks slightly surprised.																						
8	8		301									The administrative director closes the metallic clasp of the suitcase and smiles at the research director.																						
9	9		301								Admin Director	My hands would be on your neck if I was still the same person from when I first came here.	2																					
10	10		301								Admin Director	Remember the first night you became the director? I dragged you out from your lab and hosted a dinner with the other directors.	2																					
11	11		301								Admin Director	I asked you what you think of the base when we were eating. You said this place is like a brain constantly metabolizing.	2																					
12	12		301								Lustrous	I did say that.	1																					
13	13		301								Admin Director	It was a good metaphor.	2																					
14	14		301								Admin Director	Does it matter what carbon dioxide and the sodium think when they're created from metabolism?	2																					
15	15		301									Lustrous does not hesitate.																						
16	16		301								Lustrous	Not at all. The only thing that matters is the thought.	1																					
17	17		301								Admin Director	That's why the nutrients go to your part of the brain. Do what you have to do.	2

27	27		301							1	Lustrous	I'm glad to have you as my colleagues. It's an honor working with you all.	1																					
28	28		301								Admin Director	The honor is mine. I look forward to Atlantis leading the next Industrial Revolution, but if I won't live long enough for that day to come, I'll die where it sits.	2																					
29	29		202							1	2				1

32	32		301							1	Admin Director	I'll "go" first. Try to stay away as long as you can.	1

36	36		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Lustrous stands in front of the window of the observatory, looking out at the lifeless seaborne city.																						
37	37		301									The more one thing has shone, the more forsaken it looks when it falls.																						
38	38		301									Too long has passed. Everyone she knows has passed. Now, standing here alone, she looks like a wavering torch in a storm.																						
39	39		301									And this last torch is about to go out.																						
40	40		301									The weather is not great today. Dark clouds cover the sky, but the rain has yet to fall. Literal silver linings are peeking from between the clouds.																						
41	41		301								Lustrous	...																						
42	42		301									She closes her eyes, trying to feel the warmth on her cheeks.																						
43	43		301								Lustrous	So in the end, I still have that speck of weakness in me...																						
44	44		301								Lustrous	Oh, brain, I despise you sometimes.																						
45	45		301									Lustrous sighs softly.																						
46	46		301									She has never shown any weakness in front of others because she was their flag.																						
47	47		301									A flag is a symbol and a metaphor. A flag does not need to show humanity or have a heart. A flag just needs to be hung before an army during wars and planted on the enemy's castle after victory.																						
48	48		301									As long as the flag does not fall, everyone else will charge toward the same destination. As long as it stands, everyone will march forward fearlessly for their dreams and beliefs.																						
49	49		301									But now, everyone she was leading is gone. They have burnt their dignity and soul into cinders for their last act for humanity.																						
50	50		301									And so, the flag becomes a human again.																						
51	52		301								Lustrous	Try to stay away as long as I can...?																						
52	53		301								Lustrous	I'm afraid I can't keep that promise.																						
53	54		301									The observatory used to be where they liked to stay the most.																						
54	55		301									It sits at the top of Atlantis, and they could see the whole city from here. They could see the ocean, the sky, the stars.																						
55	56		301									The observatory is empty now. She is the only one left, trying to see humanity's future.																						
56	57		301									Lustrous walks to her chair and sits down.																						
57	58		301									She has done her job. This is as far as she goes.																						
58	59		301									She is tired.																						
59	60		301									She will leave the rest of the work to those who come after.																						
60	61		301									Lustrous turns around and takes one last look at the setting sun.																						
61	62		301									Just one regret—she thinks.																						
62	63		301									The day she set foot on this island, she thought she would go to the edge of the universe one day.																						
63	64		301								Lustrous	Who would have thought that, in the end, I'd go gentle into that good night?																						
64	65		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Her last whisper is carried away by the wind, disappearing with the last hint of sunlight.

66	67		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The moment you open the door to the observatory, you feel like you have just pressed the play button on a snapshot of the past.																						
67	68		301									As the sea breeze rushes in, the room begins to fog up.																						
68	69		301									The woman you have seen in the videos is sitting quietly on a chair not far from you.																						
69	70		301									Her body does not look rotten. It has dried thoroughly under the same clothes you have seen in the records, easily identifiable.																						
70	71		301									A heavy sense of sadness suddenly brews and fills the room.																						
71	73		301									Silently, Vera walks toward the woman and kneels down on one knee.																						
72	74		301									And then she discovers something.																						
73	75		301									The supply crate next to the body is filled with food.																						
74	77		301								Vera	...																						
75	78		301									Vera's eyes widen.																						
76	80		301								Vera	Haha—hahaha—																						
77	81		301									For a moment there, she can even picture the woman's last moment from what has been left behind in the room.																						
78	82		301									Unlike the others, Lustrous was not starved to death. She chose to end her life.																						
79	83		301									Realizing that, Vera laughs hysterically as if to cover another feeling deep inside.																						
80	84		301								Vera	This is "as far as she goes"... Then what the hell is this?																						
81	85		301								Vera	You tricky bastard. In the end, you couldn't take it.																						
82	86		401							1	206																							
83	87		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Vera	Well, then. I'll seize it from you—

86	90		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Vera opens a pack of hardtacks and stuffs them in her mouth.																						
87	91		301									Constructs do not need to eat. What she is doing is technically pointless.																						
88	92		301									But Vera just starts stuffing the hardtacks into her mouth one after another like a ritual where she is picking up the baton.																						
89	97		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					A flag being passed from Lustrous to Vera.

93	102		301								Vera	I will.	1																					
94	103		301								Vera	I will take your dreams, your future, your desires to live, your lost pain... I will take it all.	1																					
95	104		301									She stands up, reaches inside Lustrous' coat, and takes out their "legacy."																						
96	105		301									She gives it to you.																						
97	106		302								Vera...	107	I'll keep it safe.	107																				
98	107		301									She nods.																						
99	108		301								Vera	Stay here. I'm going spearfishing.	1																					
100	109		301								Vera	Who knows how many things here are of use? I don't want Nikola nagging me for not trying to stop it from sinking.	1
