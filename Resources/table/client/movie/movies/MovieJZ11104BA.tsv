4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Andre	Alright, you lot! The time has come! Inspection of the outside of the train! I want every one of you who're going out to check if their buckles are secured!	1																					
5	5		301								Andre	The people in the noble carriage told us that they saw there's skin damage at the back of the train from their verandas, so remember to bring your welding tools and skin patches!	1

7	7		301									Thus is the start of a new day for the inspection team... Or should I say, just another day for them.																						
8	8		301									Everyone knows it as an order from the aristocrats, and that they have no right to refuse or negotiate.																						
9	9		301									All they can do is to make sure they're buckled up and check their outdated tools once more.																						
10	10		301								Aristocrat	Slackers! Why aren't you working yet?! Scram!

15	15		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						It should've been a normal inspection.																						
16	16		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Two teams deployed, find the damaged area, cut off the parts sticking out, paste on the patch, and then weld it. A simple out-and-in operation.

18	18		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Inspection Team Member	Boss, section A inspection done, no damages found.																						
19	19		201							1	500139																							
20	20		301							1	Andre	This is Andre, I copy. You guys stay where you are. Vanguards follow me, while rearguards use the planar sonar for inspection once more.	1

23	23		301							1	Sophia	Rearguards copy. The scan will be finished in 5 minutes, we will then proceed to follow at a 50m distance.	2																					
24	24		301								Andre	Sophia.	1																					
25	25		301								Sophia	Yes?	2																					
26	26		301								Andre	Advance with your team in 20 minutes.	1																					
27	27		301								Sophia	But why? Even if we count in the time to pack up the sonar, it'll only take around 7 minutes...	2																					
28	28		301								Andre	I have a bad feeling about today, so it's best to take things slowly.	1																					
29	29		301								Sophia	...The weather's great and the visibility is good, I don't understand.	2																					
30	30		301								Andre	Yes, great weather and good visibility with moderate wind speed.	1																					
31	31		301								Andre	It would be nice to take a stroll under this weather.	1																					
32	32		301								Andre	Which brings me to this question, why would the skin be damaged in this weather?	1																					
33	33		301								Sophia	It is usually impossible, but there are 4 possibilities for skin damage in this weather.	2																					
34	34		202							1	2				1																			
35	35		301								Inspection Team Member	Boss, this is the section C inspection team, we see the damage!																						
36	36		201							1	500139																							
37	37		301							1	Andre	...This is Andre, copy that. We'll be there in 2 minutes.	1																					
38	38		301								Andre	Those in the back, be careful. Wait a while before advancing.	1																					
39	39		301								Andre	Everyone here is invaluable to me, I'd be sad if we were to lose anyone.	1

41	41		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Sophia	...Good.	1																					
42	42		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Sophia	Boss, this is the rearguards, the planar sonar readings are steady.	1																					
43	43		301								Sophia	...Boss?	1																					
44	44		301								Sophia	...Boss Andre?	1																					
45	45		202							1					1																			
46	46		301								Andre	...

48	48		301							1	Sophia	What's wrong? Signal interference?	1																					
49	49		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Sophia	The weather's fine, so... Unless...	1																					
50	50		202							1					1																			
51	51		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Although Sophia has been through a lot being born into the lower class and has been used to adversity, the scene in front of her eyes is far worse than anything she has encountered.																						
52	52		301									The vanguards were devoured by layers and layers of the Corrupted. She could see Andre in the distance kicking away a Corrupted and trying his best to drag an unconscious Clegg back to the defense line.																						
53	53		301									Without thinking, Sophia breaks through rows and rows of Corrupted together with her team, ready to rescue the vanguards.																						
54	54		201							1	500132																							
55	55		301							1	Sophia	Boss! Quickly!	1																					
56	56		201							1	500139

58	58		202							1					1																			
59	59		301									Before Sophia could react, another wave of Corrupted joins in, entrapping the newcomers.																						
60	60		301									The rearguards had no choice but to move forward and join the vanguards.																						
61	61		201							1	500139																							
62	62		301							1	Andre	If we can't get help, then I'm afraid this will be the end for us...	1																					
63	63		201							1	500132																							
64	64		301							1	Sophia	That leaves us no choice but to fight till the end then.	1
