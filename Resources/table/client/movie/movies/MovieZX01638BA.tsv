132	133		302								...Who is this?	134																						
133	134		301									In your dimming vision, you see a shape, a bad memory jolting like the reflecting lights on stained glass. An intense, instinctual reaction has jogged your recollection of who that is.																						
134	135		302								...Huaxu!	136																						
135	136		301								Huaxu	Commandant 【kuroname】 has discovered my disguise, demonstrating a stable mind after being corrupted for 4 minutes and 32 seconds, suggesting remarkable capabilities in Construct connection and defying corruption.																						
136	137		301								Huaxu	Based on this result, I hypothesize that you are capable of connecting with an Ascendant. Therefore, I propose the following suggestion—																						
137	138		301								Huaxu	Infiltrate Alpha's M.I.N.D. by leveraging your connection with Lucia, who originates from the same source.																						
138	139		302								...Why would I do that?	140	What will it do to Lucia?	140																				
139	140		301								Huaxu	With Alpha in the M.I.N.D., you can buy the other Gray Ravens some time. This will not affect Lucia in any way.																						
140	141		302								...Disable your attack first!	142	You can invade Alpha yourself.	142																				
141	142		301								Huaxu	I cannot disobey the order from a level one user. I can only do what has not been forbidden.																						
142	143		302								...What do you need me to do?	144																						
143	144		301								Huaxu	Stabilize Lucia's M.I.N.D. from Alpha's interference, and give her the same clearance level as Alpha, so that she can enter her own Deep M.I.N.D.																						
144	145		301								Huaxu	At this stage, only two people with the same clearance and origin could synchronize.																						
145	146		302								How does it benefit you if Alpha fails?	147																						
146	147		301								Huaxu	I will not be destroyed by the Ascendant Alpha.																						
147	148		302								That's it?	149																						
148	149		301								Huaxu	The remaining information is classified.																						
149	150		301								Huaxu	To encourage an agreement, I can inform you of a helpful piece of detail.																						
150	151		301								Huaxu	Based on the result of the simulation, any decision other than cooperation will lead to Gray Raven's demise.																						
151	152		302								I believe Lucia will win.	153	This is the only way.	155																				
152	153		301								Huaxu	【kuroname】, you have not considered the challenges posed by the environment and reinforcement.																						
153	154		302								...Seems like this is the only way.	155																						
154	155		301								Huaxu	Agreement reached. I recommend staying awake, Commandant.

239	240		301								Huaxu	Based on the maximum stability possible for a Mind Beacon, this human should have gone psychotic a long time ago. This is an unexplainable phenomenon. I will require time to analyze this error.																						
240	241		301								Huaxu	However, it is my belief that the priority of the entity Alpha lies elsewhere.																						
241	242		301								Huaxu	The target is transmitting access to the Deep M.I.N.D., the recipient being... Lucia.

244	245		301									To Alpha, transmitting access during a fight and allowing Lucia to remember her past are both a sure path to Gray Raven's defeat.
