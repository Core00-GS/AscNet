3	3		304							You don't know how elated I was to receive a reply from you.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
4	4		304							It's been no more than two days since I first sent the letter. Babylonia really is small, isn't it?	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
5	5		304							But just the wait itself made me realize why people in the olden days used to be so fond of communicating through letters.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
6	6		304							The act of waiting heightens emotions, akin to watching fruit ripen. It fills one with anxiety and expectations.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
7	7		304							Perhaps it's not highly efficient, but it's worth the wait.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
8	8		304							I'd like to once again formally introduce myself. My pen name is "Iris".	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
9	9		304							And I'm emphasizing my name for the second time because I'd like to share with you the meaning behind this name, 	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
10	10		304							something I didn't do in my first letter.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
11	11		304							I chanced upon this beautiful name while reading The Tempest. You may have heard of this opera, but in any case,	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1

14	14		301			AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin					Then there was a series of beautiful transcriptions. The person who wrote this letter even changed the color of ink to write this poetic text.																						
15	15		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				Ceres, the goddess of fertility, I am the rainbow in the sky, and I am the envoy of the Queen of Heaven;	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
16	16		304							The Queen of Heaven, in the clouds, sent a message to ask you to leave your supple field where wheat, barley, rye, oats, wild beans and peas flourish;	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
17	17		304							Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep, and flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
18	18		304							Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims, which spongy April at thy hest betrims;	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
19	19		304							To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom-groves;	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
20	20		304							Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves;	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
21	21		304							Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard; And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard, where thou thyself dost air;	000000ff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1

25	25		301			AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin					Writing here now, even the pen tip and pressure have become more "soft".																						
26	26		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				These are lines from The Tempest. Iris is the goddess of the rainbow and the emissary of the gods.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
27	27		304							The rainbow bridges Heaven and Earth. It conveys people's joys and sorrows to the gods and spreads their gospel to the world.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
28	28		304							I'm fascinated both by the things that Iris symbolizes, as well as by the stanza itself.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
29	29		304							I've never seen the things it mentions, so I keep fantasizing about them and imagining what they're like.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
30	30		304				AniZhuanchangBegin			If their names are already so perfect, imagine how beautiful they would be in real life.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1			1																
31	31		301			AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin					Suddenly, with a turn of the pen—																						
32	32		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				My apologies, I'm rambling on and on about my interests again.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
33	33		304							This has always been a bad habit of mine, or at least, that's what my parents often say.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
34	34		304							I just want to share what I lost most with you.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
35	35		304							I love operas. I love the stuff that exists only in stories and in imagination.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1

49	49		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You have been writing with a pen pal named Iris for some time.																						
50	50		301									Relying on the fragmentary information between the lines, you slowly piecs together the overall image of her.																						
51	51		301									She likes art, music, literature, opera, instrumental performance, and singing.																						
52	52		301									In a time like this, when the Punishing Virus has taken away everything, the act of loving these things is an extravagance in and of itself.																						
53	53		301									She is an innocent little girl who has never experienced any setbacks in life. She does not have to worry about anything other than herself. Only a greenhouse free of any contaminants would be able to produce such innocence.																						
54	54		301									A flower of Eden that knows nothing of the real world.																						
55	55		301									She lives in a perfect world, so even if you do not see things her way, you would not want to destroy the perfection she lives in.																						
56	56		301									And you cannot avoid slowly opening up about your life as you send letters back and forth.																						
57	57		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You have started asking and answering each other's questions in those letters.																						
58	58		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				In your last letter, you mentioned the words like F.O.S. Later, I went back to learn more about it.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
59	59		304							With all due respect, 【kuroname】, were you a student at F.O.S. Military Command College? Are you a soldier?	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
60	60		304							Your writing is very special, sharp, beautiful and full of power, that's why I have this speculation.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
61	61		304							As your writing suggests, you certainly have a strong will.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
62	62		304							I hope to become just like you, so resolute and determined.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
63	63		304							Let's talk about me then. I don't have my life planned out.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
64	64		304							But it's said that on turning 18, every resident of Eden will be allocated a suitable job by Gestalt.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
65	65		304							I've been thinking about what kind of person I want to become.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
66	66		304							If I do nothing and go along with Gestalt's affinity and suitability matching data, letting it determine my future, my life would probably be very dull.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
67	67		304							As mentioned previously, I love operas.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
68	68		304							Using the libretto and music to convey your inner world to others... I feel that it's an especially meaningful endeavor.	0000ffff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1
