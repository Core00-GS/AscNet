16	16		301									The research does not stop for anyone. To Atlantis, the zero-point reactor is bigger than the world.																						
17	17		301									Anyone who cannot advance the research will be shipped back to the mainland, living the rest of their lives monitored. And in a few hours, those vacancies will be filled.

30	30		301									Equations written years ago still linger on the yellow-tinted whiteboards. Dried ink turns to dust with the slightest touch, flaking off from the boards.																						
31	31		301									The empty offices are tidy and organized as if waiting for the departed researchers to return and work. A thick layer of dust on the tables and the floor suggests that it has been a long time since someone last visited.																						
32	32		301									There is but the slightest rustling of air in the ventilation ducts. Inside the data center, servers grow on the clean, smooth floor like cubic trees, unaware of the time that has passed.																						
33	33		301									Only the red, low-wattage emergency lights are on. Dimly-lit yellow arrows point at the evacuation route at the crossroads. There are no footprints—everyone in the city vanished in one night like Pompeii.

45	45		201							1	500345	4

48	48		301									The dark corridor extends forward, unending.																						
49	49		301									You look back at where Vera and you came from.																						
50	50		301									You have left behind two sets of clear footprints as if trekking through dark brown snow.																						
51	51		302								Footprints. Only our footprints are here.	52																						
52	52		301									The prints are fairly level, meaning the thickness of the dust is similarly even...																						
53	53		301									With that, you can infer that the city has not been disrupted since it was abandoned.																						
54	54		301									—No one has visited here, which is how the dust could pile up evenly.																						
55	55		201							1	500345	2																						
56	56		301							1	Vera	Hmm, I might be a little bit impressed right now.	1																					
57	57		302								The emergency lights are still on.	58																						
58	58		301									Which means emergency power and the electric circuits are still intact.																						
59	59		301									The other facilities are likely functional as well.																						
60	60		204							1	4																							
61	61		301								Vera	...That doesn't make sense.	1																					
62	62		302								This place is way too "clean."	63																						
63	63		301									"Clean," not in the sense that it is tidy and spotless, but that there is no evidence of this place having been infected by the Punishing Virus.																						
64	64		301									The dust and facilities would have been disrupted if Corrupted have invaded here.																						
65	65		302								One more thing...	66																						
66	66		301								Vera	One more thing indeed. There is no one here.	1																					
67	67		301									She has not spelled it out, but you understand that what she meant was there are no corpses here.																						
68	68		301								Vera	What the hell happened to everybody?	1																					
69	69		301								Vera	Did they all evacuate before the shit hit the fan?	1																					
70	70		301									She mutters to herself.																						
71	71		301									There would not have been supplies after the outbreak.																						
72	72		302								I think so.	73	I don't think so.	78																				
73	73		301						2000			Vera purses, considering.																						
74	74		301								Vera	Ha, that's what I think. No supplies would be delivered here after the outbreak.	1																					
75	75		301								Vera	This kind of city wasn't designed to be self-sustaining from the beginning. Once the food was gone, the people would have left.	1																					
76	76		301						2000			She falls silent again.																						
77	77	81	301								Vera	That doesn't make sense either... If they did leave, then the world would have known about this place.	1																					
78	78		301						2000			Vera falls silent.																						
79	79		301									You do not elaborate.																						
80	80		301									This kind of city was not designed to be self-sustaining from the beginning. If they had stayed here, they would have run out of food eventually.																						
81	81		301									Neither of you is willing to continue this conversation. You have both realized that the truth might be too brutal for you.																						
82	82		401							2	561																							
83	83		301									Silence returns between you. But it does not last as Vera draws her spear and destroys a large door nearby.																						
84	84		302								What are you doing?	85																						
85	85		204							1	13																							
86	86		301								Vera	Getting their attention, duh.	1																					
87	87		301								Vera	There must be a large number of mechanoids and drones here to support a city this big.	1																					
88	88		301								Vera	If the Punishing Virus had reached this place, then there must be Corrupted here.	1																					
89	89		301								Vera	But all the Corrupted we encountered on our way here are "outsiders" arriving with the water.	1																					
90	90		301								Vera	Maybe that was because we were on the outskirts of the city.	1																					
91	91		301								Vera	Yet, there are still no signs of corpses, battles, or Corrupted here, deep inside.	1																					
92	92		301				DialogDisable				Vera	If they have been hiding, now's the time to get them out here.	1																					
93	93		302								You would expose our location.	94																						
94	94		302								We might get surrounded.	95																						
95	95		301			DialogEnable					Vera	That's what a commandant would think.	1																					
96	96		301								Vera	Not me.	1																					
97	97		301								Vera	Be honest with me, what is it that you sense the most strongly since you set foot here?	1																					
98	98		302								...	99	Fear.	100																				
99	99	101	301								Vera	Do you know that sometimes your expression reveals everything even when you don't answer?	1																					
100	100		301								Vera	Good. Honesty is a warrior's virtue. Fear, on the other hand, is a warrior's lifeline.	1																					
101	101		301								Vera	You're scared, but have you considered what you're scared of?	1																					
102	102		302								The unknown.	103																						
103	103		301								Vera	Fear of the unknown is the greatest fear of all. Once the enemies reveal themselves, that fear will go away.	1																					
104	104		301								Vera	Instead of blundering around here blindly like a fly caught on a web, I'd rather hit the web, piss off the spider, and have it come to me.	1																					
105	105		302								I understand.	106																						
106	106		301								Vera	It's fine if you don't. I'm not asking for your opinion.	1																					
107	107		302								But your plan...	108																						
108	108		301									It does not seem to work.																						
109	109		301									It has been some time since Vera caused the commotion. You even chatted for a while, and the place is still eerily quiet. The broken door to the office looks like a scab under the red emergency light.																						
110	110		204							1	4																							
111	111		301								Vera	Tsk.	1																					
112	112		301									She turns toward the room next to her—the office of which she destroyed the door.

122	122		301									These all point to one thing.																						
123	123		301									Not only was this city not infected after the Punishing Virus broke out, but it also remained operational for a period of time.																						
124	124		201							1	500345																							
125	125		301							1	Vera	Did they take all the food to their hideouts? If so... where is the last place they stayed?	1

127	127		301									Vera asks the two questions that have been bothering you since you have been here.																						
128	128		301									You walk toward the largest desk in the office.																						
129	129		301									The name plate on it spells out its owner's name.																						
130	130		301									—Research Director: Lustrous.																						
131	131		201							1	500345																							
132	132		301							1	Vera	What a strange name.	1

150	150		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Lustrous	Twice have we disconnected with the mainland during the routine call. The communication director suggested breaking the confidential mandate and contacting them instead. I approved it.	1																					
151	151		301								Lustrous	But there was no response. The communication director then suggested calibrating the comms to use the public frequency so we can receive news from the outside world.	1																					
152	152		301								Lustrous	Again, that'd go against the confidentiality mandate. But I still approved it.	1																					
153	153		301								Lustrous	I'm glad that decision was not too late. The channels that still worked were all reporting the same warning: the Punishing Virus.	1																					
154	154		301								Lustrous	They claimed that it was a virus that appeared in the first zero-point reactor initially and spread to the whole world in an extremely short amount of time.	1																					
155	155		301								Lustrous	The comms devices on the unresponsive channels are probably infected already.	1																					
156	156		301								Lustrous	Atlantis was submerged during the beginning of the outbreak, so we didn't receive the news immediately. At the same time, that seemed to be why we escaped its wrath.	1																					
157	157		301								Lustrous	While we still don't understand what the Punishing Virus is, we have decided to designate it as our highest priority, given the feedback we received.	1																					
158	158		301								Lustrous	Based on what we know, we believe the Punishing Virus can infect a human body directly, and it is capable of taking over a mechanoid's mind.	1																					
159	159		301								Lustrous	In which case, our base is in incredible danger as well. Therefore, our most urgent mission is to stop Atlantis from getting infected by the Punishing Virus.	1																					
160	160		301								Lustrous	The logistics director reported that the next supply ship from the mainland would arrive soon. We tried to contact it when we saw it on the horizon, but instead of answering us through radio, they sent a signal flare.	1																					
161	161		301								Lustrous	I didn't understand what it meant. The logistics director said it was asking for help.	1																					
162	162		301								Lustrous	I ordered them to sink it. I couldn't risk bringing the virus into Atlantis.	1																					
163	163		301								Lustrous	Four submarines were monitoring the situation underwater outside the base. I ordered them to sink themselves. Two obliged, while the other two tried to crash into the harbor. Our defense system took them down.	1																					
164	164		301								Lustrous	I hosted a brief meeting to hear the directors' reports after taking care of these inconveniences.	1																					
165	165		301								Lustrous	The decision we had to make during the meeting was simple: where does Atlantis go from here?	1																					
166	166		301								Lustrous	Not much effort was needed for us to come to an agreement. There were, however, some disputes when the message was passed down.	1																					
167	167		301								Lustrous	Someone proposed that we should broadcast to nearby areas and take in refugees. I turned it down. The location of Atlantis cannot be revealed, we are not a refuge, and refugees might carry the Punishing Virus with them.	1																					
168	168		301								Lustrous	Some suggested leaving the base immediately for the mainland to join the effort to save humanity. I also turned it down. A few drops of water won't extinguish a wildfire. Our researchers research, they don't save lives.	1																					
169	169		301								Lustrous	I reiterate my stance—Atlantis will not open itself again unless the warning on the Punishing Virus is dismissed.	1																					
170	170		301								Lustrous	My answer was clear from the start. We'll continue our work and keep researching the zero-point reactor. I explained my reasons to my colleagues.	1																					
171	171		301								Lustrous	Firstly, both the base and we are here to serve the reactor. Secondly, this base is powerless to save humanity. Thirdly, there is no better place to understand how the Punishing Virus came to be than Atlantis.	1																					
172	172		301								Lustrous	I want humans to survive, so I must not let Atlantis fall.	1																					
173	173		301								Lustrous	I've adjusted our research direction, trying to replicate the environment of the first reactor and find out where the virus came from. This is the closest thing we can do to "save the world."	1																					
174	174		301								Lustrous	The different reactors would routinely communicate their progress. I have a two-month-old report from the first reactor and nothing else since. I can only hope that they didn't get too far.	1																					
175	175		301								Lustrous	I should be working now instead of doing something as trivial as journaling. Not to mention that I've never done this before.	1																					
176	176		301								Lustrous	The reason I'm doing this is that twice I asked myself—have I done the right thing?	1																					
177	177		301								Lustrous	I said yes both times. My reasons and rationale were clear as always. My action was the logical conclusion.	1																					
178	178		301								Lustrous	But it still feels wrong somehow.	1																					
179	179		301								Lustrous	I once heard a saying that you should toss a coin when you can't make up your mind. If you want to toss it again, you have your answer.	1																					
180	180		301								Lustrous	Which is why I usually ask myself this kind of questions once only.	1																					
181	181		301								Lustrous	Still, I can't deny that this was the first time I "tossed a coin" twice.	1																					
182	182		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lustrous	So I decided to record everything that happened today to remind myself that I've done everything right.	1
