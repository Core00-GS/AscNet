6	6		301									Without a word, Watanabe turns off the radio. Squad 19-1 is still MIA.																						
7	7		301									Still, the situation has significantly improved.																						
8	8		301									After retaking the Titan Trench and the hangar passageway, Squadron 20 now has a better firing position, and Squadron 19 has a smoother attack route.																						
9	9		301									They've managed to reclaim 40% of the K-44 defensive works, and the rest is only a matter of time.																						
10	10		301									Not counting the enemies still putting up resistance in the residential area, things are going quite smoothly.																						
11	11		301									Still, something's not right.

14	14		301							1	Lee	According to my calculations, if the number of enemies is correct, Squadrons 20 and 19 should hold on their own.	2																					
15	15		301								Watanabe	True. But Squads 19 and 20 aren't the kind to mess up... Something's wrong.	1																					
16	16		302								You think so, too?	17																						
17	17		301								Watanabe	Yes.	1																					
18	18		301								Watanabe	However, our priority should be to clear out the residential area up ahead.	1																					
19	19		301								Lee	...I agree with Watanabe.	2																					
20	20		302								Yes.	21
