15	15		301								Vendor	200 Grubs each.	2																					
16	16		301								Customer	What the ****? Is this painted with gold, or made from gold?	1																					
17	17		301								Vendor	Hehe, I can only say that I got it from special connections. Gotta make my risk pay off, mate.	2																					
18	18		301								Customer	You stole it, didn't you? That really makes me uncomfortable. I want a discount!	1																					
19	19		301								Vendor	Hey, don't use that word! I just took it while it was unattended. How about 3 for 550?	2																					
20	20		301								Customer	Why would I need so many? I'll think about it if you do 500.	1																					
21	21		301								Vendor	Deal.	2																					
22	22		301									The vendor picks up 3 accessories from his stall. The silver paint looks brilliant even under the dim light.																						
23	23		301									As if they have just been painted.																						
24	24		301								Vendor	Are these okay?	2																					
25	25		301								Customer	Wait a sec. Are these refurbished?	1																					
26	26		301								Vendor	What? No way. I don't sell refurbished accessories.	2																					
27	27		301								Customer	Then why do I see paint on the barcode?	1																					
28	28		301									There is tension in the air. The vendor suddenly raises his head, staring at the customer, who is giving him a playful look.																						
29	29		301								Vendor	You aren't here to buy, are you? You are looking for trouble.	2																					
30	30		301								Customer	What are you talking about? I would love to buy if your goods are new.	1

37	37		301								???	I'll grab one too.																						
38	38		301								Vendor	That's one good customer out there... ****! It's the Pulao Crew!	2

51	51		301								Pulao	But your stolen goods suggest otherwise.	1																					
52	52		301								Vendor	Goodness no. I got them from Akdilek through legal trades.	2																					
53	53		301								Pulao	"I just took it while it was unattended."	1																					
54	54		301								Vendor	Did you hear everything?	2																					
55	55		301								Pulao	We were nearby before he came to your stall. Now, tell me where you stole them.	1																					
56	56		301								Vendor	Okay! It's the East District! They were left in the warehouse doing nothing but collecting dust, so I thought I could make some use out of them.	2																					
57	57		301								Pulao	The East District... We haven't received any report.	1

66	66		301								Yazi	I have. This is the fugitive that was targeting the night market vendors.	2																					
67	67		301									Yazi shows Pulao a dagger with dried blood stains as she speaks.

73	73		201							2	500445		450

75	75		301								Pulao	Your stolen goods, I mean...	2																					
76	76		301								Pulao	That's why I showed up when he approached you.	2																					
77	77		301								Vendor	****! I knew he was suspicious. How dare he!	1

81	81		301								Vendor	?	1																					
82	82		301								Pulao	Yazi and I were only after the night market murderer. Never thought we would also catch a thief like you.	2																					
83	83		301								Pulao	That's what we call killing two birds with one stone, I guess.	2																					
84	84		301								Vendor	...	1

93	93		301								Yazi	That's my job. After Lady Qu was gone, the Dragon Children all decided to let me out of the shadows and join the Pulao Crew to help with the Nighter's security.	2																					
94	94		301								Pulao	But I think you would fit the Chaofeng Crew better.	1																					
95	95		301								Pulao	It's just a feeling.	1																					
96	96		301								Yazi	I guess Chaofeng still doesn't want me to get my hands on too much intel.	2																					
97	97		301								Yazi	Would you like some tea?	2

99	99		301								Pulao	Sure! Why don't you talk to Chaofeng directly next time?	1																					
100	100		301								Pulao	I'll help too.	1																					
101	101		301								Yazi	No need. He must have his reasons. Besides, I'm quite happy with where I am now...	2

105	105		301								Yazi	Have some of this too.	2																					
106	106		301								Pulao	Dragon's beard candy! Thanks, Yazi. You make me different snacks every night.	1																					
107	107		301								Pulao	Speaking of which, the food intake of a Construct won't really have any real impact on their frame. So... Could I get a little more next time?	1																					
108	108		301								Yazi	Constructs still need to assert self-control. Do you want me to take this away too?	2

117	116		301								Yazi	Should I stay away from you?	2																					
118	117		301								Pulao	No need. A message this late shouldn't be anything important.	1																					
119	118		301								Pulao	"An Engineering Force from Babylonia will be coming to the Nighter at 10:00 am tomorrow in order to assist with the installation of communication antennas. The Pulao Crew will be in charge of their security..."	1
