5	5		301									The scenes in front of you have shifted again in a sway.																						
6	6		301									Like the end of a show when one scene replaces another, the old props are quietly removed, and the new set is hastily put up.																						
7	7		301									Fights that are doomed with failure, roads paved with corpses, flowers torn and shredded.																						
8	8		301									Everything is like a capriccio, taking a sharp downturn and bringing unfathomable cold and darkness.

13	13		301									As long as she can get it back to Babylonia... She must send it back to Babylonia.																						
14	14		301									The surviving Constructs are still waiting in the cabin. She must find rescue to take them out of this place.																						
15	15		301									This time, she will not watch them die in front of her. She must hold on until reinforcements arrive.																						
16	16		301									She can take any pain and pay any price.																						
17	17		301									Still, she ends up being cornered. The frenzy Korolev is only one gate apart from her.																						
18	18		301									She quickly lifts her hand and pierces the Hetero-Core shard right into her chest.																						
19	19		301									Her action is so natural and fast, as if she has done it numerous times before.

33	33		301									Vision is the next. Everything becomes blurry in her blood-stained vision. She can only barely recognize the surroundings through the connection with the space station terminal.																						
34	34		301									As her five senses are gradually stripped away, the pain deep in her M.I.N.D. becomes sharper than ever.																						
35	35		301									Like a crucified god whose flesh and blood body had already been pecked away by vultures, only her soul remains in her body with nowhere to hide.																						
36	36		301									She has lost track of time. No one knows how long she has waited.																						
37	37		301									The space station, which has been quiet all this time, has finally seen another group of "guests."																						
38	38		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Chasing after the tempest, the familiar pink figure has come to her, awakening her from the darkness.

46	46		301									On the other side, a squad still fighting. Gray Raven is their name, and they are connected by a human commandant.																						
47	47		301									The broken Construct learns the name of the human as she synchronizes with the data in the terminal.																						
48	48		301									【kuroname】.																						
49	49		301									...【kuroname】.																						
50	50		301									It seems to be the name of an important person, but she cannot recall who that person is.																						
51	51		301									Somehow, she just feels the name is important. Very important.																						
52	52		301									The stagnant mind starts to flow once again, pulling the thread in her M.I.N.D., reminding her of her incomplete mission.																						
53	53		301									The voice module is completely destroyed. She can only make a strange, humming sound.																						
54	54		301									She could only try her best to send all the data she has, along with the whole truth about the space station, to her trusted friend through the terminal.

66	66		301									She has long lost the sense of time. A sharp, momentary pain and an eternal, bone-grinding lasting pain feel the same to her.																						
67	67		301									But before she falls into eternal sleep, a pair of hands have gathered her shattered consciousness.																						
68	68		301									Has someone saved her?																						
69	69		301									She feels her strength is slowly recovering and her five senses gradually return. Someone is holding her tightly in the arms.																						
70	70		301									The firm, warm arms feel familiar yet detached, as if they had danced together with her in the depths of time, but also as if they had existed only in a fleeting dream.																						
71	71		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Someone is anxiously calling her name.

78	78		301									Someone has been waiting at her side, holding her hand tightly.																						
79	79		301									She wants to find the name that had reached her lips but could not be uttered. It should have been carefully preserved, but her rusted M.I.N.D. has eroded it away.																						
80	80		301									She can see everything around her, but not the face of that person.																						
81	81		301									She can hear all the sounds, but only cannot hear that person's call.																						
82	82		301									She feels like she has fallen through a blanket of fog into the deep waters.

89	89		301									The distant look across the stage in the glorious opera house. The close stare in the illuminated ball room.																						
90	90		301									No matter how hard she tries to discern the faces in these memory fragments, it all ends in vain. The human's face is forever hidden behind the misty night, unable to be recognized.																						
91	91		301									The truth is obvious, but she deliberately ignores it, indulging in what seems like happiness.																						
92	92		301									Those scenes were scattered and shattered in the tempest, but she put them back together and cherished them...																						
93	93		301									They are but illusions of a fleeting dream composed by her.																						
94	94		301									Then she remembers the truth.																						
95	95		301									—They have never really met.
