6	6		301								Murray	Welcome back, Morian.	2																					
7	7		301								Morian	You're up...? How are you feeling?	1																					
8	8		301								Murray	I'm fine, Morian. Your brother may be born with a heart defect, but he's not made of glass. Until it develops into Eisenmenger, I can still move and hop around.	2																					
9	9		301								Morian	Yes—hopping around during palliative care... But you better get ready, because I'll be getting you your surgery soon.	1																					
10	10		301								Murray	Mhm, I know. Oh and, Morian, I read some of your books today...	2																					
11	11		301								Morian	Hm?	1																					
12	12		301								Murray	...Books about neural network and probabilistic programming... I... couldn't understand a thing. All the magazines are featuring scientific articles too lately...	2																					
13	13		301								Murray	"Multimodal machine learning for android kinetic modules" and so on... The prose of that article felt quite like you.	2																					
14	14		301								Murray	I didn't understand a thing, but I still finished it. The author is... hm? Anonymous...?	2																					
15	15		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Morian	...These books are still too complicated for you. Now, if I recall...	1

18	18		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Morian searches beneath the table for a short while, then straightens up and unfolds his palms. A small black robot stands on it, and after a pause, the robot tilts its head.																						
19	19		301								Murray	W-wow! A little robot that moves! Did you make it, Morian?																						
20	20		301								Morian	Yep, the work of your older brother.																						
21	21		301								Murray	That's amazing, Morian! You're even smarter than the person who wrote that article!																						
22	22		301								Morian	...We're probably equal. Never mind that. Let me ask you something else. 100, 010, 001. What do these three numbers mean?																						
23	23		301								Murray	Um... um...																						
24	24		301								Morian	That's 421 in binary. Your birthday.																						
25	25		301								Morian	The binary numeral system is the basis of all computation technology. If you're interested in this, Murray, I'll teach you. As for the robot, you can have it when it's your birthday.																						
26	26		301								Murray	Really?!																						
27	27		301								Morian	Yes, but this little fellow can be made even better. If only I can get my hands on that core chip...
