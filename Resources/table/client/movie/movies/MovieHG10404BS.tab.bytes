35	33		302								Have you been here for the movies before, Bianca?	34																						
36	34		301								Bianca	No, this is my first time in the theatre.	1																					
37	35		301								Bianca	...This isn't a place for Constructs.	1																					
38	36		302								Then you should take this opportunity to enjoy it!	37																						
39	37		301								Bianca	Okay.	1																					
40	38		302								Here. This is for you.	39																						
41	39		301								Bianca	Do I... put this on now?	1

43	41		301								Bianca	Hmm...	1																					
44	42		302								Let me help you.	43	Just put it on like I did.	43																				
45	43		202							1					1																			
46	44		301									Bianca replies with an earnest "yes," then she sits straight and observes how you put on the device. Afterward, her golden irises stare straight at you, unaware of how close the two of you have become.																						
47	45		201							1	500128

57	502		401							1	205																							
58	54		301									As the movie plays, Bianca focuses intensely on it, her eyes widening, her brows frowning as the story ebbs and flows. When a zombie rushes toward Bianca, she looks as if she has just witnessed a new kind of Corrupted.																						
59	55		201							1	500128																							
60	56		301							1	Bianca	What is that?	1																					
61	57		302								That's a zombie.	58	A monster that humans turned into in the myths.	58																				
62	58		301								Bianca	Is that so...	1																					
63	59		301								Bianca	I think the Corrupted might be cuter...	1																					
64	60		302								???	61	Excuse me?	61																				
65	61		202							1					1																			
66	62		301									As the plot unfolds, the romantic comedy part of the movie becomes obvious. As the protagonists meet each other in a hilarious manner, Bianca's solemn expression begins to relax.

68	503		401							3	104004																							
69	64		301							1	Bianca	Hah...	1																					
70	65		302								(Can't believe this kind of comedy will make Bianca laugh.)	66																						
71	66		202							1					1																			
72	67		301									Bianca pays no attention to you. Her eyes are glued to the moving pictures, her mind obsessed with where the story is going.

74	504		401							3	104002																							
75	69		301							1	Bianca	It will only make it more devastating when his hidden identity is discovered. Lies are the prologues of tragedies, after all...	1																					
76	70		302								Relax...	71	It's for the plot...	71																				
77	71		301								Bianca	If his lie is exposed...	1																					
78	72		301								Bianca	Is it impossible for a human and non-human to get a happy ending?	1																					
79	73		302								Hah...	74																						
80	74		301								Bianca	What are you laughing at?	1																					
81	75		302								Nothing. I just thought it's cute how serious you are.	76	I just found you a little different than how I remembered.	76																				
82	76		202							1					1																			
83	77		301									Bianca is too preoccupied with the movie to notice what you said. She bites her lips, having seen another nonsensical sequence.

124	116		301									As the movie plays, Bianca focuses intensely on it, her eyes widening, her brows frowning as the story ebbs and flows. When Dominik shows up, she looks as if she has just witnessed a new kind of Corrupted.
