5	4		301								Lee	Based on our current situation, there is no evidence of a path between the sources of the two factions.	1																					
6	5		302								So... we need to split up?	6																						
7	6		301								Lee	That seems to be the only reasonable course of action.	1																					
8	7		202							1					1																			
9	8		301									So after a brief discussion, you split up into two teams: you with Lee, Lucia with Liv.																						
10	9		301									This guarantees both teams have protective and investigative capabilities.																						
11	10		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					After changing your comms to mid-ranged communication, the two teams of you head your separate ways.

20	19		301							1	Lee	Looks like you're almost ready.	1																					
21	20		302								Seems like I can count on the both of you after all.	21																						
22	21		301								Lee	...? Isn't that obvious?	1																					
23	22		301								Lee	Speaking of which, I've been meaning to ask you something.	1																					
24	23		302								What is it?	24																						
25	24		301								Lee	Commandant, what are your thoughts on Constructs?	1																					
26	25		302								Why do you ask?	27	...	36																				
27	26		204							1	10																							
28	27		301								Lee	...You know what, it's not like I have anything to hide anyways.	1																					
29	28		204							1																								
30	29		301								Lee	Before I was transferred to Babylonia, I was a member of Kurono.	1																					
31	30		301								Lee	Unlike the Task Force, I wasn't exactly fond of that place.	1																					
32	31		301								Lee	I was just curious to hear your perspectives, so I could confirm whether or not I made the right choice.	1																					
33	32		302								...	33	They are valuable companions.	34																				
34	33	37	301								Lee	...	1																					
35	34		301								Lee	...Really?	1																					
36	35	37	301								Lee	I'll take your word for it... for now. I just hope that you're true to your word.	1																					
37	36		301								Lee	...	1																					
38	37		301								Lee	Anyways, let's get back to the mission.	1																					
39	38		301									Lee adeptly sets up the monitoring equipment and begins to establish a holographic scan of the target area.																						
40	39		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lee	There appears to be a residential street from the Golden Age on one end and a large freestanding building on the other.	1																					
41	40		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory304.png																								
42	41		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Lee	Commandant... are you familiar with this type of building?	1																					
43	42		302								Is it a church?	43	Is it an assembly hall?	45	Oh, I know! It's an arcade!	47																		
44	43		301								Lee	Looks similar, but we won't know until we take a closer look.	1																					
45	44	55	301								Lee	But that's en route for Lucia's team. Let's wait for a progress update.	1																					
46	45		301								Lee	Based on the building's location and interior... You might be right.	1																					
47	46	55	301								Lee	But that's en route for Lucia's team. Let's wait for them to report back.	1																					
48	47		301								Lee	...?	1																					
49	48		302								What's that look for?	49																						
50	49		301								Lee	...Commandant, are you joking?	1																					
51	50		302								...Am I not allowed to?																							
52	51		204							1	10																							
53	52		301								Lee	...If that's going to put your mind at ease, then go right ahead.	1																					
54	53		204							1																								
55	54		301								Lee	I wanna know what the building is used for, but that's en route for Lucia's team. Let's wait for them to report back.	1																					
56	55		301								Lee	I've detected a large cluster of signals coming from the residential street. I'll transfer the image to your terminal.	1																					
57	56		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				Alright.	57

59	58		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory306.png																								
60	59		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After pressing a few buttons, the hologram appears on the terminal in your hand.																						
61	60		301									You see a large group of red mechanoids on the residential street.																						
62	61		301									On the far side of the block, mechanoids are coming from various places.																						
63	62		301									In the center of all the red mechanoids, you see a peculiar mechanoid stand out among the crowd.																						
64	63		301									—Even though it bears some resemblance to the others, the rest of the red mechanoids seem to be keeping their distance.																						
65	64		302								Lee.	65																						
66	65		201							1	1011001																							
67	66		301							1	Lee	What is it?	1																					
68	67		302								The mechanoid in the center...	68																						
69	68		302								What's so different about it?	69																						
70	69		301								Lee	That one?	1																					
71	4669		202							1					1																			
72	70		301									Glancing at the hologram, he quickly identifies the mechanoid in question and notices other peculiarities.																						
73	71		301									He adjusts the surveillance equipment, causing the hologram to alter slightly.																						
74	72		301									—Numerous thin red lines extend from the middle mechanoid, connecting to some larger mechanoids nearby.																						
75	73		301									From these larger mechanoids, additional thin red lines connect to the surrounding smaller mechanoids.																						
76	74		302								What are those?	4670																						
77	4670		201							1	1011001																							
78	75		301							1	Lee	Data flow.	1																					
79	76		301								Lee	I've extracted the data flow between the mechanoids and displayed it on the hologram.	1																					
80	77		302								A web?	78	The mechanoids... are interconnected?	81	Is it... a binary tree?	83																		
81	78		301								Lee	Looks like it, but that isn't the case.	1																					
82	79		301								Lee	The data flow between the mechanoids shows that there is a chain of command between them.	1																					
83	80	85	301								Lee	The parent node originates from that mechanoid you pointed out.	1																					
84	81		301								Lee	The data flow between the mechanoids shows that there is a chain of command between them.	1																					
85	82	85	301								Lee	The parent node originates from that mechanoid you pointed out.	1																					
86	83		301								Lee	...I don't think that's an appropriate metaphor, but there's no time to explain.	1																					
87	84		301								Lee	But yes, you can think of it as a binary tree with the central mechanoid controlling all the other mechanoids layer-by-layer.	1																					
88	85		301								Lee	In short, the central mechanoid is the lifeblood of the red mechanoids.	1																					
89	86		301								Lee	If we can destroy it or find an opportunity to analyze it, we should be able to uncover their plan.	1																					
90	87		302								Sounds reasonable. Let's do it.	88																						
91	88		301								Lee	Prepare to move out. Follow me, Commandant. I'll try my best to keep you safe.	1																					
92	89		302								Understood.	90

98	95		301								Lee	...Lucia? Do you copy?	1																					
99	96		301								Lucia	Yeah, we got it. What is it?	2																					
100	97		301								Lee	Lucia, we're moving out.	1
