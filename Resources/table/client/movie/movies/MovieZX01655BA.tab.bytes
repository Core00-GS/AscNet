3	3		301			DialogEnable						Despite the difference in their strength, Roland has still managed to stall Alpha long enough. It is clear who is winning by the end of the fight, yet Alpha cannot fathom why Roland is dead set on stopping her.

5	5		301							1	Œ±	You should know that there's no way you're beating me...	1																					
6	6		301									Alpha removes her blade from the side of Roland's abdomen, and vital fluid pours out from the wound.																						
7	7		202							1					1																			
8	8		301									Roland retreats backward with his hand on the wound, the weapon in his hand still blocking Alpha's path forward.

10	10		301							1	Roland	Don't be... so sure...	1

12	12		301							1	Œ±	What was that?	1																					
13	13		201							1	500008	9																						
14	14		301							1	Roland	Gabriel believes that the only way to create our paradise is to become the strongest Ascendant, holding absolute power in hand...	1																					
15	15		202							1					1																			
16	16		301									Roland raises his gun and aims at Alpha.	1																					
17	17		201							1	500008	5																						
18	18		301							1	Roland	But the Ascension-Network won't allow kindness and mercy in an agent. Intense hatred, pain, obsession... they're where Ascendants draw their strength.	1																					
19	19		301								Roland	Luna's strength and yours have been declining, meaning your wills in the Ascnet have been wavering.	1																					
20	20		301								Roland	If we were to succeed in our goal of destroying humankind and transforming Luna into the strongest agent with absolute power, then you simply must die, Alpha.	1																					
21	21		201							1	500100																							
22	22		301							1	Œ±	Is that why you're hellbent on stopping me?	1

26	26		301							1	Roland	Nah...	1																					
27	27		301								Roland	Luna's initial wish was to create a "paradise she can stay with her sister."	1																					
28	28		301								Roland	But as long as the Ascnet has a leash on her, Luna will never get what she really wants.	1																					
29	29		301								Roland	It took me so long to understand what she truly desires, but it feels like she has yet to realize it.	1																					
30	30		301								Roland	The Ascension-Network has a bigger hold on her than it has on you or me.	1																					
31	31		301								Roland	Gray Raven, and that human commandant... They are the key to her real vision. That's why I must let them go.	1																					
32	32		204							1	5																							
33	33		301								Roland	Do you get it now? I'm not the one you should be stopping‚ÄîGabriel is. He's the one who's been scheming all along.	1

37	37		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	Using us and Luna to fulfill his so-called will of the Ascnet‚Äîthat's his real goal.	1																					
38	38		204							1	3																							
39	39		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Roland informs Alpha of everything he knows about Gabriel's plan.																						
40	40		301								Œ±	...That Gabriel, how dare he leverage all the Ascendants for his idiotic plan.	2																					
41	41		301								Œ±	To betray, abandon, and sacrifice everything for his own ambition‚Äîthat just sounds like a...	2																					
42	42		301								Roland	(Chuckles)	1																					
43	43		301								Œ±	Where's Luna now?	2																					
44	44		301								Roland	If I have to guess... Inside the Polyphage.	1																					
45	45		301								Roland	I couldn't warn Luna in time. I didn't expect Gabriel to move forward with his plan so soon.	1																					
46	46		301								Roland	But if you were also stoked by Gabriel and tried to fight the Polyphage at your current state, then forget about saving Luna, you'd have been devoured as well.	1																					
47	47		301								Roland	Then no one would be able to stop Gabriel.	1																					
48	48		301								Œ±	That's why you're guarding here?	2																					
49	49		204							1	4																							
50	50		301									Roland shrugs, neither confirming nor denying.																						
51	51		301								Roland	So stay calm. If the Gray Ravens get stomped to death by the Polyphage over there, we still have time to come up with a contingency.	1																					
52	52		301								Œ±	I know what I'm going to do.	2																					
53	53		301								Roland	Oh, really? Well, then... I should also start moving.	1																					
54	54		301								Roland	Gabriel's as purist as an Ascendant can be. Luna, you, and I, we're all just tools to accomplish his goal. So...	1																					
55	55		202							1	2				1																			
56	56		301								???	You are correct. Not only Miss Luna... both of you should also become tools of the Ascension-Network! Roland, I do not find your treachery surprising.																						
57	57		201							1	500100																							
58	58		301							1	Œ±	Gabriel...	1																					
59	59		401							1	112																							
60	60		201							1	500101																							
61	61		301									Gabriel steps out of a dark corner, still acting as courteous as ever, but he can hardly conceal the deranged sense of menace he is giving off.																						
62	62		201							1	500008																							
63	63		301							1	Roland	Well, he's all yours.	1																					
64	64		202							1					1																			
65	65		301									Roland smiles again nonchalantly. He whispers something to Alpha as he passes her, before leaping into the darkness within the Core Area with the help of his chain blade.																						
66	66		301									Alpha has already lunged forward with her sword out before Gabriel can make a move.																						
67	67		301									Alpha closes in, attempting to expose a weak spot on Gabriel with a series of continuous strikes. Gabriel is forced back, barely managing to counter her every move with his cane.

70	70		301							1	Œ±	You betrayed Luna.	2																					
71	71		301								Gabriel	...Me? No, Luna is the one who betrayed us, and you‚Äîyou are the reason for her betrayal! You are why she was forsaken by the Ascension-Network! Why she has lost the power of an agent!	1																					
72	72		301								Œ±	Luna... has never betrayed anyone of us!	2																					
73	73		202							2					1																			
74	74		203							1	0.25																							
75	75		301							1	Gabriel	I am sorry, but I cannot let you leave this place. I will not let you disrupt our great ascent because of some frivolous sentiment!	1

79	79		301									Alpha's sword slices across Gabriel's chest, sending sparks flying everywhere. Gabriel rips off his tattered cloak, revealing his colossal mechanical stature.																						
80	80		201							1	500179																							
81	81		301							1	Gabriel	You... really are the biggest threat to the Ascension-Network...	1																					
82	82		301								Gabriel	Are you not going to save your dear sister now that the Polyphage has devoured her?	1																					
83	83		201							1	500100																							
84	84		301							1	Œ±	I know what you're conspiring, Gabriel. You might as well have it written on your face.	1																					
85	85		301								Œ±	If I let you go now, you'll just become a larger threat to Luna.	1																					
86	86		301								Œ±	I can only hope that those Gray Ravens will last long enough for me to get to her.	1																					
87	87		201							1	500179																							
88	88		301							1	Gabriel	I cannot imagine you choosing to believe in those inadequate Constructs. Alas, they have most likely been turned into food for the Polyphage.	1																					
89	89		201							1	500100																							
90	90		301							1	Œ±	No.	1																					
91	91		301								Œ±	This time, I'm choosing to believe in "myself." And, Gabriel‚Äî	1																					
92	92		204							1	17																							
93	93		301								Œ±	What I'm going to do now is destroy you.	1																					
94	94		301									Alpha lifts her katana, her eyes burning with fury.																						
95	95		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Œ±	I will not forgive anyone who hurts Luna.	1
