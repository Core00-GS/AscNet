5	5		301			DialogEnable				1		Haicma walks alone for a very long time.																						
6	6		301									Graffiti and murals pepper her way. She stops to record and analyze each of them.																						
7	7		301									Some of them are simply expressing emotions.																						
8	8		301									â€”Joy, hope, doubt, confusion... Unrestricted, the artists seem to have poured every feeling felt through the brushes without being patronizing or bounded by traditional skills. They look incredibly free.																						
9	9		301									The "revelation" of the machines is likely a result of making these artworks. Like seeing colors in a world of black and white, these machines have expressed their "feelings," recording their doubts and confusions.																						
10	10		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The graffiti begins to reveal sadness, loss, hatred, and fear...

12	12		301			DialogEnable						The further Haicma goes, the richer the graffiti becomes. Sometimes they hide in the corners of the city or blend with nature, and sometimes they are presented proudly and explicitly in plain sight.																						
13	13		301									Haicma gradually learns to identify "Sage's" graffiti from the imitations by "Sage's" followers, but even she cannot say what exactly separates them.																						
14	14		301									A vague image of "Sage" starts to form in her mind. Following the trail of art, she is on the phantom's tail, keeping up closely behind.																						
15	15		301									The graffiti's locations may be spontaneous, but they are not entirely patternless. At least, she can tell that an area with graffiti is relatively safe with fewer Corrupted.																						
16	16		301									Stopping at a street corner, Haicma notices a small, familiar graffiti on a wall, its meaning simple.																						
17	17		301									"Treasure ahead."																						
18	18		301									Haicma follows the words and looks up to find a bookstore. In the Golden Age, humans would put their thoughts on paper with their pens, publishing and selling them in a shop like this.																						
19	19		301									The store signage has already cracked and fallen into the mud. Dangling posters struggle to hang on the shattered shop window, their words only barely legible where they are shaded by the eaves.																						
20	20		301									"Feel the Grains of Paper Once More". "No AI Authors Here".																						
21	21		401							2	759																							
22	22		301									Haicma pushes open the rusty door, and it snaps upon her touch, startling the birds resting on the eaves.																						
23	23		301								Haicma	...Sorry.	1																					
24	24		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She gently puts the door aside and walks inside the bookstore.

27	27		301			DialogEnable						Vines have climbed all over the shelves, pushing away the books and grasping for sunlight from dark corners. Life finds a way.																						
28	28		301									After humans are gone, the wind still carries seeds far and wide, putting down roots in all places.																						
29	29		301									Some humans seem to have stayed here. She can see embers of fires near a nook where books were used as fuel.

31	31		301							1	Haicma	This is...	1																					
32	32		301									Her hand glides over a row of books on the shelf before taking out one of them. Dust flies from her motion, dispersing in the afternoon air.

34	34		301								Haicma	...It's the comic book she mentioned.	1																					
35	35		301									Damped, the pages have become incredibly fragile over time. Just flipping through them can cause them to crumble.																						
36	36		301								Haicma	It's been so long... It's illegible at this point.	1																					
37	37		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Haicma has not pulled up the memory data, but the memories surge up nonetheless as she flips the pages.

43	43		301								Haicma	Certainly. I can retrieve any information you need, including all comics currently published.																						
44	44		301								Nanami	Nanami's asking whether you've read them, Haicma! I really, really, really like them! There're so many cool things in them!																						
45	45		301								Haicma	"Like"...																						
46	46		301								Nanami	You should try them, Haicma... They're so interesting!

51	51		301			DialogEnable					???	Hello. Would you mind returning that issue of "Space Knight: Dawnbreak"?																						
52	52		301									A mechanoid's voice pulls her back to reality.						1																
53	53		301									Looking at where it comes from, Haicma sees an old model delivery droid heading toward her. It has a stack of comics in its arms, asking politely as its camera locks onto the comic book in Haicma's hands.																						
54	54		301								Delivery Droid	It is part of the offerings I am currently collecting.																						
55	55		301								Haicma	Offerings?																						
56	56		301								Delivery Droid	Yes. If I collect enough of them, Sage will return to this place.																						
57	57		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Haicma	...Is that so?																						
58	58		101			DialogDisable	AniZhuanchangEnd			Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory304.png

61	61		301							1	Delivery Droid	Thank you very much! Package received!	1																					
62	62		301									As if having its default command triggered, the delivery droid joyfully holds up the "offerings" in its arms.

64	64		201							2	500486		400																					
65	65		301							1	Haicma	Did you say "Sage" was here?	2																					
66	66		301								Delivery Droid	Yes. "Sage" was here at our headquarters. She was the one who gave me new commands and fixed my body.	1																					
67	67		301								Delivery Droid	To repay her generosity, we are collecting objects that Sage might like, including "cool things" created by humans.	1																					
68	68		301								Delivery Droid	That was the last comic book on our list. Thank you for your assistance. I can return to our headquarters now.	1

72	72		301									With that, the delivery droid turns with a little sway and leaves. Heading straight ahead, it crashes into a fallen bookshelf.																						
73	73		301								Delivery Droid	...Obstacles detected... Adjusting route...	1																					
74	74		203						800	1	0.8	-300	-150	200

79	79		301									The delivery droid stops, the signal light on its head blinking red.																						
80	80		301								Delivery Droid	Adjusting route...	1																					
81	81		301									Haicma realizes that the droid is covered with scratches and dents, old and new. Clear, winding tracks can be found on the ground, going around and around, leaving similar loops on the floor.																						
82	82		301									It seems that this delivery droid has been spinning around here for some time.																						
83	83		301								Delivery Droid	Attempt 2378... Route adjustment failed...	1

85	85		203							1	0.5		-230	200																				
86	86		301									It lowers its head, looking frustrated. It is not intelligent enough to self-diagnose, so it has been waiting here for possible companions to show up.																						
87	87		301									Suddenly, it feels a hand on its head and sees a pair of calming eyes.

90	90		301							1	Haicma	Your GPS is malfunctioning.	2																					
91	91		301								Haicma	I can try to repair and calibrate it.	2																					
92	92		301									This machine needs help. Although it is not part of the commands Haicma received, she still proceeds to the delivery droid's side.																						
93	93		301									She can still help those in need without being commanded, just like what Nanami would do.																						
94	94		301									The delivery droid stares at the humanoid machine before it, and it experiences the same "feeling" it felt when Sage touched it the first time despite Haicma not showing any emotions.																						
95	95		301								Delivery Droid	...Thank you, Lady Big Hat.	1																					
96	96		301								Haicma	Is that me?	2																					
97	97		301								Delivery Droid	Yes. I came up with that name by observing your appearance as Sage taught us.	1																					
98	98		301								Haicma	You can call me... Haicma.	2																					
99	99		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Delivery Droid	Understood, Haicma. You can call me Deli.	1

103	103		301									The delivery droid stands up again, stretching its limbs.																						
104	104		301								Deli	Essential functions repaired. Thank you for your assistance.	1																					
105	105		301								Haicma	...Resources are scarce, so I couldn't completely fix you. I've only calibrated your GPS for now.	2																					
106	106		301								Deli	That is enough.	1																					
107	107		301								Deli	If I may... Haicma, would you return to the headquarters with me?	1																					
108	108		301								Deli	I should repay you for your assistance, but... everything we collected is stored at our headquarters.	1																					
109	109		301								Deli	As a repayment... you are free to choose anything from our collection.	1																					
110	110		301								Haicma	I didn't help you in exchange for something, but...	2																					
111	111		301									The delivery droid mentioned that "Sage" was there before. Perhaps Haicma can find clues about her there.																						
112	112		301								Haicma	...I understand. Allow me to accompany you.	2																					
113	113		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					And so, guided by the delivery droid, the two figures, one tall and one short, begin their journey back to the headquarters.
