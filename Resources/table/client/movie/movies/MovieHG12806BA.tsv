22	23		302								No, not really... You?	24																						
23	24		301								Haicma	I prefer operating at night, so distant stars are what I can see.	1																					
24	25		301								Haicma	Starry nights are calming. They are very suitable for organizing my stored data and collecting my thoughts.	1																					
25	26		302								And reducing stress for the time being.	28

47	50		301								Haicma	It's not very hairy. Humankind's atavism is less severe than I expected.	1																					
48	51		302								Sorry about that.	52																						
49	52		301								Haicma	You don't have to apologize. It's not your fault.	1

62	65		302								How did you figure it out, anyway?	66																						
63	66		301								Haicma	Your wrist was turning slower than usual compared to past records.	1

101	104		301									Still, it is not what you wanted to hear.
