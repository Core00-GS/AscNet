10	10		301								Liv	And then...	2																					
11	11		301								Lee	...?	1																					
12	12		302								Liv?	13	Are you talking about a wedding?	13																				
13	13		301								Liv	Commandant?!	2																					
14	14		301								Liv	I-I'm sorry, I didn't know you were... Ahem...	2																					
15	15		301								Liv	Can I help you with something, Commandant?	2																					
16	16		301								Lee	We should be the ones asking you that. What are you reading?	1																					
17	17		301								Lee	...Weddings? Was that why you were gawking at the church last time? Are you interested in that?	1																					
18	18		301								Lee	I can understand that you might get curious when your new frame looks like a wedding gown.	1																					
19	19		301								Lee	But marriages aren't as wonderful as you think they'd be.	1																					
20	20		301								Liv	You don't get it, Lee! The union between two people is sacred!	2																					
21	21		302								Did you just get angry, Liv...?	22	Yeah, Lee, that was uncalled for.	23																				
22	22	24	301								Liv	I'm sorry... I was...	2																					
23	23		301								Lee	Liv, you know that weddings aren't for us Constructs.	1																					
24	24		301								Lee	I'm not opposing them for any special reasons. I just think that we're better off not thinking about something that won't concern us.	1																					
25	25		301								Liv	Despite what you said, Lee... As a woman, I think they are still something we would envision...	2																					
26	26		301								Liv	I get it... but I can't let go of the idea of a bride in my head...	2																					
27	27		301								Liv	I...	2																					
28	28		302								Then let's go to the church again next time.	29	Should we give this marriage thing a shot?	30																				
29	29	31	301								Liv	I can't ask you to take time away just to accompany me, Commandant. And I've got work to do as well.	2																					
30	30		301								Liv	Marriage... no, I... I just want to go take a look.	2																					
31	31		301								Lee	Go with Commandant, then.	1																					
32	32		301								Liv	Lee?	2																					
33	33		301								Lee	You'll just keep thinking about it if you don't, won't you?	1																					
34	34		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lee	I'll rearrange our missions so that we can visit the church again.	1
