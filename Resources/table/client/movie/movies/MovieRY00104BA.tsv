16	16		301									A strange scene unfolds before you. Watanabe and Ayla are standing on two sides, keeping distance from the Corrupted while preparing to fight.																						
17	17		201							1	500110																							
18	18		301							1	Ayla	According to my calculations, the Corrupted are splitting up, moving toward our east and west.	1																					
19	19		301								Ayla	How are you doing there, ■■■■■?	1																					
20	20		203							1	0.25	-400

22	22		301							1	Watanabe	■■■■■...? What's going on?	2																					
23	23		301								Ayla	...I detected an abnormal signal connecting to my M.I.N.D. 0.34 microseconds ago. This signal must have affected our communication system.	1																					
24	24		301								Ayla	This signal...	1																					
25	25		301								Ayla	Commandant...? You're watching us, aren't you?	1																					
26	26		302								Yep.	28	What are you two doing?	30																				
27	27		204							2	5																							
28	28		301								Watanabe	I see. For a split second, it felt like I was being controlled.	2																					
29	29	31	204							2																								
30	30		301								Watanabe	I'm assisting ■■■■■ in a temporary clean-up mission.	2																					
31	31		301								Ayla	Commandant, care to explain what's going on?	1																					
32	32		302								(Explain)	33																						
33	33		301								Ayla	So you were kidnapped and put into a connection chamber, because of April Fool's Day... And you have problems identifying us.	1																					
34	34		301								Watanabe	But from what you said, the recognition discrepancy didn't happen to Lucia.	2																					
35	35		301								Ayla	Perhaps that connection chamber wasn't fully activated just then... Or maybe there was another reason. Anyway, could you describe what we look like to you?	1																					
36	36		302								You're Ayla and Watanabe.	37																						
37	37		301								Ayla	So I'm Ayla... Hmm.	1																					
38	38		204							2	5																							
39	39		301								Watanabe	Watanabe... huh. Why would Commandant see me as Watanabe?	2																					
40	40		204							2																								
41	41		301								Watanabe	Is this another trick that Lord is playing on me?	2																					
42	42		301								Ayla	The kidnappers mentioned April Fool's Day. It could all be part of that.	1																					
43	43		301								Ayla	Maybe we could find some clues by creating abnormal happenstances. How about...	1																					
44	44		301								Ayla	■■, put your hand on my chest.	1																					
45	45		401							1	205																							
46	46		302								Hold on!	47	That's harassment!	48																				
47	47	49	301								Ayla	It's only a behavioral experiment in order to find out the truth.	1																					
48	48		301								Ayla	Harassment...?	1																					
49	49		204							2	5																							
50	50		301								Watanabe	No, I'm not doing that. In Commandant's eyes, it would be Watanabe putting his hand on Ayla's... chest, right?	2																					
51	51		301								Ayla	Bugs are often discovered in irregularities. Maybe by inducing conflict, we will be able to test the stability of this connection system.	1																					
52	52		301								Ayla	This could be the key to solving this issue.	1																					
53	53		301								Watanabe	I said no. And please don't talk about these weird things with such a straight face!	2																					
54	54		302							487	Why don't we find some other way?	57	Anyway, let's start searching.	58																				
55	55		204							2																								
56	56		303							487																								
57	57		301								Watanabe	I agree! Let's search for Commandant's whereabouts.	2																					
58	58		301								Ayla	I just ran a second risk calculation. We don't know much about the chamber, so any attempts that may possibly crash the system might be potentially harmful.	1																					
59	59		401							3	108003																							
60	60		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Watanabe	Looks like we have to search the area inch by inch.	2
