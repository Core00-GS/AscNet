3	3		301			DialogEnable						On the way to the bridge, you see Sophia staring off into space.																						
4	4		302								What is it?	5																						
5	5		201							1	500127																							
6	6		301							1	Sophia	...I can't say.	1																					
7	7		301								Sophia	It has to do with ACA intel.	1																					
8	8		302								I see...	9																						
9	9		301								Sophia	...	1																					
10	10		301								Sophia	Wait a sec.	1																					
11	11		302								?	12																						
12	12		301								Sophia	Should those who have failed as sinners... be put to death?	1																					
13	13		302								...What's the matter?	14																						
14	14		301								Sophia	...	1																					
15	15		301								Sophia	I don't know if I should say anything.	1																					
16	16		302								If it's a touchy subject, forget it.	17	I want to know.	17																				
17	17		301								Sophia	I think your opinion would be a valuable reference.	1

19	19		301									Sophia hesitates for a moment, takes out a slightly wrinkled letter from her pocket, and hands it over.																						
20	20		301								Letter	My Loyal Bodyguard:																						
21	21		301								Letter	We haven't spoken in quite some time. How have you been recently? Will you come back with the next fuel shipment?																						
22	22		301								Letter	Thanks to the efforts of the Forbidden Imperial Army, just yesterday, we finally disposed of all the explosives planted by the anti-royalists in the carriage.																						
23	23		301								Letter	Anti-royalist leader, "Ashlar", fled before the bodyguards came to the door, but we've already confirmed his whereabouts. In fact, I was just reading the report submitted by the intelligence personnel.																						
24	24		301								Letter	...We'll catch him any time now. But what's important now is: what do we do once we catch him?																						
25	25		301								Letter	Ashton, the leader of the Forbidden Army, wrote me a thick stack of charges suggesting that I expose him to the public, then execute him and his family according to the ancient justice system.																						
26	26		301								Letter	But... I've been wondering if this is really the right thing to do?																						
27	27		301								Letter	Maintain the status quo, kill those who oppose me, and live until I hand over the throne?																						
28	28		301								Letter	Come to think of it, wouldn't I be following in the footsteps of my father? If one day I, or my heir, become like Ashlar, will someone right our wrongs?																						
29	29		301								Letter	On that note, I think change is necessary.																						
30	30		301								Letter	So, my loyal bodyguard, please tell me: if you were me, what would you do with him and his family?																						
31	31		301								Letter	From JA (Imperial Seal)

33	33		301							1	Sophia	...	1																					
34	34		301								Sophia	I don't know how to respond... to Jamilah.	1																					
35	35		302								That "Ashlar"...	36																						
36	36		301								Sophia	...	1																					
37	37		302								Do you think he's evil?	38																						
38	38		204							1	5																							
39	39		301								Sophia	...Very much so.	1																					
40	40		204							1																								
41	41		301								Sophia	But if he's executed, that'll cause trouble down the line.	1																					
42	42		301								Sophia	I don't know why Jamilah would ask me this...	1																					
43	43		301								Sophia	Someone in her position wouldn't need others to help her make such a decision.	1																					
44	44		302								...Is that really the case?	45																						
45	45		301								Sophia	...?	1																					
46	46		302								I think Jamilah...	47																						
47	47		301								Sophia	...	1																					
48	48		302								Just wants your advice.	49																						
49	49		301								Sophia	My... advice?	1																					
50	50		301								Sophia	Jamilah...	1																					
51	51		301								Sophia	Wants my advice?	1																					
52	52		301								Sophia	I don't know.	1																					
53	53		302								Then there's your answer.	54																						
54	54		301								Sophia	I can just say, "I don't know?"	1																					
55	55		302								At least that's how you feel right now.	56	You'll figure it out later.	56																				
56	56		301								Sophia	Really?	1																					
57	57		301								Sophia	...I don't understand.	1
