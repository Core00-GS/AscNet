3	3		301			DialogEnable						You may have experience as a commandant, but the current situation exceeds all your expectations.																						
4	4		301									You are in a small prison cellâ€”judging by the steel cage in front of you and the limited number of furniture in the room, which includes a bed, a water basin, and a toilet, this is a prison for sure.																						
5	5		301									Meanwhile, a mechanoid with its artificial skin peeling off is guarding the room outside, its soulless eyes staring at you. At the entrance are the corpses of two other mechanoids.																						
6	6		301									It is not as if this is your first imprisonment, but it is your first time coming face-to-face with a Corrupted like this.																						
7	7		301									The door separating you two is strong, its sturdy lock capable of withstanding attacks from the strongest weapons, which is a silver lining in this situation. The Corrupted will not be able to damage the door, so at least you are safe.																						
8	8		301									You sigh a breath of relief and lift up your gun.																						
9	9		301									This is the third one.

13	13		401					200		2	1503																							
14	14		301									The bullet pierces through the mechanoid's memory shell, instantly putting a stop to its actions. It drops to the ground by the door with a thud.																						
15	15		301									You immediately move closer and put your hand through the narrow gap between bars. Fumbling around its waist, your fingers find a metal ring. The cool sensation of metal relaxes you.																						
16	16		302								...Got it!	17																						
17	17		301									You finally find the key to the cell on the third "guard" "patrolling" the area. Not wasting any more time, you insert the key into the keyhole on the other side of the door.																						
18	18		401							2	647																							
19	19		301									After trying for the fifth time, you are finally able to free yourself.																						
20	20		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Your short imprisonment comes to an end. The question that remains now is how to leave this place. As for how you got yourself into this predicament...

25	25		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						At first it was just a simple survey mission. After investigating all the nearby devices according to procedures, you found yourself in front of the main entrance of the prison.																						
26	26		301									The thick steel doors were wide open as the prison had long since lost its original purpose, but due to its unique power supply, some parts of it were still operational.																						
27	27		301									This place was infected by the Punishing Virus during the Great Evacuation. Most of the prisoners here escaped amidst the chaos, leaving behind the bionic mechanoid workers.																						
28	28		301									According to the scans, this area contains a huge amount of Corrupted.																						
29	29		301									For the conservation area nearby undergoing restoration, this prison is no doubt an explosive ticking time bomb.																						
30	30		301									In order to prevent the prison's radio jamming from interfering with the clean-up mission, Gray Raven and another team were assigned on a co-op mission together to set up comms equipment outside the building, while you scouted the uninfected areas and the prison.

32	32		401							1	203																							
33	33		301			RImgBg1Shake						The mission was going smoothly until you heard an explosion from deep within the building. You leaped inside the prison through its open doors without even thinking.

37	37		301									The alarms blared and the prison came to life, its red lights flashing inside.																						
38	38		301									You heard rustling from behind, and before you could react, something had grabbed you by your right arm.																						
39	39		301									Turning around, you found a huge mechanoid guard lurking in the shadows behind the door.																						
40	40		201							1	500020																							
41	41		301							1	???	Prisoner confirmed. Captured. Awaiting next command.	1																					
42	42		302								(Try to break free)	43	(Reach for your gun)	44																				
43	43	45	301									The firm grip on your right arm did not loosen. You could not break free.																						
44	44		301									You reached for your gun strapped to your waist, but the mechanoid noticed and grabbed your other arm as well.																						
45	45		301								???	Warning. The prisoner is aggressive. More forceful measures will be taken upon repeated offense.		1																				
46	46		301									The light on the mechanoid guard's head turned red and the weapons on its shoulders aimed at your head.																						
47	47		301									Unable to predict the mechanoid's next move, it was best to just stay put and observe.																						
48	48		301								???	No new commands. Acting according to protocol. Transferring prisoner to cell C-04.		1																				
49	49		401							2	647																							
50	50		202							1					1																			
51	51		301									The mechanoid guard pushed you forward with its weapon as the doors of the prison closed up behind you.																						
52	52		302								(Crap...!)	53																						
53	53		301									But whenever you showed a sign of struggle, the mechanoid would raise its weapon as a warning, forcing you to give up your plans for a sneak attack.																						
54	54		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					That was how you were "transferred" to the cell.

59	59		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Recalling the path you took when you were being "transferred," you soon find yourself in the warden's office.																						
60	60		301									Luckily, the area you are in has a relatively low virus concentration, and the mechanoids you have encountered on the way have shown no signs of infection. Their hostility dissipated after you took the key and Authorization Chip from the guard.																						
61	61		301									The office, simply put, is a mess. It is not hard to imagine what happened here. Even the specks of dust are frozen in time, and nothing has changed since the moment of evacuation.																						
62	62		301									Looking around, you find an old control system and a comms device under some old newspaper.																						
63	63		302								(Try to activate it)	64																						
64	64		401							2	1515																							
65	65		301									The system monitor lights up at your touch.																						
66	66		301									The control system confirms that the prison's emergency mode was activated due to an unknown reason. All passages leading outside have been sealed, and if you want to open the doors here, you need to activate the unique command in the main control room with the correct password.																						
67	67		301									Turning your attention to the comms device on the side, you find that its communication range is limited to within the prison.																						
68	68		301									You have no way to confirm if your signals will be picked up by the comms equipment set up by your team outside, but this is currently your only way to communicate in this closed-off space.																						
69	69		301									So you operate the device and send out a distress signal.																						
70	70		301									As you wait for a reply, you explore the warden's office and find a blueprint of the prison. Thankfully, your time has not been a complete waste.																						
71	71		401							2	1515																							
72	72		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Just when you begin to think that no one has received your message, the signal connection lights up.

78	78		301									The silver-haired young man stands in front of the comms equipment with interest, focusing on the flashing signal.

80	80		301								Roland	Interesting.	1																					
81	81		301								Roland	I wasn't expecting visitors except for myself.	1																					
82	82		301								Roland	I wonder whose luck was so rotten that the poor thing got trapped in here with me?	1																					
83	83		301									The signal continues to flash, pausing for a second before resuming, like the lamp on a struggling ship caught in a storm.																						
84	84		301								Roland	And this isn't a random shot in the dark... The one who sent this seems to be quite collected.	1																					
85	85		301									I thought this would be my one-man show. Color me surprised to find another actor onstage.																						
86	86		301								Roland	It's not my style to let such an interesting opportunity slip away, is it now?	1																					
87	87		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					He places his hand on top of the reply button.
