4	4		301									In the last 11 seconds of this dire battle, the train finally starts moving again.																						
5	5		301									The twins continue following the train without being drawn away by the departing crowd.																						
6	6		301									Once they reach their planned location, Lee and Chrome work together to assemble Omega II with some alloy plates, fixing it to the broken surface of the carriage.																						
7	7		301									From their experience, the twins should soon strike the alloy plates, which means coming into close contact with Omega II. However, as if noticing the danger within, the twins have yet to approach.

9	9		201							2	500418		400																					
10	10		301							1	Lee	Could it be that they've learned to recognize the Omega Prototype, having encountered it before?	1																					
11	11		301								Chrome	If that's the case, they'll just dodge even if we toss it at them.	2																					
12	12		301									Nodding, Lee takes out a polarity-masking case from his tactical backpack and removes Omega II from the alloy plate, putting the weapon inside the box.																						
13	13		301								Lee	I found this polarity-masking case when we were repairing Asslam. It's usually used to hinder searches, so we can give it a shot.	1																					
14	14		202							1	2				1																			
15	15		201							1	500416	5																						
16	16		301							1	Lucia	Alright.	1																					
17	17		202							1					1																			
18	18		301									But before Lee can throw the case toward the twins, they immediately back away for several hundred meters the moment Lee pokes his head out.																						
19	19		201							1	500416	5																						
20	20		301							1	Lucia	Is the masking device ineffective against them?	1																					
21	21		203							1	0.25	-400																						
22	22		201							2	500417		400																					
23	23		301							1	Lee	I don't think so. If anything, I suspect that they might have recognized when we were about to attack. From now on, we should treat them as intelligent enemies instead of mindless drones.	2																					
24	24		301								Lucia	Did we expose Omega II too soon when we installed it?	1																					
25	25		201							2	500418		400																					
26	26		301							1	Chrome	Not really. We already deployed Omega II when we were trying to create an opening for the people to evacuate.	2																					
27	27		301								Chrome	If the twins are still somehow connected to the Hetero-Creatures, they will know how dangerous this train is right now.	2																					
28	28		301								Lucia	In that case, our best shot is to bring the masking case into direct contact with them.	1																					
29	29		202							1	2				1																			
30	30		301									Looking at each other, the three of them turn their gazes toward the inside of the carriage, searching for something to aid their fight.																						
31	31		301									Apart from the nine Constructs who chose to stay behind and the three Constructs from Support Force who delivered Omega II, they are surprised to find two more humans there.																						
32	32		201							1	500416	5																						
33	33		301							1	Lucia	...Why didn't you leave?	1																					
34	34		201							1	500262																							
35	35		301							1	Shrek	Neither of us could move anymore.	1																					
36	36		301									He moves his motionless legs with his hands, explaining his situation.																						
37	37		301								Shrek	One wound on my left lower leg, another on the outside of my right thigh.	1																					
38	38		301								Shrek	Both my tendons are ruptured. My legs are practically numb now.	1																					
39	39		301								Shrek	I might not be a medical expert, but... this seems like the kind of injury that would leave me impaired even after surgeries.	1																					
40	40		301								Shrek	Still, I don't know how to perform a surgery like that. No one here does. Not that we'd have the means to do it.	1																					
41	41		301									He puts down his blood-soaked legs, the tourniquets around them covered with written records of time, erased and updated. The last update was two hours ago.																						
42	42		301									Perhaps he was hurt for too long, or maybe he realized help would not arrive in time, but Shrek has given up on releasing the tourniquets on time to ensure his blood flows and prevent his leg muscles from being damaged.																						
43	43		301								Shrek	I'd only slow the group down had I followed them, so I decided to stay. As for Garcia...	1																					
44	44		301									He nudges the pale, young man next to him, but Garcia is already in shock from losing too much blood.																						
45	45		301								Shrek	I checked, and I think his liver and kidneys are punctured, and some arteries somewhere are damaged too. The train has run out of medical supplies long ago.	1																					
46	46		301								Shrek	I thought we could figure out something when we got off the train. But it was too late before the train even stopped.	1																					
47	47		301								Shrek	So we let Watanabe know and had him prioritize those who could still move.	1																					
48	48		301								Shrek	Right, and Matches left with him as well.	1

52	52		301							1	Chrome & Lucia & Lee	...	1	2	3																			
53	53		301									The two of them know full well what it means to stay behind, yet here they are so that they would not burden the others.																						
54	54		202							1	2	3			1																			
55	55		201							1	500262																							
56	56		301							1	Shrek	Stop pouting and say something. You guys still have work to do, don't you?	1																					
57	57		201							1	500417																							
58	58		301							1	Lee	...	1																					
59	59		301								Lee	He's right. We have to solve our immediate problem if we want a shot at treating the ones who've stayed.	1																					
60	60		203							1	0.25	-400																						
61	61		201							2	500416	5	400																					
62	62		301							1	Lucia	Leave the task of confronting the twins to me. I'll come back with my short-range jet.	2																					
63	63		301								Lee	It might work if we were doing this on land, but you wouldn't be able to return to a high-speed train.	1																					
64	64		301								Lucia	You're right. I'd need a backup plan, which was why I was looking for this.	2																					
65	65		301									Lucia pulls out an abandoned handbag underneath the seats and puts the masking device inside before taking out a bundle of thin steel cables, holding onto one end.																						
66	66		301								Lucia	I'll tie the other end inside the carriage. If something goes wrong, I'll make use of this.	2																					
67	67		202							1					1																			
68	68		203							2	0.25																							
69	69		301									Lucia and Lee nod at each other. Having made sure that Lucia is well-prepared, they open the door to the carriage.																						
70	70		301								Lucia	I'll leave this place to you.	2																					
71	71		202							2					1																			
72	72		301									Lucia quickly steps out of the train, dashing toward the twins with her thruster.																						
73	73		301									Right as she is about to reach them, the twins' movements suddenly hasten, and they retreat behind the many Hetero-Creatures.																						
74	74		201							1	500417																							
75	75		301							1	Lee	Watch out!	1																					
76	76		202							1					1																			
77	77		301									Lee holds onto the steel cable, yet to be fully unfurled, and he pulls it back with all his strength.																						
78	78		301									With the force of the pull, Lucia manages to change course and fly back into the carriage right before hitting the Hetero-Creatures.																						
79	79		201							1	500418		400																					
80	80		201							2	500417		-400																					
81	81		301							1	Chrome	That was... Was Lucia right about the masking device being ineffective against them?	1																					
82	82		301								Lee	Either that or they have become wary of anyone who tries to approach them once they no longer can detect the location of Omega II.	2																					
83	83		301								Lee	Tricky situation either way.	2																					
84	84		201							1	500416	5	400																					
85	85		301							1	Lucia	Let's determine which one it is, then we'll come up with an answer.	1																					
86	86		301								Lee	Alright.	2																					
87	87		202							1	2				1																			
88	88		301									Lee returns to the first carriage, hiding the handbag with the masking device in a safe location. He then takes a similar bag and places a piece of rock of similar size inside.																						
89	89		301									Lucia takes the bag and dashes out of the train again.																						
90	90		301									The result is the same as last time—the twins immediately retreat to the back, avoiding contact with Lucia.																						
91	91		201							1	500416	5																						
92	92		301							1	Lucia	Now, to test the other theory.	1																					
93	93		301									She places the bag with the rock within the gap between two alloy plates before cutting off a corner, letting the bag falls out of the carriage.																						
94	94		301									The twins do not move away this time, letting the bag roll onto the ground by them.																						
95	95		301								Lucia	So, it's not the bag that they're wary of—	1

104	104		301									Before Lucia can finish, the twins launch another attack on the train.																						
105	105		301									The impact separates the remaining twelve carriages, and the three Constructs who stayed at the back are about to slip away with the broken-off cars.																						
106	106		301									Lucia rushes forward and catches the desperately running Lee, throwing him above the carts so that he can make use of the crumbling walls to make his way to the front. Meanwhile, she escapes the collapse with the help of her thruster.																						
107	107		301									Chrome, following closely behind the two, catches the steel cable, still tied to the other end, and fires all the ice bullets from his gunblade. Taking advantage of the recoil and the elemental energy, he also manages to retreat to the safe carriages.																						
108	108		301								Shrek	Garcia!																						
109	109		301									Hearing Shrek's cry, the three Constructs look back, yet to regain their footing, just in time to see the young man who was in shock from blood loss fall off the train from the broken edge, landing next to the twins.																						
110	110		301								Lucia	...!																						
111	111		301									Lucia tries to step out and save the innocent man, but Shrek, mournful and hurt, stands in her way.																						
112	112		301									Following his gaze, they see the twins have Garcia firmly clasped, saving him from the impact to the ground, only to condemn him to the highly-concentrated Punishing Virus, and his flesh quickly festers in their arms.																						
113	113		301								Shrek	...It's too late. Let him go.																						
114	114		301									Is it just the wind howling? The young man's voice trembles, his words seemingly a wail.																						
115	115		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Shrek	I couldn't catch him... I failed.
