11	11		301							1	Ayla	Oh, it's you, Commandant. What's up?	1																					
12	12		302								What are you doing?	13																						
13	13		301								Ayla	What does it look like?	1																					
14	14		202							1					1																			
15	15		301									The desktop is covered with what appears to be building blocks...																						
16	16		301									Upon closer inspection, the blocks appear to be arranged in a frame resembling a question mark.																						
17	17		302								What's this?	18																						
18	18		201							1	500110																							
19	19		301							1	Ayla	I'm creating a puzzle.	1																					
20	20		301								Ayla	It's the latest work I'm going to show.	1																					
21	21		301								Ayla	It's something that was referred to as "installation art" during the Golden Age.	1																					
22	22		301								Ayla	The point of this piece is to raise "questions" for the viewers.	1																					
23	23		302								A puzzle?	24	"Installation art"?	25																				
24	24	27	301								Ayla	It's an art piece... designed to raise "questions" for the viewers.	1																					
25	25		301								Ayla	Yes, it was a type of artwork during the Golden Age.	1																					
26	26		301								Ayla	Using an "installation" to propose "puzzles" and "views" for the audience is an important form of expression.	1																					
27	27		301								Ayla	So, Commandant, do you know how to solve this puzzle?	1																					
28	28		302								(Examine closely)	29

30	30		301									Aside from the "question mark," it just looks like a bunch of strangely-shaped blocks...																						
31	31		301									...?																						
32	32		301									Looking more closely, you see some peculiar blocks among the others.																						
33	33		301									Maybe because you frequently have to link your consciousness with others in battle, you seem to be more acutely attuned to the shape of signals.																						
34	34		302								(Pick up a block)	35																						
35	35		301									The shape of the blocks appears to match the question mark.																						
36	36		301									Or rather, be inserted into it...																						
37	37		301									After rotating the blocks a few times, blocks along the bend of the question mark appear to fit together.																						
38	38		302								I see...	39

41	41		202							1					1																			
42	42		301									Maneuvering the blocks once more, you turn the question mark into an exclamation mark.

44	44		301							1	Ayla	Well, you really are worthy of being a commandant...	1
