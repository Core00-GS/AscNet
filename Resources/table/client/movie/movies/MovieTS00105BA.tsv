6	6		301			DialogEnable				1	Lee	Lucia... That's enough. If it was going to work, it would've worked already... We've lost contact with Liv.	1																					
7	7		301								Lucia	...Let's turn around to find her immediately.	2																					
8	8		301								Lee	(Peeks from your hiding place) The moment we entered this group of buildings, we had already alerted all the guards.	1																					
9	9		301								Lee	If we turn around now, we'll be facing an uphill battle.	1																					
10	10		301								Lucia	Lee... you're saying...	2																					
11	11		301								Lee	I'll go look for Liv. You stay here to protect Commandant.	1																					
12	12		301								Lee	I originally thought that Liv and Browning had successfully activated the distractor, and they had shut off their comms for technical reasons...	1																					
13	13		301								Lee	But seeing the number of guards here, I'm pretty sure there's no distraction device to begin with.	1																					
14	14		301								Lee	(Holds up the device in his hand) This is the distractor we found on the enemy's body earlier, but it was busted long ago.	1																					
15	15		301								Lee	Even if we can contact Liv, there's no way we can lure the guards away for her with this.	1																					
16	16		301								Lucia	You were right about Browning. Something's wrong with him.	2																					
17	17		301								Lee	I only made my hypothesis based on the facts we had.	1																					
18	18		301								Lee	I had my suspicion when Browning recommended splitting us up.	1																					
19	19		301								Lee	Doesn't matter if Liv's in danger or not. The fact that she's with Browning right now is my responsibility.	1																					
20	20		301								Lee	And now I must find her.	1																					
21	21		301								Lucia	I'm also responsible...	2																					
22	22		301								Lee	(Looks at you) You have to stay with Commandant. My frame is not powerful enough to guarantee the commandant's safety.	1																					
23	23		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	I see... Our frames are different, aren't they? I'll leave Liv to you.	2
