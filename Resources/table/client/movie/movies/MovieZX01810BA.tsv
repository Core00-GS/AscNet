56	56		301									There's no time to avoid it...

247	247		301								Wanshi	Your commandant stabbed the bit domain node into it right at the last second.	1																					
248	248		301								Lee	The commandant did that?!	2																					
249	249		301								Wanshi	Babylonia has established the coordinate system and is heading over us to prepare for the orbital strike. But now that the fourth bit domain node has been activated, there's still hope for redemption.	1																					
250	250		301								Wanshi	If you catch my drift.	1																					
251	251		301									Lee nods solemnly.																						
252	252		301								Lee	Understood. What's the situation with you and the commandant?	2																					
253	253		301								Wanshi	Well, for me... There are problems everywhere, but my M.I.N.D. is still stable and corruption is below the threshold. I just need to take a load off.	1																					
254	254		301								Lee	Now's not that time for that. Keep that in mind.	2																					
255	255		301								Wanshi	Sheesh... I was just joking.	1																					
256	256		301								Lee	I'm not laughing. Once you bring the commandant back safely, then you can crack jokes.	2																					
257	257		301								Wanshi	Got it.	1																					
258	258		301								Lee	...Are you still able to escort the commandant?	2																					
259	259		301								Wanshi	Pff... I'm more than capable of protecting a human.	1																					
260	260		301								Lee	Understood. I'll prepare the camp. Repair your frame when you get back.	2																					
261	261		301								Lee	Also... Thank you for protecting our commandant.	2																					
262	262		301								Wanshi	You should thank your commandant for the data you're looking at right now.	1																					
263	263		301								Wanshi	Your commandant risked death in order to acquire data that's satisfactory for both sides.	1																					
264	264		301								Wanshi	If the Chief Commander can be persuaded to inform Babylonia to launch a precision strike, all of our problems will be solved.	1																					
265	265		301								Wanshi	This is your mission. Don't let your commandant's efforts go to waste.	1																					
266	266		301								Lee	Understood.	2

275	275		301							1	Hans	What is it this time, Gray Ravens.	2																					
276	276		301								Hans	Babylonia is about to reach us in orbit. We'll receive orders to retreat in less than half an hour.	2																					
277	277		301								Lee	We just received news that our commandant is returning to camp.	1																					
278	278		301								Hans	I don't care about any news regarding that fugitive. Tell your commandant not to do anything stupid. 【kuroname】 still has time to make it back through the flank and evacuate in time.	2																					
279	279		301								Lee	Our commandant knows what to do, which is why we are here again.	1																					
280	280		301								Lee	The commandant encountered a massive Hetero-Creature during the operation. The Strike Hawk Construct collected a large amount of relevant data during the battle.	1																					
281	281		301								Lee	Based on the data, Liv from our team modeled the evolution of the Red Tide.	1																					
282	282		301								Hans	...Go on.	2

284	284		301									Lee activates the terminal and projects the hologram for Hans to see.																						
285	285		301								Lee	This is a gradient map of the Punishing Virus compiled by the Strike Hawk while exploring the source of the Red Tide.	1																					
286	286		301								Lee	As you can see, the Punishing concentration of the Red Tide increases along with the depth... This area is at its peak.	1																					
287	287		301									Lee points to the last picture sent by Wanshi. It is a lake composed of sanguine Red Tide located in the center of the hologram.																						
288	288		301									And to the image of the ominous black Hetero-Creature.																						
289	289		301									After just a glance, Hans nods.																						
290	290		301								Hans	I see. Turn it off.	2																					
291	291		301									Lee nods and replaces the hologram with the original data model.																						
292	292		301								Lee	Also, this is a flow map of the Red Tide.	1																					
293	293		301								Lee	The core cluster is situated in the center of the flow map. Here, the Red Tide increases flow outward and spreads just like... a heart pumping blood throughout the entire body.	1																					
294	294		301								Lee	Finally, this is a statistical model on the behavior pattern of Hetero-Creature in the core region. We've established that the Red Tide spreads when the Hetero-Creature makes that noise.	1																					
295	295		301								Hans	Get to the point.	2																					
296	296		301								Lee	The Red Tide has a source, and this Hetero-Creature is the culprit for spreading the Red Tide.	1																					
297	297		301								Lee	By eliminating it, we can finally put an end to the Red Tide and solve all of our problems.	1																					
298	298		301								Lee	The commandant took the most logical course of action by jamming the last bit domain node into the Hetero-Creature...	1																					
299	299		301								Lee	Babylonia will be overhead soon. I'll apply for a revision to the attack plan, thereby focusing the Longinus Arsenal on the bit domain node deployed by the commandant.	1																					
300	300		301								Hans	What makes you think this will put a stop to the Red Tide?	2																					
301	301		301									Lee suddenly lowers his voice.																						
302	302		301								Lee	I'm not sure. But Chief Commander, you have higher authority. You should be aware of the CTO's speculations regarding the Red Tide's origin.	1																					
303	303		301								Lee	—It's a vestige of the Hetero-Core. According to the records of our operations against the Hetero-Core on the space station, it's impossible to destroy such an entity with wide-scale strike.	1																					
304	304		301								Lee	What I present to you is only objective facts and data. A wide-scale strike was never an insurance plan to start with.	1																					
305	305		301								Lee	Combining various factors, such as atmospheric thickness, scattering rate, Babylonia's firepower, and Punishing Virus activity...	1																					
306	306		301								Lee	The Longinus Arsenal may look impressive, but we can't ensure that it will be a success. The blast will be dispersed over too great of an area, thereby reducing the strength of the laser's power.	1																					
307	307		301								Lee	But if we launch a precision strike, it's like stabbing a needle directly into the enemy's heart to stop it from beating. After that, all we have to do is deal with the body.	1

325	326		301								Hans	Change in plans. The Gray Raven Commandant broke protocol and discovered a large Hetero-Creature similar to the one we encountered in the ruins of 075.	1																					
326	327		301								Hans	The data we received from the commandant indicates that the nature of the creature is similar to that of a Polyphage.	1																					
327	328		301								Hans	Judging from the flowing Punishing energy, this Hetero-Creature is likely to be the source of the Red Tide.	1																					
328	329		301								Hans	The Gray Raven Commandant planted the last bit domain node into the Hetero-Creature. I've applied to change from a wide-scale attack to a precision strike to focus all our attack power on the Hetero-Creature, thereby ensuring the elimination of the Red Tide.	1

343	338		301								Hans	Mr. President, the Science Council didn't have our current data when formulating this plan.	1																					
344	339		301								Hans	I think it's time to make a reasonable contingency plan based on the new data.	1

360	358		301								Asimov	Interesting. Very interesting... Looks like the fourth bit domain node is key to all of this.	2																					
361	359		301								Hassen	You think so? The troops on the front line have requested to switch from a wide-scale attack to a precision strike on the fourth bit domain node.	1																					
362	360		301								Asimov	On a case by case basis, their judgment is reasonable based on the model they transmitted back.	2																					
363	361		301								Asimov	I first speculated that the Hetero-Core fragment in the Polyphage was the origin of the Red Tide.	2																					
364	362		301								Asimov	I just couldn't understand why the Red Tide continued to spread after the Polyphage disappeared.	2																					
365	363		301								Asimov	Turns out it found a new source of power.	2

389	385		301								Hassen	I'm not finished, Hans.	1																					
390	386		301								Hassen	After the first attack, we will wait for 20 minutes to observe the effect. If it is ineffective in stemming the Red Tide, we will launch a second attack. However, this time it will wipe out the area indiscriminately with a wide-scale attack.	1																					
391	387		301								Hassen	Two consecutive attacks will consume 90% of Babylonia's energy supply, compromising Babylonia's anti-air defenses.	1
