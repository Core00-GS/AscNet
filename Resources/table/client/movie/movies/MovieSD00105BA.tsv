23	23		301								Lee	Bianca's hat... You didn't steal all of this... Did you?	1																					
24	24		301								Nanami	Nope, nope! I just... borrowed them. They've got extras just sittin' around. It'd be a shame to just let them go to waste! Look! I also brought one of your jackets, Lee!	1

38	38		301								Lucia	Well, if you think about it from another point of view... She might still be surprised.	2																					
39	39		301								Lucia	It's the thought that counts. As long as Liv is happy, I'm sure the commandant won't mind.	2																					
40	40		301								Lee	You're right. After all, the commandant has always been understanding. I don't think Nanami's "surprise" will disappoint.	1
