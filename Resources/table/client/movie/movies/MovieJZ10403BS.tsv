3	3		301			DialogEnable						In the church devoured by the shadows of the night, all that could be heard was weeping, screaming, and scolding. And in the midst of the chaos, is the bloodstained Bianca standing in front of the statue of God.																						
4	4		301								Sister A	She's the "witch"! She's the one who killed Toby!																						
5	5		301								Sister B	It really is because of her... All those who have disappeared, they are all probably...																						
6	6		301								Bianca	No, I...																						
7	7		301								Father Leon	Silence, you murderer!																						
8	8		301								Sister C	(Sobs) Toby...																						
9	9		301								Sister A	I watched Toby grow up, he was always so optimistic and kind. Now his future's ruined, all because of you...																						
10	10		301								Sister D	Why did you do it? Why him? Is that how you treat someone who has helped you before? Are you going to treat us like that too? Like how you killed the father and Toby?!																						
11	11		301									Some weep around Toby's body, while others stay strong and comfort the others with tears in their own eyes.																						
12	12		301								Bianca	...																						
13	13		301								Citizen A	Stay away, you devil!																						
14	14		301									The angry mob no longer gains satisfaction from purely throwing insults at Bianca and resorts to throwing anything they can get their hands on.																						
15	15		301								Citizen B	Get outta here! Outta our city! Demons like you aren't welcomed here!																						
16	16		301									"Slap—"																						
17	17		301									Someone from the angry mob comes forward and slaps Bianca with all his might. He was about to give her a second slap before someone stops him.																						
18	18		301								Citizen C	Get outta the way. Let me avenge Toby.																						
19	19		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Father Leon	Leave. You have contaminated this holy ground with your bloody ways, sister. From this moment onward, you no longer represent this church!

21	22		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Bianca is pushed out of the hall by the crowd, staggering for a few steps before regaining her footing.																						
22	23		301									She ignores all the insults and things thrown at her, clasps her hand in front of her chest, and slowly bows toward the church.																						
23	24		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Soon after, she turns to leave, running forward and disappearing into the night.

28	29		201							1	500139																							
29	30		301							1	Citizen B	Father Leon is too merciful in my opinion. We should've had her executed there on the spot! Who knows what disasters she's bringing to people elsewhere now.	1																					
30	31		201							1	500136																							
31	32		301							1	Citizen C	Hmph, she's lucky she got away. If she ever comes back, I'll kill her myself.	1

33	34		301									A Bianca in rags creeps out from the shadows after the three angry citizens left.

36	37		202							1					1																			
37	38		301									She weakly staggers through the main street, but quickens her pace when she hears another conversation taking place nearby, dodging into an alley on the other side.																						
38	39		301									Bianca only let out her breath after confirming the people talking had passed by. Relaxing, she sits down on the ground, leaning on the wall.																						
39	40		201							1	500024	17																						
40	41		301							1	Bianca	Did I do... the right thing?	1

44	45		301							1	Bianca	Who's there?!	1																					
45	46		202							1					1																			
46	47		301									Bianca cautiously looks for the owner of the voice in the depths of the alley. However, the speaker never meant to conceal himself and slowly walks out of the shadows.																						
47	48		201							1	500130																							
48	49		301							1	Wen	Allow me to introduce myself. I am Wen, the chairman of Daedalus.	1																					
49	50		202							1					1																			
50	51		301									Wen is dressed in a sleek black suit. He halts in front of the frail Bianca and extends his right hand.																						
51	52		201							1	500130																							
52	53		301							1	Wen	Relax, I come in peace. I am just a normal businessman.	1																					
53	54		202							1					1																			
54	55		301									Bianca doesn't lower her guard and refuses to shake Wen's hand. Wen doesn't take offense to her actions, instead, he stands up smiling and turns to face the direction of the distant church.																						
55	56		201							1	500130																							
56	57		301							1	Wen	How foolish the mortals, they cannot understand the saint, they betray the saint, kill the saint, yet the saint still loves the mortals no less.	1																					
57	58		301								Wen	Bianca, sacrifice is necessary in order to save the masses.	1																					
58	59		201							1	500024	17																						
59	60		301							1	Bianca	You?!	1																					
60	61		201							1	500130																							
61	62		301							1	Wen	Oho, no need to be surprised. I know all that happens in this city, nay, in this whole area. Nothing can escape me as long as I desire to know.	1																					
62	63		301								Wen	This is my card. My company provides one thing for the people and one thing only—safety.	1																					
63	64		202							1					1																			
64	65		301									Wen produces a silver card from his jacket's inner pocket and hands it over to Bianca. As soon as Bianca takes the card, information about Daedalus is projected into the air in front of her.																						
65	66		201							1	500130																							
66	67		301							1	Wen	As you can see, my company is mainly responsible for the extermination of people who have been infected with the virus in order to protect others.	1																					
67	68		301								Wen	Not just in this city, but all the cities from Kuzath Snow Plain to the south are under my protection.	1

74	75		201							1	500130																							
75	76		301							1	Wen	If the Corrupted outside are the enemy, then those who possess a risk like Toby and Snow are hidden liabilities.	1																					
76	77		301								Wen	What we do is the salvation of the world. We find the helpless infected who may turn into a threat at any moment, and we relieve them of the suffering, which in turn guarantees the safety of others.	1																					
77	78		301								Wen	This is the right decision made to save more people, and is also an act of justice in order to achieve social stability.	1																					
78	79		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Wen	Just like what you've been doing all this time.	1

82	83		301								Wen	That's right.																						
83	84		301									Wen extends his right hand once more toward Bianca.																						
84	85		301								Wen	You have talent. Join us and I'll make sure you'll receive the power you're worthy of. Let us save this world on the brink of death together with that power.

117	119		201							1	500130																							
118	120		301							1	Wen	You may have power, but etiquette is a habit and restraint, it is also a warning to oneself, allowing us to remember our identity and the responsibility we carry.	1																					
119	121		301								Wen	You will understand eventually.	1																					
120	122		301								Wen	That will be all for today.	1
