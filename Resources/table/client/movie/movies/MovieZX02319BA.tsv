3	3		301									It has been 28 days since Liv left for Babylonia. This is also the 10th afternoon they have spent stuck in the church.																						
4	4		301									Dusk falls onto the blood stains covering the churchyard, hoping to conceal them, only to accentuate the crimson color.																						
5	5		301									After the twins left, the train finally came to a halt next to a forest in the middle of nowhere, its limit reached.																						
6	6		301									Before they could perform any repairs, they were soon surrounded by waves of Hetero-Creatures, and they were forced to retreat and put up defenses inside this nameless church.																						
7	7		301									Having tried to break through the enemies several times, they only ever find themselves cornered in a new location.																						
8	8		301									Those twisted horrors have marked their names. Those creatures will haunt them every step of the way like shadows, inseparable.																						
9	9		301									In order to contain the destruction, the three of them decided to stay in the church, using it as a base of operation.																						
10	10		301									But no fights can go on forever. They have been resisting on church grounds for ten days after the pursuit of Asslam.																						
11	11		301									With their supplies lost, their resources are about to be depleted when one of their terminals finally rings.

15	15		301								Changyu	Whoa, you look terrible.	13																					
16	16		301								Changyu	But that's alright, 'cause we're bringing you some supplies, and we've also brought a few Babylonia Constructs to help you.	13

20	20		301								Changyu	Relax. Akdilek has been working with the Nighter, so don't you worry about us.	13																					
21	21		301								Changyu	After we got settled, we went back for some of Watanabe's folks as well.	13																					
22	22		301								Changyu	I know it's pretty bad where you are, so stop turning us away. We just borrowed these supplies from the Nighter anyway.	13																					
23	23		301								Changyu	We're almost there. I bet you're all feeling very grateful.	13																					
24	24		301								Lucia	How are Jamilah's injuries?

39	39		301							1	Lucia	It was Changyu and Sophia. They're bringing us some supplies to repair ourselves...	2																					
40	40		301								Lucia	I told them not to come, but they insisted and said they'd be here soon.	2																					
41	41		301									Lee does not answer. He is on the brink of collapse, his broken right arm yet to be properly repaired, deteriorating from infection.																						
42	42		301									Dusk and silence, exhaustion and wounds, they weave together a web that binds the two of them to the bench they are sitting on, with no hope to escape.																						
43	43		301									Even with all their struggles, time has not granted them room to breathe.																						
44	44		301									Only when a speck of dust falls on her shoulder from the chandelier in the church does Lucia drag her damaged frame up, supporting herself with her katana.																						
45	45		301								Lucia	They're back.	2																					
46	46		301								Lee	...	1																					
47	47		301								Lucia	I'll get Chrome. His frozen attacks can still buy us some time.	2																					
48	48		301								Lee	...	1																					
49	49		301								Lee	Any news from Babylonia?	1																					
50	50		301								Lucia	No. But our mission report and reinforcement request have been received.	2

52	52		301								Lee	Have they abandoned us?	1																					
53	53		301									Lucia does not answer. Lucia does not know how to answer.																						
54	54		301									They are already knee-deep in an impossible situation. The Hetero-Creatures would still fight to their death even if Babylonia sent in armies and transport crafts now.																						
55	55		301									When the cost of a rescue mission outweighs the result, no one life is worth more than a dozen others.																						
56	56		301									To Lucia and Lee, Gray Raven's spirit will live on as long as Liv and 【kuroname】 are safe on Babylonia.
