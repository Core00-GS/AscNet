6	6		301								Admin Director	Her name is Lamia, ma'am.	2																					
7	7		301								Admin Director	She's doing well. The staff on the island all like her.	2																					
8	8		301								Lustrous	Like her? Are you kidding me?	1																					
9	9		301								Admin Director	I'm not. Everybody likes her. She's an "interesting" kid. You can go take a look just to kill some time.	2																					
10	10		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lustrous	I have no time to "kill," and you shouldn't have any either... But I am getting a little curious since even you are making such a comment.	1

15	15		301							1		When Lustrous finds Lamia, this little human has made a tottering tower using the coffee cups others gave her.																						
16	16		301									Leaning on the cardboard fence, Lustrous takes away the few cups at the top. The tower wobbles a bit, then becomes balanced again.

23	23		301									Taking the coffee cup away—negative emotion.																						
24	24		301									Giving the coffee cup back—positive emotion.																						
25	25		301									Extremely low emotional threshold. Emotional shifts can be triggered by tiny stimulations.																						
26	26		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The emotional logic of human infants differs significantly from that of adults. Interesting.

33	33		301								Lustrous	Is that so?	1																					
34	34		301								Medical Director	Lamia couldn't talk the last time you were here. Now she can say some basic words.	2

66	66		301									It used to be a ward, but has been transformed into Lamia's personal room with the medical director's special approval.																						
67	67		301									The desk is made from a pharmacy table, while the infusion chair has been modified into a working chair. Both of them are still too tall for Lamia, as her mechanical legs are unable to touch the ground when she sits on the chair.																						
68	68		301									A few lines of simple equations are written on the paper.																						
69	69		301									This time, the data director has come to check on Lamia.

79	79		301								Lustrous	Good. We have the same conclusion.	2																					
80	80		301								Lustrous	I heard she was learning mathematics recently.	2																					
81	81		301								Data Director	How's her progress?	1																					
82	82		301								Lustrous	I don't know.	2																					
83	83		301								Data Director	Fine, I'll test her myself.	1																					
84	84		301								Data Director	The following definition is constructed: addition is an operation which combines two or more numbers into a single number. Define multiplication in the same manner.	1

92	92		301								Lamia	S-sorry, the question is too difficult... I don't know...	1
