5	5		301							1	Nanami	Wow! Can Nanami open it? Now?	1																					
6	6		301									With your approval, Nanami immediately goes after the wrapping paper, but she suddenly stops before tearing it apart. She shakes the mystery box, and it makes a quiet grating sound inside.																						
7	7		301								Nanami	If this is a mystery box, won't it be cool if Nanami can guess what's inside before opening it?	1

9	9		301								Nanami	Hmm, it's pretty light... Don't tell me you didn't actually put anything in there, Commandant?	1

11	11		302								That can't be...	12																						
12	12		301								Nanami	Well, then I'm going to guess that it's a secret component to upgrade Power!	1																					
13	13		301									With that, Nanami opens the box quickly and finds a stack of beautiful astrology stickers inside. Unique and elegant, the graphics might as well be designed by an artist from the WGAA.																						
14	14		301								Nanami	I got it right! Nanami is the best!	1																					
15	15		301									Before you know it, Nanami has already put a few stickers on her giant mech.																						
16	16		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Nanami	Look, Commandant! Doesn't Power look more prepared to travel the stars now? Let me make sure they stick... Power, don't you lose them, okay?	1
