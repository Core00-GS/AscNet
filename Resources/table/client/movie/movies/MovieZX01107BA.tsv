55	50		301								Pulao	Right. The Kowloong Crew has power, but we can't use it against Huaxu. Hell, some of us even got comfortable living like this.	2																					
56	51		301								Lee	And will they stand in the way of our mission?	1																					
57	52		301								Pulao	As far as I can tell, Chaofeng, Fuxi, and I are the last holdouts who are still trying to rescue the leader and set ourselves free.	2																					
58	53		301								Pulao	The rest of the Kowloong Crew are ambiguous in their stance. And I suspect that some of them have already had their minds transferred...	2
