7	7		301									The sound of girls playing echoes on the trail in the woods. The nonexistent sunlight shines through the withered branches, almost warming up your face while leaving the lower half of your body cold and chilly.																						
8	8		301								???	Come on...																						
9	9		301									Two blurry shades chase each other, one of them turning around and waving.																						
10	10		301								???	Take my hand.

19	19		301									No. 21 follows after, and the shade disappears once again at the end of the path, leaving nothing but her lingering voice.																						
20	20		301									No. 21 is fast. Despite the shade appearing intermittently, she can still follow her brief appearances precisely, staying on the right track.

28	29		301									One vision after another... You feel like you are in a dream, trembling as the scenery shifts in and out of the bright sunny day.																						
29	30		301									Abrupt emotions take hold of you. You sweat underneath the connection device. You can hardly tell whether you are on Babylonia, inside Kurono's interrogation room, or if you were physically standing on the rotten land.																						
30	31		301									In this torturous back-and-forth, you are almost lost in the current, except the white Construct, constantly moving, is there to remind you that this is real.																						
31	32		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The light grows dimmer amidst the clouds. Air and dust form a thick, moving storm, and the wind bellows like gray waves crashing to the shore.

35	36		301									The night wind howls and an unearthly light shines overhead, casting No. 21 in the shadow of the giant house behind the iron gate.

37	38		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					You look toward the source of the light to find a full moon setting in the west. Moonlight shines through the crooked gap extended from the roof to the wall, covering the debris lying outside the house.
