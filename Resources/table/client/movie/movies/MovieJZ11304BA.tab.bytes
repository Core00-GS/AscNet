4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Vera	They all relied on their own ideals, their experience... and then they just died, leaving me here alone with the pain.	1																					
5	5		301								Vera	They were all the same.	1																					
6	6		301								Vera	I joined the Military Academy... studied tactics... all because I wanted to do something... for someone.	1																					
7	7		301								Vera	But why... What went wrong?	1

9	9		301			RImgBg1Shake						Vera starts pummeling the walls with her fists, letting the pain course through her veins.																						
10	10		301								Vera	It's all the Punishing Virus's fault! Why did this stupid virus have to appear? Why do humans have to be defeated by some dumb virus?	1																					
11	11		301								Vera	It's not my fault! I didn't do anything wrong. I always try to offer suggestions, but no one ever listens.	1																					
12	12		301								Vera	I always do my job to the best of my ability, but some things are just impossible!	1																					
13	13		301								Vera	It's not my fault at all! I'm not Death... I don't want to be Death!	1																					
14	14		301								Vera	I came to the battlefield to save people!	1																					
15	15		301									Vera's M.I.N.D. begins to boil, dizziness overtaking her throbbing head.																						
16	16		301								???	...Can't you be quieter, bud? Did you really have to yell all that out like that?																						
17	17		301									As Vera slumps against the wall, a familiar voice speaks from the detention room next door. It is the Construct who called Vera "Death".																						
18	18		204							1	4																							
19	19		301								Vera	So you heard all of that?	1																					
20	20		301								Construct	Yeah.																						
21	21		301									Silence follows. After a few minutes, the Construct speaks again.																						
22	22		301								Construct	I'm sorry... I shouldn't have called you Death.																						
23	23		301								Vera	...	1																					
24	24		301								Construct	Hey, say something, yeah? It took me a while to speak up. Apologizing takes courage, you know.																						
25	25		301								Vera	Apology accepted.	1																					
26	26		301								Construct	Is that all?																						
27	27		301								Construct	Tch, you're a weird one. We still have a while left in here. Shall we chat?																						
28	28		301								Vera	I refuse.	1																					
29	29		301								Construct	People spread rumors because of your aloof attitude. Don't you know?																						
30	30		301								Vera	I don't want to go with the flow. I didn't become a Construct and enter the battlefield to please others.	1																					
31	31		301								Construct	Same here.																						
32	32		301								Construct	Like you, I didn't end up amounting to anything. The others, too.																						
33	33		301								Construct	So I guess I changed, too. For the worse.																						
34	34		301									All who chose to become soldiers did so for their own reasons... but they inevitably succumb to the pressure on the battlefields.																						
35	35		301									Not even Vera remembers what motivated her in the beginning.																						
36	36		301									All she remembers is fleeing from battlefields... only to be forced to enter the next battlefield, which she will also flee from.																						
37	37		301									She curls up in the corner, fists balled up in front of her chest, clutching the fabric of her shirt.

39	39		301							1	Vera	What's the point of surviving every battle? My life right now... Can it even be called living?	1																					
40	40		301							1	Vera	The world is filled with nothing but despair and pain. What can we even do?	1
