10	10		301								Yarha	No. 21 is now completely at her disposal—	1																					
11	11		301								Kurono Leader	...What are you afraid of? Having second thoughts as her creator?	2																					
12	12		301								Yarha	No, I'm just amazed. I didn't expect Vera and No. 21 to be so compatible... Seems like No. 21 is acting more like a human after spending time with Vera.	1																					
13	13		301								Kurono Leader	Human... Bahaha! She'll never be human again! Constructs are just weapons.	2																					
14	14		301									Yarha resists the urge to argue with his superior. He might not be suitable for Kurono, but it's his best choice.

25	25		301								Kurono Leader	I want you to go back to Daedalus' research division.	2

27	27		301								Kurono Leader	Who said it was trash?	2																					
28	28		301								Kurono Leader	We've put a stop to Daedalus' little tricks they been pulling behind our backs all these years. They've been collecting lost data from the Golden Age during the early days of the Punishing Outbreak in order to independently conduct Construct modification and expand their arsenal.	2																					
29	29		301								Kurono Leader	According to our research, a lot of rare and valuable data from the black market ended up in Daedalus.	2																					
30	30		301								Kurono Leader	With the collapse of Daedalus' headquarters... The Babylonians were able to take advantage of a lot of people.	2																					
31	31		301								Kurono Leader	The research institute was Daedalus' last haven. Since they were still conducting Construct modifications, the remaining data must be there.	2																					
32	32		301								Kurono Leader	You two are the most suitable for the job.	2																					
33	33		301								Kurono Leader	Yarha decrypted the topographic map of the institute and found a hidden area.	2

75	76		301								No. 20	Er... Maybe they're having trouble? After all, who doesn't want to be with family in a world like this? Maybe they're watching you each day from behind the scenes. Even so...
