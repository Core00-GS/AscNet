5	101		302								Sorry, Chief...	4																						
6	4		301								Nikola	Hah... Maybe I should make an appointment the next time I want to see you, hmm?	1																					
7	5		301								Nikola	Forget it. Let's make haste. Asimov, are the equipment ready?	1

10	6		301							1	Asimov	Well, the energy system and safety release valves are slightly different from Babylonia standards, but they're all based off of our tech, so it wasn't that hard to fix.	2																					
11	7		301								Nikola	Just give me your conclusions.	1																					
12	8		301								Asimov	It's ready for use. It just needs to be tested for us to know for sure.	2																					
13	9		301								Nikola	I'm sure you know why you're summoned here. You're here today to test the team formation system developed by the ARU.	1																					
14	104		302								Why me?	10	Team formation system?	11																				
15	10	13	301								Nikola	You're the F.O.S. top graduate. You're the most ideal candidate for testing the system's limits. That's all.	1																					
16	11	12	301								Asimov	We found a program framework located in the Niflheim labs in the Arctic. It's old stuff, but the design direction is revolutionary and of great reference value.	2																					
17	12	13	301								Asimov	After all, when it comes to war, people at that time were much more experienced than us.	2																					
18	13		301								Nikola	Enough chit-chat. Any other questions?	1																					
19	105		302								Nope... Not that the moment.	14																						
20	14		301								Asimov	Alright. Then come here and put on this headset.	2																					
21	15		301								Nikola	It's not a deep dive kinda deal?	1																					
22	16		301								Asimov	The ARU didn't have that sorta tech back then. This is just an audiovisual simulation program.	2																					
23	17		301								Nikola	It doesn't matter. Or maybe we can test your true mettle more accurately this way. Let's begin.	1																					
24	18		301								Asimov	Okay. Here goes...	2
