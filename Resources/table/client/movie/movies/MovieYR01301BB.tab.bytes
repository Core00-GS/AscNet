5	5		301							1	Kamui	Commandant‚ÄîAh, Liv and Lee, you're here too. Great! Let's all play a game together!	1																					
6	6		301									As usual, Kamui strolls cheerily and breezily into the Gray Raven Lounge, greeting the preoccupants.

9	9		301							1	Liv	A game?	2																					
10	10		301								Kamui	Yep! I got my hands on this thing over here!	1																					
11	11		301									Kamui waves the thing in his hand. It looks like a faded box, with the picture of a vacation beach on the cover and a title that reads "Memories O'nÔΩûVenus Beach".																						
12	12		302								Could this be...	13	This looks a little like those types of...	13																				
13	13		204							1	1																							
14	14		301								Kamui	That's right! It's what they call a game cartridge in the Golden Age! You don't really see 'em anymore!	1																					
15	15		301								Kamui	Looks fun, yeah?	1																					
16	16		201							2	500026		400																					
17	17		301							1	Lee	Not at all. I don't really care if you play games in your leisure, but don't drag us into it. Would be one hell of a joke if my first disciplinary action since joining Babylonia came from playing games with you.	2																					
18	18		301								Lee	You know that to us Constructs, we have no need for entertainment.	2																					
19	19		301								Kamui	But Commandant said you, Karen, and the others played card games before! Isn't that entertainment?!	1																					
20	20		301								Lee	Those were pure mechanical and probabilistic calculations. There's nothing wrong with that.	2																					
21	21		301								Kamui	Oh yeah? Games CAN also just be interactive virtual spaces. AND, game design involves a lot of pure mechanical and probabilistic calculations that's all the heat in the Golden Age. Shouldn't that be right up your alley?	1																					
22	22		301								Lee	...	2																					
23	23		301								Kamui	And, and, this game is super fun! Even Lucia said so!	1																					
24	24		302								Lucia plays games?	25																						
25	25		301								Kamui	I saw her by herself so I asked, and she said yes super quick! That threw me for a loop, Lucia is just so affable now!	1																					
26	26		301								Kamui	But halfway through the game, she said she had to do personal training and scooted off.	1																					
27	27		204							1	2																							
28	28		301								Kamui	So I came over to play with you guys! This game is more fun with more people!	1																					
29	29		301								Lee	Don't you have anything else to do? Say... combat training? Liv and I are busy.	2																					
30	30		204							1	1																							
31	31		301								Kamui	But you've already reassembled your gun eight times while I'm talking, and Liv is just staring at the lounge walls. And, Commandant, you're just back from the last mission, right?	1																					
32	32		301								Kamui	Humans! Especially humans after a long day of work! Need some proper entertainment to relax!	1																					
33	33		301								Kamui	Constructs don't get tired like humans, but prolonged and intense battles can cause bad data to clump up in our M.I.N.D.s! At times like these, it's good to wind down!	1																					
34	34		301								Lee	What you say should make a lot of sense, but suddenly, not so much when it's coming out of your mouth. Sorry, but playing games just sounds like stuffing junk files into my M.I.N.D.	2																					
35	35		301								Kamui	Commandant! Help me convince the guy!	1																					
36	36		302								I'll deal with the disciplinary actions, if there are any.	37	Let's all play some games and chill!	37																				
37	37		301									Lee sighs. He gives off an I-knew-you'd-say-this face.																						
38	38		301								Lee	I knew you'd say that, but Kamui is a member of Strike Hawk. It's not good to spoil him too much.	2																					
39	39		302								So it's okay to spoil my own members?	40	Yeah! Got it!	42																				
40	40		204							2	6																							
41	41	43	301								Lee	That's not what I meant... Never mind.	2																					
42	42		301								Lee	I don't think you got even a fraction of it.	2																					
43	43		301									Despite Lee's dismissive words, he seems to have acquiesced.																						
44	44		301								Kamui	Wa-wa-weewa! Lee is actually so nice today!	1																					
45	45		301								Lee	Looks like you're dying to part with your vocal module.	2																					
46	46		202							1	2				1																			
47	47		201							1	1031001	1																						
48	48		301							1	Liv	...	1																					
49	49		302								Liv, join us too!	50																						
50	50		301								Liv	Well... If you say so, Commandant...	1																					
51	51		202							1																								
52	52		401							3	106003																							
53	53		301									Kamui gives a cheer and quickly powers up a game console he brought in from who knows where. He then shoves the game controllers into the hands of the trio.																						
54	54		301									After setting up the device, Kamui stares at the screen and begins to skillfully navigate through the menus.																						
55	55		201							1	1081001	2																						
56	56		301							1	Kamui	You can scan and upload your appearance in this game! I'll help you guys import your data. Lee, don't forget to use a cooler-looking one! Oh, Liv, which frame's appearance do you want to use?	1																					
57	57		201							1	1031001	1																						
58	58		301							1	Liv	Let me think... I'll use my Luminance frame.	1																					
59	59		201							1	1081001	1																						
60	60		301							1	Kamui	Oh, right, right, Commandant, you gotta put this on.	1																					
61	61		301									Kamui comes close and hands over a device.																						
62	62		301								Kamui	I borrowed this deep-dive VR headset from the Virtual Center. Commandant, you can't image virtual avatars like us Construct, so it's easier for you to use this instead.	1																					
63	63		201							1	500026																							
64	64		301							1	Lee	If I recall, Constructs have to fill out an application form and go through a lot of trouble to borrow from Babylonia. You sure went out of your way, huh.	1																					
65	65		201							1	1081001	1																						
66	66		301							1	Kamui	Because I want to play games with Commandant! Are you ready, Commandant?	1																					
67	67		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					And so, you put on the VR device according to Kamui's instructions...
