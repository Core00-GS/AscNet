10	10		301									The horrific virus had spread everywhere except high altitude areas like the Arctic. Only a special serum can mitigate the effects of the virus.

23	23		204							1	5																							
24	24		301								Rosetta	But why?! I don't understand...	1																					
25	25		301								Pfaff	Because Grandpa has sinned. Far more than the Forest Guards... So there's no need to feel any regret.	2

27	26		301								Rosetta	But Grandpa, you've never done anything bad. How could you be a sinner? They must've made a mistake!	1																					
28	27		301								Pfaff	Rosetta, listen to me. Killing the narwhal is our only chance to be allowed into the ARU.	2																					
29	28		301								Rosetta	If that's the case, then I don't wanna join 'em! Weren't we doing okay just living in the forest?	1																					
30	29		301								Pfaff	For me, it is, but not for you. I can't allow you to be stuck there your whole life. You need friends... You need a future...	2

47	45		301								Rosetta	If you are the Guardian Spirit of humanity, please listen to my only prayer...

49	47		301								Rosetta	Please, save my grandpa... Please... I beg of you...																						
50	48		301									Only with the speed of the narwhal, can the two of them make it back to New Murmansk with the serum they have left.																						
51	49		301								Pfaff	Rosetta, give up... It's not a guardian spirit at all. It won't respond to you.																						
52	50		301								Pfaff	We created it... It's just a cold and heartless machine. It's an irrevocable proof of our sin in a foolish age.																						
53	51		301								Rosetta	But it chose to protect humanity rather than fight. It's our friend, not a cold-hearted weapon.

63	60		301									The narwhal lets out a series of groans as if dissatisfied with the silly name, taken and arranged from Drake Passage.																						
64	61		201							1	500213	6																						
65	62		301							1	Rosetta	Grandpa, no matter what happened in your past, the three of us have to get back alive. It shouldn't end here!	1
