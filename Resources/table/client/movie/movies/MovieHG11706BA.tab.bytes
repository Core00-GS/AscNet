4	4		301									Luna can hear her sister calling.																						
5	5		301									She fears the dark. The loneliness is suffocating.																						
6	6		301									Why... Why can't I wake up...?

8	7		301									A reddish glow flickers in the distance. It is the only thing visible for Luna in the darkness.																						
9	8		301									So... dark...																						
10	9		301									She has never been struck with such pain before in her life.																						
11	10		301									Becoming an Ascendant would mean that she has nothing to fear anymore‚Äîor so she once thought.																						
12	11		301									But just a pitiful dream, a piece of memory buried in her mind, has broken her.																						
13	12		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Sister... anyone... please... She extends her hand to grasp at something.																						
14	998		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory288.png																								
15	13		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						That red flickering light shines like a lighthouse at sea. She reaches for it like a drowning soul.																						
16	996		502							RImgBg1BlowUp																								
17	997		301									Her minds tells her to not reach for it, but the painful memories in the past is etched into her very instincts... And so, she reaches for the red glow.																						
18	14		301									Something terrible, something painful, must have happened there. That glow must not be light, but a horrible truth.																						
19	15		301									Like a moth drawn to flame, Luna reaches for the light uncontrollably.																						
20	16		301									The memories are a shackle upon her... She is repeating the past, things that she cannot change.																						
21	17		301									Like replaying a video, Luna can only be abandoned, betrayed, and forced on a path of no return, a path built upon innumerable souls‚Äîover and over.																						
22	18		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The red light is getting closer.

26	20		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					But when she reaches her hand out, she comes into contact with something soft instead.

42	34		302								It's not that bright, but pretty handy.	35	It's small, but bright for its size.	35																				
43	35		301									You pick the small Luna up. She is so light that you almost feel like you are holding a balloon.

51	41		301								Luna	You speak too much.	1																					
52	42		301									Luna silences you. You only hear the sound of your breaths as you walk.

57	46		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The moon is just rising, but already bright enough to light up the entire place. Turns out, you have been in yet another landfill the whole time. The blinding darkness just then feels almost like a dream now.

71	59		301								Luna	I don't need you to pity me.	1																					
72	61		301									She stares at you with an expression you have not seen before‚Äîone of a malformed pride, welded together from thorns and blood.	1																					
73	62		301									And these thorns... sprout out and encase her. At the same time, the world is torn apart as if by a tempest.	1																					
74	63		301									Under the moonlight, Luna perches in the eye of the storm. The rippling winds, her flitting white gown‚Äîthey come together like mist, like the winter sky, like the traceless clouds, like a dove, dying, plummeting.	1
