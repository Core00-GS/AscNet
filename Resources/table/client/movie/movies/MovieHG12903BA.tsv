19	19		401							2	658																							
20	20		301									Even when their limited firepower cannot damage the Corrupted significantly, the soldiers' concentrated barrage still manages to push the Corrupted back closer and closer to the planned location.

23	23		401							2	660																							
24	24		302								Alright, hold fire.	25																						
25	25		301									The Construct soldiers stop shooting. Their guns are still drawn, but the soldiers know that the fight is over.

28	28		301								Corrupted	—!!!	1	2																				
29	29		301									Without the constant pressure from the Constructs' firearms, the Corrupted immediately revert to their frenzied stage, hoping to charge in and tear their enemies apart.

34	34		301									But they quickly find themselves standing on nothing—the ground below their feet suddenly collapses, and the new giant hole devours them whole.																						
35	35		201							1	500019																							
36	36		301							1	Construct Soldier	You were right... That floor couldn't support so many Corrupted and collapsed.	1																					
37	37		401						600	1	36																							
38	38		401							1	208																							
39	39		301									That seems to be the roof of an old shopping mall. The deserted structure failed the moment it could not withstand the weight of the Corrupted, burying everything that was standing on top.																						
40	40		302								Karenina figured it out, after all.	41																						
41	41		301									It is because of her accurate assessment that the Corrupted could be so effortlessly dispatched—every bullet is a valuable resource at a time like this.																						
42	42		301								Construct Soldier	In that case, the Corrupted in this region are all eliminated.	1																					
43	43		302								Thanks for all your work.	44																						
44	44		301								Construct Soldier	We're used to it. I reckon the Engineering Force are the hardest-working ones right now. The materials for the reconstruction are still on their way, while so many are still in need of a roof...	1																					
45	45		202							1																								
46	46		301									You have been seeing Karenina going back and forth between different parts of the conservation area ever since she demolished that unstable building, and you have rarely seen her rest.																						
47	47		301									You happen to have a construction materials list that requires Karenina's approval before submitting it to Babylonia, so you decide to find her after this mission.																						
48	48		302								All clear. Dismiss.	49																						
49	49		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Confirming Karenina's whereabouts on your terminal, you are surprised to find out where she is.

53	53		301							1		Amidst this dead mountain, the lively girl who suddenly appears is all the more noticeable.																						
54	54		301									Carefully, Karenin retrieves a black panel from beneath a pile of trash.																						
55	55		301								Karenina	Get the fork out!	1

59	59		301									In the blink of an eye, Karenina pulls the panel away with a "Woosh!", and the rubbish stacked above it only sways ever so slightly.																						
60	60		301								Karenina	Hmph! Perfect...	1

63	63		401							2	1506																							
64	64		301									Before she can finish feeling smug, the still pile of trash suddenly rushes toward her like an avalanche, almost drowning her—the panel only survives since she raises it above her head at the last minute.																						
65	65		302								Karenina?!	66	Are you alright?!	66																				
66	66		204							1	7																							
67	67		301									Hearing your shout, the Inver-Devices above Karenina's head poke through the trash pile that has buried her all of a sudden.

71	71		301									Almost simultaneously, she jumps out nimbly—																						
72	72		204							1	6																							
73	73		301								Karenina	W-what are you doing here?!	1																					
74	74		302								Phew. You don't look injured...	75																						
75	75		204							1	4																							
76	76		301								Karenina	Hmph, of course! How can this junk even hope to hurt me... I was just caught by surprise.	1																					
77	77		301									Karenina skips to your location. Only at this distance can you tell that her face is covered with dirt, from where you cannot say.																						
78	78		204							1	1																							
79	79		301									But she does not seem to care. Her smeared face highlights her sparkling eyes in the sun.																						
80	80		301									Even more sparkling is the panel in her hand... blinding, even.																						
81	81		302								What's that you got there?	82																						
82	82		301								Karenina	Hm? This? This is a solar thermal collector from ages ago. It was used to collect and store solar energy.	1																					
83	83		301								Karenina	It's pretty cold at night right now... The Scavengers who moved out might have a place to stay, but they have nothing to keep them warm. I want to make a simple heating device with this and a few other things.	1																					
84	84		301									Karenina fiddles with her hair by her ear, her gaze darting around.																						
85	85		204							1	4																							
86	86		301								Karenina	After all, it's too dangerous for them to make a fire in their shelters... The Engineering Force'd have to clean up their mess if they start a fire...	1																					
87	87		302								I'll help.	88																						
88	88		204							1	7																							
89	89		301									Karenina blinks and looks at you in disbelief.																						
90	90		301								Karenina	You? This isn't commanding a squad. It takes alertness and awareness, not wit.	1																					
91	91		204							1	1																							
92	92		301								Karenina	It takes experience and imagination to determine if what you found is valuable... if it's "treasure" or "trash."	1																					
93	93		302								All I see here is trash...	94	Fascinating insight!	94																				
94	94		301									As she speaks, she bends down to grab a small, inconspicuous device from the pile and throws it your way.																						
95	95		302								What is that?	96																						
96	96		301								Karenina	The port for an energy converter. It's a bit damaged right now, but I should be able to fix it.	1																					
97	97		301								Karenina	I used to go treasure-hunting in the slums with Grandpa back in the slums. We would find all kinds of parts to assemble machines that we didn't know.	1																					
98	98		301									Karenina takes the port back and easily fixes it before attaching it to the panel.																						
99	99		301								Karenina	Even unassuming junk... can become treasures that help people in the hands of engineers.	1																					
100	100		302								Amazing...	101																						
101	101		302								Let me look for some "treasures" as well.	102																						
102	102		301									You look around and see a small object glistening in the sun. Picking it up, you find a chip with an intricate circuit attached to it.																						
103	103		302								Karenina! Take a look!	104																						
104	104		301									Taking the small trinket from you, she flips it around in the sun. Light passes through its translucent shell, scattering into a rainbow of colors. But Karenina eventually shrugs.																						
105	105		301								Karenina	It's just a small bulb for decoration, not something useful, unfortunately. At most, it'd give off a little bit of light... if it isn't broken. Definitely "trash."	1																					
106	106		302								What a shame...	107	I guess this is where it belongs.	107																				
107	107		301									Disappointed, you take the small bulb back, ready to throw it back into the trash pile.																						
108	108		204							1	8																							
109	109		301								Karenina	Hold on... Don't throw it away!	1																					
110	110		204							1	1																							
111	111		301									Karenina grabs it from you before observing it closely and smiling.																						
112	112		301								Karenina	I suppose it's fate that you picked it up. Leave it to me! I'll turn this small glass ball into the shiniest light there is!	1																					
113	113		301								Karenina	We can probably place it... Alright! There!	1																					
114	114		301									Looking at where Karenina is pointing, you find a familiar structure hidden behind some buildings.																						
115	115		302								The Ferris wheel?	116																						
116	116		301								Karenina	That's it. Isn't a Ferris wheel decked out with lights? Let's put this up there to join the party.	1																					
117	117		302								It looks much smaller than the one in Venus Splash Park.	118																						
118	118		301								Karenina	Sure, but the structure of this Ferris wheel is sturdy. We can keep it up there and not worry about it falling down.	1																					
119	119		204							1	4																							
120	120		301								Karenina	If the power system still works, we might even be able to turn it back on. And then... Tch. Now's not the time to think about that!	1																					
121	121		301									Turning away from the Ferris wheel, Karenina bends down to collect the "treasure" she found.																						
122	122		302								Do you like Ferris wheels?	123																						
123	123		204							1	6																							
124	124		301								Karenina	Me? Nah. I just recalled that night at Venus Splash Park when I didn't...	1																					
125	125		204							1	7																							
126	126		301									Suddenly, Karenina freezes unexpectedly and blushes.																						
127	127		302								Karenina?	128																						
128	128		204							1	6																							
129	129		301								Karenina	W-why is my face so dirty?!	1																					
130	130		301									Karenina hurriedly rubs her face with her hand—she seems to have noticed her appearance from the reflection of the solar panel.																						
131	131		301								Karenina	Why didn't you say something?!	1																					
132	132		302								I thought you knew...	133																						
133	133		302								It's alright. No one is around.	134	It's alright. I'm the only one here.	134																				
134	134		301								Karenina	It's not alright! How stupid are you?!	1																					
135	135		401						200	1	1515																							
136	136		204							1	4																							
137	137		301									You want to say something more, but the supervisor from the conservation area suddenly calls you. Sounding urgent, he notifies you that the CPF has stopped working properly all of a sudden.																						
138	138		301								Karenina	...The wattage of the CPF dropped drastically out of nowhere? How the hell... I see. I'll be right there!	1																					
139	139		302								I'm coming with you!	140																						
140	140		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					You two place the things you have found in a cart, and then you make your way to the Central Purification Filter.
