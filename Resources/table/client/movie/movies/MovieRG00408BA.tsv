13	11		301									Pursued by the bionics, Evan falls into the snow. He fumbles around for rocks and hurls them hopelessly at the bionics.																						
14	12		301									The attacks are, of course, futile. The bionics only stagger for less than a split-second before they continue closing in on Evan.																						
15	13		301									But that split-second seems to have done the trick. A spear plummets from the sky and pierces a bionic's frame.

26	24		301									Leading around a dozen Forest Guard Constructs similar to her height and body shape, Rosetta and the others brace their spears and rush the bionics in a V-shaped formation.
