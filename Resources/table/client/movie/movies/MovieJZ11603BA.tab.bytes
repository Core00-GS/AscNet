12	12		301								Changyu	Drawn by yours truly! I've marked every inch of the boat that I could set foot on, so this should be pretty accurate.	1																					
13	13		301									Changyu takes his pencil and circles the spot marked "Trade Fair," then continues drawing along a series of crooked passageways all across the deck until it reaches the edge of the Nighter.																						
14	14		301								Changyu	This is my next target.	1																					
15	15		301								Huainan	The Trade Fair?	2

20	19		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Changyu and Huainan follow their guide to the dimly lit laboratory underground.																						
21	20		301									Shabby as the place may be, the constant humming from the equipment and the rows of test tubes filled with colorful liquids have made this already tiny space uncomfortably oppressive.																						
22	21		201							1	500236																							
23	22		301							1	Guide	It's up ahead. You can talk to the doctor yourself.	1

29	28		301									Changyu takes stock of the strange surroundings and mutters to Huainan.																						
30	29		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Changyu	And I thought you were going to stop me.	2

37	36		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Huainan	Why Akdilek?	2																					
38	37		301								Changyu	For justice.	1																					
39	38		301								Huainan	Bullshit.	2																					
40	39		301								Changyu	Fine, I just wanted to know how you'd react. You've got a history with them, don't you?	1																					
41	40		301								Huainan	...I'm not ready to talk about myself.	2																					
42	41		301								Changyu	That's alright. I wasn't probing.	1																					
43	42		301								Changyu	But I'm serious about Adeilek. I've done some digging‚Äîthey're looking for live bodies on the boat, those that can be refitted into Constructs. I think I can make a score from it.	1																					
44	43		301								Changyu	And now's your chance to stop me.	1																					
45	44		301								Huainan	Will it work?	2																					
46	45		301								Changyu	Of course!	1																					
47	120		204							1	1																							
48	47		301								Changyu	We are partners!	1																					
49	48		301									Changyu's eyes glinted with fervency and sincerity.																						
50	46		301									Huainan saw himself reflected in them. He paused for a moment, then pushed his hair aside, revealing a horrendous scar on his neck.																						
51	49		301									Even concealed behind his collar, the swollen crimson mark on his neck was still clearly visible. It wound and weaved on Huainan's skin, crawling and slithering.																						
52	50		301								Huainan	This is my quarrel with Akdilek.	2																					
53	130		204							1	5																							
54	51		301								Changyu	...?!	1																					
55	52		301									Huainan straightened his coat and hid the awful scar.																						
56	53		301								Huainan	I'm not stopping you.	2																					
57	54		301								Huainan	But I need to know where your information's coming from. Can you trust them?	2																					
58	55		301								Changyu	Their reputation precedes them in the black market. Spend a little money and grease some wheels, and nothing's hidden under the sun.	1																					
59	56		301								Huainan	Meddling right under their noses, huh?	2																					
60	57		301								Changyu	Here's my plan‚ÄîI'll pretend to be one of the merchandise, and after Akdilek purchases this remarkable body, I'll escape with their money and leave them empty-handed.	1																					
61	58		204							1	1																							
62	59		301								Changyu	Just trust me.	1																					
63	60		301								Huainan	Akdilek wants bodies that are suited to be Constructs. Do you even fit the requirement? Or are you forging your data?	2																					
64	61		301								Changyu	The secret to a well-planned scheme is to not plan everything. You have to follow the ebb and flow of the plot, manipulating it the way you do water, guiding it just enough so it flows where you want it.	1																					
65	62		301								Huainan	What are you... Is this your third lesson?	2																					
66	63		301								Changyu	What? No! The third lesson is "don't trust strangers." But‚Äîyou must trust your partner unequivocally.	1																					
67	64		301								Huainan	...I know a place. They can check if your body's suitable to be refitted.	2																					
68	65		204							2																								
69	66		301								Huainan	Doctors like that are a dime a dozen on the black market. I happen to know one who'll do anything for the right price.	2																					
70	67		301								Changyu	So you...	1																					
71	68		301								Huainan	Let's go.	2																					
72	69		204							1																								
73	70		301								Changyu	Huh?	1																					
74	71		301								Huainan	I never said I'm sitting this one out.	2																					
75	72		301								Huainan	Maybe I can tell you something about me after this.	2

83	80		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Huainan	Are you listening? Changyu?	2																					
84	81		301								Changyu	What is it? I wasn't paying attention.	1																					
85	82		301								Huainan	...Sigh. Focus this time.	2																					
86	83		301								Huainan	Now, you should be familiar with our damn collars. Everyone on this boat has one around their neck.	2																					
87	84		301								Huainan	It serves two functions. First of all, it's a way to remotely control us. Even if it's only indirectly, the two primary commands coded in the collar mean we can't leave the Nighter, and we can't harm it.	2																					
88	85		301								Huainan	It's also our ID. The collars on this boat have records of all bodies onboard the Nighter‚Äîliving, Construct, mechanoid.	2																					
89	86		301									Changyu traces the collar on his neck. Of course he knows of it, but he has never really considered what its existence means.																						
90	87		301									He has lived the same routine on this boat as far as he can recall, for... three months, a year‚Äîor three? He has no recollection, and he can never quite put his finger on it. Everything just... happened.																						
91	88		301								Huainan	One human, one set of corresponding data. Including that person's Tantalum-193 affinity.	2																					
92	89		301								Changyu	Tantalum-193 affinity?	1																					
93	90		301								Huainan	Only those with high enough Tantalum-193 affinity can be refitted into Constructs.	2																					
94	91		301								Huainan	Assuming somewhere on this boat is a person with the desired Tantalum-193 affinity, someone who's not associated with the "official merchandise" from the Kowloong Crew‚Äî	2																					
95	92		301								Huainan	That's who Akdilek is after. That's the leverage we need.	2																					
96	93		301								Changyu	So, we have to figure out if we are merchandise-material to begin with...	1																					
97	94		301								Huainan	That's right. It'll be so much easier if we can just be a part of the wares on display. But if we can't do that, we can still get what we're after here.	2																					
98	95		301								Changyu	How come you know all of this so well?	1																					
99	951		204							1	5																							
100	96		301								Huainan	The worst thing we can face on this boat is uncertainty, don't you think?	2

103	99		301							1	Black Market Doctor	Are you the one?	1																					
104	100		301									The two young men are interrupted by the approaching surgeon. His face may be concealed by a mask, but it is clear that his eyes are keenly examining Changyu.																						
105	101		301								Black Market Doctor	Follow me.	1
