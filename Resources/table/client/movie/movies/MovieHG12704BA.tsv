6	6		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You feel the soft mattress on your back. The pendant lamp above you sways from the breeze.																						
7	7		302								Hello, ceiling, my old friend.	8

11	11		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After the trial of the carousel, you feel calmer with the other attractions that Nanami modified.																						
12	12		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory194.png																								
13	13		301									After all, all the rollercoaster does is fly off the rail after climbing to its peak before diving straight toward the lava on the ground.																						
14	14		302								(No big deal.)	15																						
15	15		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory197.png																								
16	16		301									As you suspect, the Ferris wheel cabin Nanami and you are in drops into a free fall after reaching its highest point.																						
17	17		301									Then it bounces back tens of thousands of meters into the sky with the help of a magnetic launcher before disassembling mid-air and sending you into a free fall once again.																						
18	18		302								(We'll call it parachuting practice.)	19																						
19	19		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory527.png																								
20	20		301									The horror-themed haunted house sends you a madman in an ice hockey mask who chases you all over the park with a machete from dawn till dusk.																						
21	21		302								(It's part of the immersive experience.)	22																						
22	22		301									With Nanami's meticulous planning, you eventually experience all the attractions with her.																						
23	23		201							1	500038	1

25	25		204							1																								
26	26		301								Nanami	But time passes so quickly...	1																					
27	27		301									The barefoot Nanami sits on the mossed ledge of the fountain, her feet swinging, kicking up sprays of water.																						
28	28		301									The splashes glisten as the lights from the pool meet the setting sun within the droplets, and they look like exquisite gemstones, or perhaps the many lights of the city at night.																						
29	29		301								Nanami	Are you sure you don't want to get your feet wet, Commandant? It's so refreshing!	1																					
30	30		301									You shake your head, peeking at the warning sign standing next to the fountain—"Danger: High Voltage".																						
31	31		301								Nanami	Hmm... Cross this off the list...	1																					
32	32		301									Nanami takes out her holo-screen and crosses out another item.																						
33	33		301								Nanami	Well, that's it for today!	1																					
34	34		204							1	2																							
35	35		301								Nanami	I'll see you tomorrow, Commandant!	1																					
36	36		302								Tomorrow?	37																						
37	37		204							1	1																							
38	38		301								Nanami	There are still so many things Nanami wants to share with you! Like, this—many—	1																					
39	39		301									Nanami stretches her arms apart as much as possible as if trying to embrace the whole world.																						
40	40		204							1																								
41	41		301								Nanami	A day is not long enough for us, so we'll have to leave the rest for tomorrow.	1																					
42	42		301								Nanami	But don't you worry, Commandant. I already told you that time passes much faster here.	1																					
43	43		301								Nanami	We could even spend a lifetime here if we want!	1																					
44	44		302								That's too much!	45	That's problematic!	45																				
45	45		204							1	1																							
46	46		301								Nanami	Now, now, I was just joking!	1																					
47	47		204							1	2

49	49		204							1																								
50	50		301								Nanami	Hang out with Nanami, Commandant! For a few more days!	1																					
51	51		301								Nanami	I just want to complete my list!	1

60	60		301			DialogEnable						You resolve to take things as they come, waiting for someone to knock on the door or call you on the comms.																						
61	61		301									But no one shows up despite your wait. Suddenly, air raid sirens blare outside, rattling the windows...

74	74		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory538.png																								
75	75		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Afterward, Nanami keeps changing her role, and you grow accustomed to supporting her performances.																						
76	76		301									Sometimes, she is a superhero who saves people from disasters—																						
77	77		301									Mostly, she saves you, who proceed to experience over two thousand of these disasters.																						
78	78		301									Sometimes, she is an esteemed, selfless surgeon, asking nothing in return—																						
79	79		301									And you, the patient on the operating table, with your belly cut open by her chainsaw.																						
80	80		301									Sometimes, she is a wise professor, mentoring you despite how difficult you are being—																						
81	81		301									Correcting the many mistakes she spews in the lecture hall.																						
82	82		301									And it goes on...																						
83	83		301									Nanami keeps asking you questions along the way, recording every single detail: What is your favorite color and food? Summer or winter? Sugar in your coffee? Do you lift your left or right leg first when you walk?																						
84	84		301									The length of the records on her holo-screen soon surpasses her list.																						
85	85		301									Every time you two have gone through an experience, Nanami crosses out an item on that list. But you do not find the list getting any shorter after a few "days."																						
86	86		302								More like it's getting longer?	87																						
87	87		301									Nanami also notices it, starting to skip the middle parts and jumping straight to conclusions.																						
88	88		301									As if something is pressing her to finish these experiences as soon as possible.																						
89	89		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Rushing through these adventures, you have no idea how many roles you have played and how long you have spent with Nanami.

92	92		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Right now, the Nanami beside you looks like a young child.																						
93	93		201							1	500039																							
94	94		301							1	Nanami	Mom and Dad asked us to mow the lawn, Commandant!	1																					
95	95		302								Alright.	96																						
96	96		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryZhengyanNew.prefab	1																							
97	97		301									Just as you lay eyes on a garden full of weeds, your vision blurs for a second. When it clears again, you find a mowed lawn before you.																						
98	98		302								...	99																						
99	99		301								Nanami	Commandant, let's play with Mimi!	1

105	105		201							1	500039	1																						
106	106		301							1	Nanami	Let's plant these seeds, Commandant!	1

109	109		301								Nanami	Commandant?	1

113	113		204							1																								
114	114		301								Nanami	Yes...	1																					
115	115		301									She lowers her head, mumbling.																						
116	116		301									The girl before you looks drastically different than the one at the amusement park. The smile on her face is long gone, replaced by worry.																						
117	117		301									Noticing your gaze, Nanami reverts to her usual behaviors.																						
118	118		301								Nanami	It's Q&A time, Commandant! How much of Nanami's wishlist has been completed?	1																					
119	119		301									You recall the endless list on the screen—																						
120	120		302								We're not even 1 percent there, are we?	121																						
121	121		204							1	2																							
122	122		301								Nanami	Beep-beep! Wrong answer! It's 70 percent completed already!	1																					
123	123		204							1																								
124	124		301								Nanami	So, Commandant, will you indulge Nanami for one last day?	1																					
125	125		301								Nanami	I don't want to leave behind any regrets.	1																					
126	126		302								Nanami.	127																						
127	127		301								Nanami	Here!	1																					
128	128		302								We don't have to rush.	129																						
129	129		302								I'll always be by your side.	130																						
130	130		204							1	2																							
131	131		301								Nanami	You can't stay away from Nanami too? Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi, what should we do?	1																					
132	132		204							1																								
133	133		301								Nanami	We're both so busy, and there are things we must do.	1																					
134	134		302								I'm sure we'll have free time.	135																						
135	135		301								Nanami	But it won't be enough. Not as much as Nanami wants.	1																					
136	136		301								Nanami	And Commandant won't always be able to stay by Nanami's side...	1																					
137	137		301									Unlike Constructs, humans are bound by their age. There is no way for you to stay with someone forever.																						
138	138		302								I'll be there whenever you think about me.	139																						
139	139		301									Across time. Beyond death.																						
140	140		302								It's not quantity that makes our memories valuable.	141																						
141	141		301									Nanami looks into your eyes, not continuing your discussion. Despite the noon sunlight, her expression is more somber than the night.																						
142	142		301									You have a feeling that Nanami is withholding something from you. Perhaps you have misunderstood what she meant?																						
143	143		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Before you can say anything, the sun sets and the sky turns dark. You feel a sudden sense of acceleration.
