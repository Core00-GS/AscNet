3	3		301			DialogEnable						02:46 PM. Abandoned Dock, West Coast.																						
4	4		301									Recently, vandalized and adulterated supplies have repeatedly turned up in earthbound bases, prompting a request for Babylonia's assistance.																						
5	5		301									Seeing that most squads are occupied with their respective missions, this task is assigned to Gray Raven instead.																						
6	6		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Following a trail of clues, your team is led to an abandoned dock.

8	9		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You can taste the salt in the wind, the nighttime breeze weaving between the tiny shacks and structures. The arrival of the Gray Raven squad seems to have brought a rare hint of liveliness to the place.																						
9	10		201							1	500136																							
10	11		301							1	???	Your IDs?	1																					
11	12		301									A man in guard attire blocks your way forward.																						
12	13		201							1	500166																							
13	14		301							1	Lucia	Here.	1																					
14	15		301									Lucia hands him your prepared IDs. The guard takes a look at them and grunts.																						
15	16		201							1	500136																							
16	17		301							1	Dock Guard	Wait here.	1																					
17	18		301									He returns soon after with your identifications in hand.																						
18	19		301								Dock Guard	Bossman's asking for your tokens. These won't do—word got out about the IDs recently.	1																					
19	20		301									Word had gotten out, obviously, for none other than Gray Raven. You do not expect to be discovered so quickly and elicit such a swift response.																						
20	21		302								We weren't told about any token.	22	Your probably forgot to send us one.	22																				
21	22		301								Dock Guard	Everyone here was delivered one.	1																					
22	23		302								But you've only just found out about it!	24	You must have misplaced ours.	24																				
23	24		301								Dock Guard	Bossman said everyone was delivered one, so everyone was delivered one.	1																					
24	25		301									The guard puts his hand on his weapon, his eyes darting between the four of you. A fight will most definitely ensue should the Gray Ravens insist.																						
25	26		301								Dock Guard	Better leave now. No good to anyone if we fight.	1																					
26	27		302								...	28	(Can't alert them yet)	28																				
27	28		202							1					1																			
28	29		301									The Gray Ravens all back away and leave.																						
29	1029		201							1	500245																							
30	30		301									A sudden wave of onshore wind gusts through the crowded dock, lifting away the tattered hood of a passerby, revealing a pair of familiar eyes.																						
31	31		302								...Changyu?	32	...	33																				
32	32	34	301									The man standing next to the boy hears what you call him and turns to look at the cloaked young figure.																						
33	33		301									The man standing next to the boy notices your gaze. He stops and turns to look at the cloaked young figure.																						
34	34		201							1	500148																							
35	35		301							1	???	Do you know them?	1																					
36	36		201							1	500225	2																						
37	37		301							1		He grabs the boy by the collar. The sudden jolt yanks away the boy's hood, revealing a practiced and composed smile.																						
38	38		201							1	1031001	7																						
39	39		301							1	Liv	Chang—	1																					
40	40		204							1																								
41	41		301									Realizing that this is not the best time for a reunion, Liv abruptly stops.																						
42	42		201							1	500136																							
43	43		301							1	Dock Guard	Hey, no fighting! These folks don't have their tokens. How about you?	1																					
44	44		201							1	500225	1																						
45	45		301							1	Changyu	Of course we do! Loosen up, man. I gotta show him the thing.	1																					
46	46		301									The man lets go of Changyu. The two of them each take out an ancient coin that seemingly originates from Kowloong.																						
47	47		302								An ancient coin...	48	Looks Kowloong to me...	48																				
48	48		201							1	500166	5																						
49	49		301							1	Lucia	Looks like they're all associated with Kowloong.	1																					
50	50		301								Lucia	Perhaps they're left behind by the Nighter.	1																					
51	51		201							1	500136																							
52	52		301							1		The guard is busy inspecting the ancient coins, failing to notice what you are all whispering.																						
53	53		301								Dock Guard	Coins look right, but they're just for the two of you. What's their deal, then?	1																					
54	54		302								...	55																						
55	55		201							1	500225	2																						
56	56		301							1	Changyu	Oh well, I have no idea.	1																					
57	57		301									The guard and the cloaked man both look at Changyu in suspicion.																						
58	59		301								Changyu	C'mon, it's hard not to run into a few familiar faces, the way we business folks get around. Doesn't mean I've stuck my nose into everyone's "family matters," y'know?	1																					
59	60		302								Changyu...	61	...	61																				
60	61		204							1	14																							
61	62		301									Changyu turns to your group tongue-tied and frowns in frustration.																						
62	63		204							1	2																							
63	64		301								Changyu	Now, I've still got some business with my friend here. Let's talk some other time, cool?	1																					
64	65		201							1	500148																							
65	66		301							1	???	That better be true. If I found out you were lying, I'll—	1																					
66	67		201							1	500225	13																						
67	68		301							1	Changyu	Sure, sure—you'll doublecross us with your 200 inside men and blow our train to kingdom come, am I right?	1																					
68	69		301								Changyu	Just think about it. If someone from Akdilek was competent enough for a job like that, they wouldn't have sent me with you.	1																					
69	70		204							1	2																							
70	71		301									Changyu stands on his toes to match the man's height. He gives the cloaked figure a pat on the back, alongside a grin and a vial of serum.																						
71	72		301								Changyu	Here, take this. Nothing more calming than a shot of this, right? Now, this is your turf—care to show me the way?	1																					
72	73		201							1	500148																							
73	74		301							1	???	What about them?	1																					
74	75		201							1	500225	14																						
75	76		301							1		Changyu turns to your group again with the same frustrated look.																						
76	77		204							1	2																							
77	78		301								Changyu	I couldn't care less. They can take care of themselves.	1																					
78	79		202							1					1																			
79	80		301									A muffled thunder from behind the clouds is hinting at an upcoming storm. The Gray Ravens exchange glances with each other and, eventually, depart the abandoned dock.																						
80	82		201							1	500026																							
81	83		301							1	Lee	There goes our lead.	1																					
82	84		302								What do we do with Changyu?	87	The man next to Changyu seems to be threatening him.	87																				
83	85		301								Lee	Not that we can do anything right now. You heard the man with the bomb-rigged train, didn't you?	1																					
84	86		202							1					1																			
85	87		201							1	1031001		-400																					
86	88		201							2	500166		400																					
87	89		301							1	Liv	I'll look into the tokens and see if we can get ahold of them... Meanwhile, let's figure out a way to meet Changyu.	1																					
88	90		301								Lucia	Wait—I just got a message from him.	2																					
89	91		301								Lucia	"Meet me in my secret lair."	2																					
90	92		301								Liv	Secret lair?	1																					
91	93		301								Lucia	Hold on... He also attached a set of coordinates—of an underground warehouse 45km away.	2																					
92	94		302								Let's check it out.	95	There's nothing we can do here anyway.	95																				
93	95		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	You're right. Let's go.	2
