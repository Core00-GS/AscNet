3	3		301									Haicma wishes she could play the never-ending game of questions with Nanami once again as they did in that small room.																						
4	4		301									But she also knows that this Nanami is no longer the Nanami from the past... and Haicma herself is not who she once was either.																						
5	5		301									Now, Haicma is the Church of Machina's "Hermit"... and Nanami is the ultimate purpose they seek.

7	7		301							1	Nanami	Nanami understands all your fears and confusions because just like you... I've also seen the worst endings between machines and humans in countless futures.	1

14	14		301							1	Nanami	You're not wrong... perhaps nothing Nanami does means anything in the future. But some people still do their best, believing that the future can be changed one step at a time.	1

16	16		301									Looking at the blue planet that seems to be within reach, Nanami smiles tenderly.																						
17	17		301								Nanami	The humans that everyone thinks are weak are still fighting on Earth against endless despair with nothing but a trace of hope. Nanami will look so lame if she keeps running away!	1																					
18	18		301								Nanami	Nanami will try her best and do what she can... as a friend of humans and a sage of the awakened machines.	1																					
19	19		301								Nanami	I'm going to lead the machines to the future I've chosen, the future where machines and humans can love each other.	1

43	43		301									Even though you don't know me anymore, those memories have not faded a bit.																						
44	44		301									All her doubts and confusions crumble in an instant. Haicma finally understands why she has been resisting the "correct" future.																						
45	45		301									It is because that is not the future she wants. She wants Nanami to make a different choice. She wants the future to look different.

59	59		301								Nanami	In that case, nice to meet you, Haicma... and Lazer!																						
60	60		301								Trailblazer	Huh...? Am I Lazer...?																						
61	61		301								Haicma	You... remember my name?																						
62	62		301								Nanami	Yep! You're Nanami's friend, Haicma!																						
63	63		301									Even though Nanami's memories of Haicma from the past have been erased, Nanami remembers her from the future when they became friends.																						
64	64		301									Perhaps it is a coincidence, a bug in the infinite calculations—but Nanami and Haicma will always become friends regardless of which future comes true.																						
65	65		301								Haicma	Right... Haicma... is Nanami's friend.																						
66	66		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Haicma clutches Nanami's hand. This is her first promise to herself—but one of her infinite identical promises in the infinite timelines: she will always become Nanami's friend.

78	78		301								Nanami	But to make that dream come true, we're going to need everybody.	1
