49	47		301								Sophia	Aristocrats are born to be aristocrats. Asslam is a private train bought by our leader's grandfather.	2																					
50	48		301								Sophia	The aristocrats have been living in the Eternal Engine ever since it first started. They are the only ones who have access to private cabins.	2

58	56		301								Sophia	Ashlar represents the aristocrats. They have long planned for a trade like this to make themselves part of the Ascendants.	2																					
59	57		301								Sophia	So they can break away from this "unfree" life, where they have to share resources with the civilians.	2

64	62		301								Sophia	...That's why Leader came up with a safer alternative—to trade the "merchandise" for the right to live in Babylonia.	2																					
65	63		301								Lee	When you say "leader," do you mean Jamilah? Not Aston?	3																					
66	64		301								Sophia	Aston is only pretending to be an aristocrat to help Leader maintain the balance between classes.	2
