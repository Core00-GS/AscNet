13	13		301									Suddenly, a harsh buzzing comes from the main tower, drawing the attention of the crowd. Following the noise, the crowd notices Lady Qu and KCC officials standing at the top of the building.

15	15		301							1		Qu raises her hand slightly, projecting a screen above the plaza. The screen shows a map of the KCC. Outside of its boundaries, a dense stream of red lights approach the city.																						
16	16		301								Qu	As you can see, the Punishing Virus is encroaching upon Kowloong.	1

35	33		301								Qu	Therefore, we must stay in this city. Huaxu, the pinnacle of Kowloong's wisdom, has calculated a way for us to survive.	1																					
36	34		301								Qu	Huaxu's computing power enables us to store our consciousness in its database. No matter what happens in the real world, we can achieve immortality in a virtual world.	1																					
37	35		301								Qu	We will witness the rise and fall of countless civilizations. We will exist until the end of the planet's life.	1																					
38	36		301								Qu	According to Huaxu's calculations, the best solution to a world dominated by the Punishing Virus is—the Tabula Akasha.	1																					
39	37		301								Qu	However, the implementation of Tabula Akasha takes time. Based on the population, not everyone can complete the backup procedure before the Corrupted arrive. That is the inescapable reality of the situation.	1

48	43		301									The crowd falls silent. Without a doubt, the crowd could hear the deafening roar of the Corrupted.																						
49	44		301									An endless ocean of bullets and debris expands as far as the eye can see. The exoskeletons of fallen soldiers lay in fragments throughout the calamity, covering flesh and blood still fresh with heat.

68	56		301									The flames from the muzzle fire vents their anger, leaving an ocean of steel in the wake of their rage...																						
69	57		301									The Corrupted surge like waves, drowning all that stands in their way. Explosive rounds pierce the waves, sending ripples through the sea only to disperse as the waves surge forward again.
