6	6		301			DialogEnable				1	Lucia	What are those machines...? They don't look like any standard military hardware in our logs.	3																					
7	7		301								Lucia	I remember reading about some factions producing or modifying combat mechanoids before Constructs were developed to fight against the World Government's forces.	3																					
8	8		301								Lee	Perhaps, but these appear to predate that.	2																					
9	9		301								Lee	They even use non-spherical joints for locomotion.	2																					
10	10		301								Liv	The AI's design is also primitive... It's still based on finite-state core logic.	1																					
11	11		301								Lucia	I recall that in the early Post-Pandemic Age, machines constructed based on the combination of variable joints with negative spherical bearings and artificial musculature had made every other design obsolete...	3																					
12	12		204							2	10																							
13	13		301								Lee	In other words, this type of mechanoid was designed toward the end of the Golden Age.	2																					
14	14		204							2																								
15	15		301								Liv	You mean to say, this facility is like a museum for mechanoid designs during the Golden Age?	1																					
16	16		301								Lee	Why would someone bury it underground and attempt to hide it as an "X-class Facility"...	2																					
17	17		301								Lucia	...Standing here thinking isn't going to give us any answers. We won't know until we go inside.	3																					
18	18		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lee	You're right. Let's get going.	2

44	44		301								Liv	Did you... hear something?	1																					
45	45		301								Lucia	Is something wrong? I didn't hear anything.	3																					
46	46		301								Lee	Same here. I just did an enhanced scan within a 300-meter area.	2																					
47	47		301								Lee	But I didn't find anything. However, considering that Liv's Inver-Device has been specially enhanced, we can't rule out any potential digital noise leaked from poor signal blocking.	2																					
48	48		204							1																								
49	49		301								Liv	But... I've never heard anything like this before.	1																					
50	50		301								Liv	Not to mention, I could definitely discern a message... Champion... Blood... Beasts sealed in Heaven...	1																					
51	51		301								Lee	...What does that mean?	2																					
52	52		301								Lucia	Even meaningless noise can occasionally form coherent sentences. Let's continue onward.	3																					
53	53		301								Lucia	Science and technology make us far more perceptive than humans. But we should also accept the fact that some meaningless information has never been useful, and it still won't be in the future.	3																					
54	54		301								Liv	Right... right.	1																					
55	55		301								Lucia	But this indicates that Liv's radar is much more powerful than ours.	3																					
56	56		301								Lucia	Let's keep going, everyone.	3
