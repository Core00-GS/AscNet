3	3		301			DialogEnable						The slaughter lasted a whole night.																						
4	4		301									Of the 587 survivors who boarded the train before it departed, only 151 have survived. 23 Constructs remain, excluding those from the elite squads.																						
5	5		301									To rid the train of the Hetero-Creatures, they have launched three suicide bombings.																						
6	6		301									And yet, the lost lives and the destroyed tracks have traded but a brief moment of peace. A new wave of enemies quickly surrounds them again.																						
7	7		301									By the time the haunting nightmare disappears from their sights, and the blood no longer paints an unending line along the tracks, it is already 2 pm of the next day.																						
8	8		301									Shielded by a devastating amount of casualties, the people finally managed to get some breathing room.																						
9	9		301									But everyone who has endured the night knows full well that they have survived only because the twins have almost not participated in the fights at all.																						
10	10		301									They are still in danger.																						
11	11		201							1	500419																							
12	12		301							1	Watanabe	How far are the twins from us currently?	1

14	14		201							2	500416		400																					
15	15		301							1	Lee	The geolocation feedback suggests that they are about 130 kilometers away, which would take them at least 9 minutes to catch up, even with their speed. But I can't promise that this isn't delayed information.	1																					
16	16		301								Lucia	Only nine minutes...	2																					
17	17		202							1	2				1																			
18	18		301									Inside the broken carriage, the survivors are patching themselves up in tears.																						
19	19		301									Most of the 151 survivors are only lightly wounded—which indicates the unfortunate fact that none of those who were hurt badly lived.																						
20	20		301									Just as the train cannot stop, these people cannot afford to stop and grieve. They know full well that, should they pause and mourn the departed, they will likely be the next ones lost.																						
21	21		201							1	500225																							
22	22		301							1	Changyu	We're almost at our destination. We should come up with a plan first.	1																					
23	23		203							1	0.25	-400																						
24	24		201							2	500416		400																					
25	25		301							1	Lucia	That's right. We have to find a way to get the survivors off the train as quickly as possible.	2																					
26	26		301								Changyu	Everyone's injured, so they ought to be moving slower. Leaving the station in nine minutes is the best we can hope for.	1																					
27	27		301									Changyu pauses, withholding what he is about to say. Still, everyone understands what he is trying to point out.																						
28	28		301									"Most are only lightly wounded" does not mean that everyone is only slightly injured. Not to mention that they cannot guarantee the "lightly wounded" would be able to evacuate from the station in a mere nine minutes.

30	30		201							2	500127	9	-400																					
31	31		301							1	Chrome	We still have 5 people in critical condition.	1																					
32	32		301								Sophia	Jamilah is also badly hurt. I'll take her with me.	2																					
33	33		201							1	500416		-400																					
34	34		201							2	500225		400																					
35	35		301							1	Lucia	And you, Changyu?	1																					
36	36		301								Changyu	I'll go with Jamilah too. There will be a lot of fights on the way, for sure. Seeing that we don't have any medics here, we can only take one more.	2

38	38		201							1	500419																							
39	39		301							1	Watanabe	We've lost too much already.	1																					
40	40		301									After a whole night of loss, the light in Watanabe's pupils is almost gone. The corners of his eyes are still tinted light red—is it tears? Perhaps sweat, or blood? Or could it be a painful mixture of them all?																						
41	41		203							1	0.25	-400																						
42	42		201							2	500418		400																					
43	43		301							1	Chrome	We're still a while away from the station, Watanabe. You need to rest and repair so you can keep fighting.	2																					
44	44		301								Watanabe	I'm fine.	1																					
45	45		301									He shakes his head.																						
46	46		301								Watanabe	We're so close. We have to get everyone out safely... that's the only way they don't die in vain.	1																					
47	47		301									What was intended to be a word of comfort has only made him frown even more.																						
48	48		301								Chrome	Will you go with them? You know City 210 better than us. You'll be a better guide.	2																					
49	49		301								Watanabe	Of course.	1																					
50	50		301								Watanabe	I'll try to bring some of the seriously wounded as well. Leave Shrek and the rest to me.	1																					
51	51		201							1	500416		-400																					
52	52		201							2	500417		400																					
53	53		301							1	Lucia	Is anyone also going? The people with light wounds will need Constructs' assistance to travel to safety in nine minutes.	1																					
54	54		301								Lee	Hold on. If the twins realize that the crowd is no longer here, they will change their target, and we'll be looking at even heavier casualties.	2																					
55	55		202							1	2				1																			
56	56		201							1	500019																							
57	57		301							1	Construct 1	No way—our mission is to be the target of the Hetero-Creatures and the twins?	1																					
58	58		301									No one objected to Chrome's plan two days ago when they had yet to face the barrage of enemies.																						
59	59		301									But now, most of them just want to leave this grueling frontline.																						
60	60		201							1	500416	5																						
61	61		301							1	Lucia	We'll meet with Babylonia's Support Force in City 210 and get the prototype weapon.	1																					
62	62		301								Lucia	But to deploy the Omega Prototype, we have to make sure that the enemies are still following us.	1																					
63	63		301								Lucia	It's too dangerous to be at close range with them. I think it's safer to do it on the train.	1																					
64	64		201							1	500225																							
65	65		301							1	Changyu	Before she passed out last night, Jamilah mentioned that if you're going to use the train for your operation, we'll give Lee access permission.	1																					
66	66		301								Changyu	Of course—she also mentioned that we'd be sending Babylonia a bill for all the damage caused.	1																					
67	67		201							1	500019																							
68	68		301							1	Construct 1	...Fine.	1																					
69	69		301									The loss suffered in the prior night has everyone deeply traumatized. They are struggling to be optimistic even when they can see the light at the end of the tunnel.																						
70	70		203							1	0.25	-400																						
71	71		201							2	500418		400																					
72	72		301							1	Chrome	Perhaps we should let everyone choose.	2																					
73	73		301									Instead of encouragement, Chrome chooses a different path.																						
74	74		301								Construct 1	Let everyone choose...? You mean you're letting us decide if we stay or go?	1																					
75	75		301								Chrome	That's right. Please pass the word and ask what everyone thinks.	2																					
76	76		301								Construct 1	I will.	1																					
77	77		301									Without delay, the Construct drags his wounded leg further inside the carriage.																						
78	78		202							1	2				1																			
79	79		201							1	500419																							
80	80		301							1	Watanabe	I'll help them prepare for the move as well.	1																					
81	81		201							1	500416	5																						
82	82		301							1	Lucia	Okay.	1																					
83	83		202							1					1																			
84	84		301									Watanabe and the Construct Soldier leave the cart.																						
85	85		201							1	500225																							
86	86		301							1	Changyu	Do you really think that some of them would choose to stay? I say most folks would care more about their own survival.	1																					
87	87		203							1	0.25	-400																						
88	88		201							2	500418		400																					
89	89		301							1	Chrome	I do. Neither of the choices guarantees safety.	2																					
90	90		301								Chrome	If we force them on the more dangerous path, their resolve will only waver.	2																					
91	91		201							1	500417		-400																					
92	92		301							1	Lee	Seems like we have to prepare a backup plan. What do we do if the twins don't follow the train?	1																					
93	93		201							2	500416	5	400																					
94	94		301							1	Lucia	We'll split up into small teams. The moment they deviate from our planned route, we'll initiate attacks like we did before to catch their attention.	2																					
95	95		301								Lee	It'll be easier to draw the enemies to us if we can provoke some of them.	1																					
96	96		301								Lucia	Right. Let's work out the details.	2																					
97	97		201							1	500418		-400																					
98	98		301							1	Chrome	I'll guard the people as they go.	1																					
99	99		201							1	500417		-400																					
100	100		301							1	Lee	I still have an EMP disruptor. After we get the Omega Prototype, we can use the prototype to catch the Corrupted's attention before deploying the disruptor.	1																					
101	101		301								Lucia	Good.	2																					
102	102		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	We must be ready. This battle will decide the fate of all our lives.	2
