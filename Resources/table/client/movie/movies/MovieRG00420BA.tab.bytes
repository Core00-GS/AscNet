51	51		301								Staessen	Materials that had to be transferred through Kyaranta will now be delivered directly to you.		1																				
52	52		301								Staessen	So, we need to give the settlement a new name.		1

62	62		301							1	Antonov	Yes, we traveled from the capital city of Sophia to the Arctic region before finally ending up here.	2																					
63	63		301								Antonov	One of the few things we still remember, is the meaning of our capital, "Sophia".	2																					
64	64		301								Sergey	‚ÄîIt means "Gift from Heaven".	1																					
65	65		301									You and Sergey say it at almost the same time.

83	83		301									Festive jubilation spreads throughout the crowd as the campfire and music fade outwards from the settlement.																						
84	84		301									The problems of the world will not be resolved from this small victory. But, at least, for tonight, the light from the campfire is joined by the sound of people singing.																						
85	85		301									Among the malt aroma of kvass and the merry singing, you seem to hear the faint sounds of cracking coming from the distant snowfield.																						
86	86		301									The cracking snowfield is said to symbolize the end of winter. Live through another cold snap, and the snow will melt, spring beginning anew.																						
87	87		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Although you have never seen a snowfield in spring, you know that it‚Äîwill soon come.
