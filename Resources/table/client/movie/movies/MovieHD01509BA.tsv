3	3		301			DialogEnable						After a brief exchange of information, the players begin to discuss their next step in the safe house.																						
4	4		301									At this moment, Gray Raven already has one of the parts required for the Ancient Triangle, "Soulless Body". The Heroes' Journal also explains how to get the other two.

6	6		301							1	Teddy	So our priority right now is to find the remaining Twin Souls in the artifact chamber, right?	1

8	8		301							1	Kamui	Are we going back there? I think the people there already remember our looks...	1

10	10		301							1	Chrome	I don't think we can break through so many soldiers with sheer force.	1																					
11	11		301								Chrome	Besides, Flawless Rope is outside the capital. I think the best plan is...	1																					
12	12		201							1	500494	13																						
13	13		301							1	Karenina	Teddy and I will head to the artifact chamber. We'll just try to avoid the guards. Strike Hawk and Gray Raven can go get that flawless-thing back.	1																					
14	14		301								Karenina	Since we are going to infiltrate the chamber, we don't need many members. Besides, we don't have information about the other side, so we should allocate more forces there.	1																					
15	15		201							1	500155																							
16	16		301							1	Chrome	I see... What do you say, Gray Raven Commandant?	1																					
17	17		302								That plan sounds good.	18	I think we should let someone else do it.	18

19	19		301							1	Teddy	Don't worry, this may sound incredible, but Karenina and I actually work together alright.	1																					
20	20		301								Teddy	Kamui also mentioned there were many enemies and it would be impossible to break through. Sending four members would only hinder the operation. We are stealing something after all.	1

24	24		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Most of the gate guards have been taken away by the officer and are still sleeping in a corner of the city.																						
25	25		301									The remaining guards are too busy to notice a few players crossing the wall... Who even complains about the lack of wall maintenance and how slippery it is?																						
26	26		301									Seeing Strike Hawk and Gray Raven have got out of the city, Karenina and Teddy fall back to the alley. Using the clock tower's chime as cover, they disappear into the shadow of buildings.																						
27	27		301									As always, everything is going very smoothly, just like what Ayla has witnessed in the past.
