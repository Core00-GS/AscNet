6	6		301			DialogEnable				1	Lee	Frankly, I can't tell how that trial is related to wisdom at all.	3																					
7	7		301								Lucia	But it was pretty fun as an activity. Liv and I were guessing along as well.	2																					
8	8		301								Lee	...Were all the gesturings you guys were doing just you trying to solve the puzzles?	3																					
9	9		301								Lucia	That's right. I got distracted for a second, and Liv won in the end.	2																					
10	1000		302								Should we give Liv a reward, then?	10	Do you want a rematch next time, Lucia?	11																				
11	10	12	301								Liv	Oh, I... I don't need any rewards... Lee and Commandant winning is the best reward I can hope for.	1																					
12	11	12	301								Lucia	I'll do my best if there is a rematch.	2																					
13	12		301								Lee	Anyway, we've got two keys with us now. It also proves the importance of finding out whose portrait it is.	3

17	1003		302								Why are you here?	14	What's up?	15																				
18	14	4000	301								Foreman	Not that odd for me to hang around the place. I'm part of the crew, after all! But you're right that I'm here for another reason.	1																					
19	15	4000	301								Foreman	Something's up! But you ain't the one I'm looking for.	1

22	16		301							1		After greeting you all, the foreman walks over to the South General, who is disappointed with the riddle having been solved, and smacks him on the back of the head.																						
23	17		301			PanelActor2Shake					South General	Ouch! What was that, Foreman?!	2																					
24	18		301							1	Foreman	Do you still have to ask? What are you doing leaving your post and coming all the way here? Look at that mess of a queue outside with all those mechanoids!	1																					
25	19		301								South General	Ugh!	2																					
26	20		301								Foreman	Just pick yourself up and head back, or the event's screwed!	1																					
27	21		301								South General	U-understood!	2

34	23		301							1	Foreman	I have to thank you as well, Babylonians.	2																					
35	24		301								Lucia	Why?	1																					
36	25		301								Foreman	Because y'all are great contestants, that's why! The Fist of the Taoist has never been as competitive as this year, thanks to you!	2																					
37	26		301								Lucia	Now that you've mentioned it, there were indeed mechanoids cheering for us, just like an audience.	1																					
38	27		301								Foreman	The competition is an event, after all.	2

40	28		301							1	Liv	But why are you organizing these activities during the Ghost Festival? The festival in the records is supposed to be...	1																					
41	29		301								Foreman	Of course we know what the Ghost Festival is supposed to be. We're just... trying to find an excuse to do something together, is what it is.	2																					
42	1011		302								Can't you do that in your daily lives?	30	Just to fool around?	31																				
43	30	32	301								Foreman	The lives of us mechanoids are way more boring than you think.	2																					
44	31	32	301								Foreman	That's a good way to put it.	2																					
45	32		301								Foreman	Which is to say... sometimes we would want to remember the good ol' days too.	2																					
46	33		301								Liv	These old days you're talking about...	1																					
47	34		301								Foreman	Hmm, weird to talk about this sort of thing in front of guests, ain't it? Trek along now to find the West General. I should return to my patrol!	2

49	35		301								Liv	And he's gone...	1

51	36		301							1	Lucia	From what Foreman said, this event shouldn't be dangerous to begin with. Let's keep going, Commandant.	2																					
52	1014		302								Let's go.	37	Lucia's next, right?	38																				
53	37		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	(Nods) Let's head toward the Western trial.	2																					
54	38		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	(Nods) We don't have anyone else, anyway. Let's go get our third victory!	2
