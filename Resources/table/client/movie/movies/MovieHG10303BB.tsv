4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Liv	I've selected the appropriate program based on the criteria.	1																					
5	5		302								From your previous questions?	6	What kind of training is it?	7																				
6	6		301								Liv	That's right. It's more effective choosing this way.	1																					
7	7		301								Liv	What we'll be doing today is the first step of the training programâ€”thinking exercise.	1																					
8	8		302								Thinking exercise?	10	It sounds very philosophical.	9																				
9	9		301								Liv	It's just a name. The training itself is still fairly practical.	1																					
10	10		301								Liv	Despite its name, what we're actually working on is tactical thinking as well as improvisational skills.	1																					
11	11		301								Liv	Many different circumstances during battles could cause us to disconnect from you, Commandant.	1																					
12	12		301								Liv	Which means the duty to continue our mission and protect ourselves would lie on us.	1																					
13	13		301								Liv	Unlike Lucia and Lee, I'm not very skilled in this aspect.	1																					
14	14		301								Liv	Sometimes I'd even misjudge the situation like when I opened fire last time... If only I...	1																					
15	15		302								Don't get brought down by what happened.	16	I should have given you instructions as well.	17																				
16	16	18	301								Liv	As Constructs, we are not allowed to fail.	1																					
17	17		301								Liv	It wasn't your fault, Commandant. I was weak.	1																					
18	18		301								Liv	Regardless, all you have to do during the training is to come up with the problems and grade me on how I act, Commandant.	1																					
19	19		301								Liv	I'll get through whatever obstacles that come up myself... Commandant, please just stand aside and watch.	1																					
20	20		302								Will do.	21	Are you sure?	22																				
21	21		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	Let's begin!	1																					
22	22		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	I am! I'll do my best!	1
