18	18		301								Yakov	Apparently, the ARU is taking in refugees from the riots. I found some leftover supplies on the way back... It's enough to last us on our way to Murmansk.	1

25	25		301									My footsteps got heavier with each step, and my body feels like it's on fire. The snowfield before me seemed to expand indefinitely and my vision began to blur.

31	31		301								Refugee Discussion	"She is the daughter of a sinner..."																						
32	32		301									..."Sinner".																						
33	33		301									Since they failed to meet the needs of the people, failed to obtain more supplies, failed to stop the power station from exploding, and failed to bring joy to everyone in the face of disasterâ€”they were labeled as "sinners".																						
34	34		301									In the beginning, they just stood there as silent onlookers, but they were the first to blame others for problems. They labeled others as "sinners", as if it kept them pure.																						
35	35		301									Are they really who Daddy wanted to protect?																						
36	36		301									My vision begins to fade, and all I can hear are footsteps in the snow. No one bothered to stop; they only moved onward in silence.																						
37	37		301								Refugee Discussion	Is that the ARU's armed forces up ahead?! We're saved!																						
38	38		301									Everyone erupted into noise. The crowd seemed to divide into two groups, as if they were making way for someone.

46	46		301							1	Pfaff	Understood. The ARU has made arrangements to take refugees to the central region first.	1
