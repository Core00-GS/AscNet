4	4		301									"Take care of yourself."																						
5	5		301									Changyu's head is abuzz with the horrid cries and clashes in his dreams. The screams taunt him, haunt him... until even the noises turn quiet, and all that remains is the last word of a pointless fight.																						
6	6		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Changyu's pupils dilate as he falls to the ground by his friend, the last thing in his sight being a group of medical personnel with tranquilizers in their hands slowly approaching.

9	10		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The smell of gasoline is what wakes Changyu.																						
10	11		301									He lets out a quiet moan, struggling to shake off the effect of the tranquilizer. He tries to blink, only to find cold, apathetic fluorescent light bathing over him.																						
11	12		301									This is not the Nighter. Every inch of this space screams indifference. The deep, roaring waves of the ocean are replaced by the heavy, persistent clanking of an engine.																						
12	13		301								???	You're awake.																						
13	14		301								Changyu	This is...																						
14	15		301									The person standing by Changyu wears a clean, tailored suit, donning the carved face of a Westerner.																						
15	16		301								Changyu	...Akdilek?																						
16	17		301								Akdilek Personnel	Perceptive. You're on the commoner carriage of Asslam, Changyu. You've been traded to us as merchandise.																						
17	18		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Changyu	What...

19	21		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Changyu stands up and looks at the strange interior of a train. He has never been on a train before. It does not feel different from the Nighter.																						
20	22		301									He takes a step forward to the massive floor-to-ceiling window in front of him. He finds his expression reflected on the filthy glass window, and he finds the sight beyond the window reflected in his eyes.																						
21	23		301								Changyu	The collar...																						
22	24		301									Changyu's fingers gently brush over his neck, but they find nothing where the collar once was.																						
23	25		301									It is such a foreign yet familiar feeling.																						
24	26		301									The train is plowing ahead at full speed. The scenery outside turns into blurry trails of orange lights, as if fireworks have exploded right next to Asslam, beautiful and dazzling.																						
25	27		301									...Until Changyu realizes where the orange glows come from.																						
26	28		301								Changyu	They are—																						
27	29		301									Crawling all over the ruins in the distance are thirsting, trembling Corrupted, staring and chasing after the bellowing vehicle.																						
28	30		301									No longer the flickering phantoms in his dreams, these are real, crazed monsters created by the Punishing Virus on their way to swallow the planet whole.																						
29	31		301									There is no wonderland or paradise out there. There is only death and uncaring cold.																						
30	32		301									Collapsed buildings. Ravaging beasts. Overwhelming darkness.																						
31	33		301									This is hell—the end of days—the real world, the truth that houses Changyu.																						
32	34		301									Changyu has never felt so small.																						
33	35		301									Never felt so afraid, so curious, so truthful... so thrilled.																						
34	36		301									His new understanding attacks his senses violently, washing over him like an endless waterfall. Changyu meets the crushing tide valiantly as he steadily stands, accepting the weight of this new burden.

39	41		301								Akdilek Personnel	Changyu, as protocol stated, you will be joining Akdilek as a Construct combatant on standby.																						
40	70		301								Akdilek Personnel	You will be given time to adjust to life on this train. You will learn the principal tenets, then you will begin training. All, of course, in preparation for you to be refitted into a Construct.																						
41	42		301								Akdilek Personnel	That said, you still have a choice.																						
42	43		301								Akdilek Personnel	The rumors spread on the Nighter are all baseless accusations. We are not some dark cults that terrorize and bully people.																						
43	44		301								Akdilek Personnel	But they were useful rumors. Taking advantage of your public perception is a fundamental lesson all businessmen must learn. Our predicament, for example, has led us to you.																						
44	45		301								Akdilek Personnel	You have potential. As a fighter... and a companion, one that we can count on.																						
45	46		301								Akdilek Personnel	We will not force you to stay here, so this is your one chance to choose. Stay here at Akdilek and fight with us, or return to the Nighter.																						
46	47		301								Akdilek Personnel	I'm sure you will figure out the rest.																						
47	48		301								Akdilek Personnel	Welcome to Asslam.																						
48	49		301									Something among those words has snapped Changyu out of his dissociating numbness.																						
49	50		204							1	5																							
50	51		301								Changyu	Where is Huainan?	1																					
51	52		301								Akdilek Personnel	So, your first concern is your companion's whereabouts?																						
52	53		301								Changyu	How do you—forget it. Where is he?	1																					
53	54		301								Akdilek Personnel	We have done our research on you. As for your companion, I too admire his capability—if only he were still alive.																						
54	65412		301								Akdilek Personnel	The Kowloong Crew has declared death penalties for those who violated the regulations of the Trade Fair. All bodies have sunk to the bottom of the ocean.																						
55	55		301								Changyu	...	1																					
56	56		301								Akdilek Personnel	If you decide to stay, you will learn that tragedies like this happen all over the world every day.																						
57	80		301								Akdilek Personnel	Everyone tries to break the bonds that hold them, only to find themselves stepping into a larger cage. Even the people pulling the strings cannot view the whole picture.																						
58	57		301								Akdilek Personnel	But you... You are not afraid of the uncertainty, aren't you? You are... ecstatic.																						
59	58		301								Akdilek Personnel	That's good. "She" will like you.																						
60	59		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Akdilek Personnel	We can use new blood like you.

63	62		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Changyu closes his eye. He does not wish to answer or argue. He shows no emotions, even though the slight twitch at the corner of his mouth may have betrayed him.																						
64	63		301								Changyu	...Understood.	1

68	67		301			DialogEnable						Changyu takes a deep breath. Then he opens his eyes and straightens his back, his unyielding expressions invoking that of someone he once knew.																						
69	68		301								Changyu	In that case, Akdilek, how can I be of service?																						
70	69		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Outside, night has reluctantly retreated. It will be a while before the next stretch of darkness arrives.
