3	3		301			DialogEnable						After searching for a moment, Vera uncovers a secret door behind a huge bookcase.																						
4	4		301									They quickly break down the bookcase and open the access point.																						
5	5		301									A mildewy odor of rotting paper comes out from the depths of the corridor. No. 21 sniffs the odor... then sneezes quietly.

11	11		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The two of them proceed along the corridor into the underground archive.

14	14		301							1	Vera	All the files here are kept on paper... Watch your step. Don't break anything.	1																					
15	15		301								No. 21	Okay.	2																					
16	16		202							1	2				1																			
17	17		301									The underground archive is considerably more cramped than the upper level. Stacks of sallow documents are piled on the ground, smelling of mildew.																						
18	18		301									No. 21 wrinkles her nose, sniffing the odor in an attempt to remember this peculiar smell.

24	24		301									Vera goes straight to the safe in the middle of the archive. She jams her blade into the lock and, after wiggling it several times, hears a satisfying click as it opens. She opens the safe and takes out a stack of documents from within.																						
25	25		301									Her eyes shift to the "TOP SECRET" written in bold red on a file and checks the date on one of the corners.																						
26	26		301									After confirming the other documents, she takes the entire stack and stuffs them into a sealed waterproof pouch.

31	31		301								No. 21	...There's a bug.																						
32	32		301									No. 21 is huddled over a dead spider lying on its back, trying to sniff it.																						
33	33		201							1	500168																							
34	34		301							1	Vera	First off, that's not a bug. And if you like it so much, there's a billion others in our basement back at HQ. You can spend the night there if you want...	1

36	36		301								No. 21	Really? Okay.																						
37	37		201							1	500168

45	45		301									No. 21 stands up. The two walk toward the exit, but right as the pouch containing the documents crosses the threshold, an ear-piercing alarm begins to buzz. Suddenly, the floor beneath them begins to rumble faintly.

50	50		301									Vera lifts up the pouch and looks up to see a faint optical scanner at the exit.																						
51	51		301								Vera	...Damn it! It's a trap!	1																					
52	52		301								No. 21	What should we do?	2																					
53	53		301								Vera	Run as fast you can! We need to get the hell outta hereâ€”!	1
