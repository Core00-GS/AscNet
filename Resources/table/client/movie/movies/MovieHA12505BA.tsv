4	4		301									After a long period of zero gravity, Selena feels her toes touching the ground.																						
5	5		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					It is the wooden floor of the Babylonia opera house, a feel that she cannot be more familiar with. She has stepped on it numerous times, spilling traces of joy, longing, apprehension, uncertainty and sweat.

9	9		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The familiar sight is split in two in front of her.																						
10	10		301									Her left eye reflects a ruined world, while her right eye sees splendor.																						
11	11		301									She hears half of herself chanting alone amidst the broken walls. But this is not right; the Babylonia opera house has never been caught in a war and should not be in this state.																						
12	12		301									From nowhere comes a sticky sound of tides. She cannot locate the source of the sound as it moves far and near.																						
13	13		301									Where is... this place?																						
14	14		301									The vision in left eye quietly changes as if it is answering to her question.																						
15	15		301									The broken pillars are reattached, the sacred sculptures restored, the peeling murals enriched with color again. The heavenly light pours down from the dome right in front of her.																						
16	16		301									She hesitantly steps into the light.

19	19		301							1		All of a sudden, applause and cheers fill the vast opera hall once again, as if someone has removed the hands covering her ears.																						
20	20		301									She finds herself standing on the glorious stage, facing the overwhelming applause and praise.																						
21	21		301									Her eyes subconsciously search the audience, but find nothing. She seems to be looking for someone, and even if she does not remember the face of that person, she somehow knows that the person she is looking for is not among them.																						
22	22		301									The auditorium is filled with well-dressed audience, among whom she sees her mentor, best friend, Construct soldiers and Task Force captains. All of them are just standing stiffly, their eyes empty, their vision coming from all directions and piercing straight at her.																						
23	23		301									No one raises a hand, no lips move, but applause and cheering keep coming from nowhere, lashing at her heart and stripping away the shame and remorse deep inside her, making her fearful, but leaving her nowhere to escape.

33	33		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						It turns out that she has been walking in an illusion woven by herself.																						
34	34		301									She has built a fragile barrier around her lone island in the midst of the terrifying waves, isolating herself from all the loneliness and sorrow, as if by just doing so could bring herself a moment of peace.																						
35	35		301									She repeats her past life in a daze, rewriting the endings.																						
36	36		301									She fights alongside her best friend, saves all her comrades who are fighting for the future, continues to write the music that depicts the true glory, fulfills all the unfulfilled promises, and takes the step that was not taken.																						
37	37		301									She wants to have a chance to choose again, make up for regrets, and atone for her guilt.																						
38	38		301									Are these dreams too beautiful to be true, so they need to be embellished with suffering?																						
39	39		301									Her body has shed its last drop of blood, her soul shattered and wounded. Does she now have the power to create art, to write the real music?																						
40	40		301									The questions will never be answered as everything was but her imagination. Once again, she is dragged and pushed to face the cruel reality.																						
41	41		301									She wasn't able to save anyone. Even the Hetero-Core shard was not delivered to Ayla in the end.																						
42	42		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					What... happened after that?

44	44		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		She feels her body is constantly changing.																						
45	45		301									The crimson sea wraps around her, engulfing, disintegrating, tearing, fusing, and reconstructing.																						
46	46		301									Her consciousness seems to be stripped away from her body, and her vessel cries out a blood-curdling wail of pain, regarded as a voice of calamity as it travels the earth while her soul gazes at the stars above.																						
47	47		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The starry sky seen from Earth is far more beautiful than the "stars" she remembers seeing every night before going to sleep. It has surpassed all her imagination.

50	50		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						—Is this what people in the Golden Age saw everyday?																						
51	51		301									How wonderful would it be if she can share this majestic view with others? How much ink and paper does she need to describe her thoughts in full?																						
52	52		301									The iris-like girl seemed to be bothered by the same problem in the distant past.																						
53	53		301									What did she reply back then?																						
54	54		301									—It's all good. If I cannot share it in a letter, I can always leave it till later when we meet in person.																						
55	55		301									—That way, I can always be looking forward to it.																						
56	56		301									—We still have lots of time after all.																						
57	57		301									Her mind wanders in never-ending torment.

66	67		301									—Selena.																						
67	68		301									She hears a call across all the storms and vague, distorted memories. It hits her chest like a celestial light.																						
68	69		301									It contains more emotion than any of her illusions, making her want to weep.																						
69	70		301									After what feels like an eternity, she finally hears a call so real. It is more pleasant than the chirping of a nightingale, and more lasting than a blue whale's song.																						
70	71		301									This is the voice that she has been waiting to hear. This is the voice that has been reconstructed for numerous times in her dreams.																						
71	72		301									The voice has been watching her, soothing her, and guiding her.																						
72	73		301									The person who has always been in her dreams finally can be recognized.																						
73	74		301									She tries hard to take back the ownership of her body.																						
74	75		301									The call is also her guidance. Just by exchanging one look, she already remembers her mission and knows what to do.																						
75	76		301									She takes the item that person hands over, then gathers her last strength in her broken arm to push the human away.																						
76	77		301									She watches the human walk toward the rising sun. That person hesitates for a while, but never looks back, leaving her behind with a cold, solid hope wrapped in her arms.																						
77	78		301									But she is not Eurydice, so she stabs the black probe into her power core.																						
78	79		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					When light falls upon her at the final moment, she gives a satisfying smile.
