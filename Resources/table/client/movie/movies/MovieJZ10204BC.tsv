12	11		301								Roland	How can we wake her up then?																						
13	12		301									Looking at the unconscious Lucia, Luna walked to the surgery pod and slowly raised her right hand to Lucia's face. The red electric currents started running up and down her fingertips.

16	15		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						As Luna touches Lucia ever so lightly, the scarlet Punishing Virus spreads from Luna to the entire operating pod.																						
17	16		301									The virus invaded Lucia from different angles, and after such strong stimulation, Lucia opened her eyes.

32	31		301									Lucia broke free of Luna's power and Gabriel came between them just in time.																						
33	32		301									Lucia took advantage of the situation and sprang out of the gap between the three, then rolled on the ground to pick up the weapon next to the pilot's body.
