7	7		301								Qu	That's fine. I've never wanted to end human suffering that way, anyway.	1																					
8	8		301								Qu	When a plan fails, we just move on to the next one.	1																					
9	9		301								Qu	I have all the time in the world now that I'm behind the scenes.	1																					
10	10		301								Bai Gui	So are you still trying to think of a way to kill all humans in an instant without putting them through pain?	2																					
11	11		301								Qu	I would have said "yes" in the past without a moment's hesitation.	1																					
12	12		301								Qu	But after what happened this time, I can't be so sure anymore.	1																					
13	13		301								Bai Gui	Is it because of that team?	2																					
14	14		301								Qu	Yes. I thought they would choose to save more people and avenge those who died at the hand of their enemy.	1																					
15	15		301								Qu	But they chose a totally different path and missed such a perfect opportunity.	1																					
16	16		301								Qu	They've paid such a heavy price for their choice and lived through such pain, but they still stay on the frontline of the war and never give in.	1																					
17	17		301								Qu	They are so miserable and fragile, yet they still shine in all their beauty.	1																					
18	18		301								Qu	Old ideas probably aren't meant to work anymore.	1																					
19	19		301								Qu	It's probably time that we adjust Tabula Akasha accordingly.	1																					
20	20		301								Bai Gui	(Nods) I think you'll find your answer.	2																					
21	21		301								Bai Gui	No matter what happens, you will always have our support.	2																					
22	22		204							1	1																							
23	23		301								Qu	...Thank you.	1																					
24	24		301								Bai Gui	...	2																					
25	25		204							1																								
26	26		301								Qu	Well... Let's put aside these issues with humans for now.	1																					
27	27		301								Qu	Luna must be eliminated no matter how Tabula Akasha evolves.	1																					
28	28		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	Let's see through our deal first, little Murray from Babylonia.	1
