6	5		301								Liv	I can't identify its properties, but I've been recording all the observational data. I'll hand it over to HQ after this.	1

20	18		301								Camu	But they do not know, what you have been going through.	2																					
21	19		301								Kamui	...Enough with the hogwash, at least my plan's complete.	1																					
22	20		301								Camu	You're still so naive. Indeed, you have fended against the viral corruption with the power of Tenebrion, but can you really take all the credit?	2																					
23	21		301								Kamui	I admit, I needed your help there...	1
