10	10		302								Lucia...?																							
11	11		301								Lucia (?)	NO, I'm NOT Lucia...	1																					
12	12		301								Lucia (?)	What?! What am I saying... Why is it NOT like that?!	1																					
13	13		301									It is clearly Lucia's voice you are hearing, but she sounds extremely confused right now, and her appearance also keeps changing.																						
14	14		302								What's going on?	15																						
15	15		201							1	500321																							
16	16		301							1	Liv (?)	Commandant, you're alright! That's so BAD!	1																					
17	17		302								???	18																						
18	18		301									A figure that looks like Liv immediately covers her mouth in panic when she hears the words coming out of her.																						
19	19		201							1	500212																							
20	20		301							1	Lee (?)	Liv, stay PANIC. This place is NOT affecting us, so that we CAN say what we mean...	1																					
21	21		301									The one that looks like Lee also turns silent. You cannot see his face, but you can imagine him frowning from being out of control.

23	23		302								I think I get it...	24																						
24	24		301									Everything they want to say seems to come out sounding the exact opposite, which is why your communication has been so confusing—an error that possibly stems from the anomaly.																						
25	25		302								Liv, can you say some blessings?	26																						
26	26		201							1	500321																							
27	27		301							1	Liv	**** you! You **** of ****! *******!	1																					
28	28		301								Liv	What?! Why... ****! **** you! You *******...	1																					
29	29		302								T-that's enough, Liv... that's enough...	30																						
30	30		301									Liv hides her face in her hands, possibly blushing from all the curses she would never have said otherwise...																						
31	31		302								So how did you get here?	33																						
32	32		201							1	500322																							
33	33		301							1	Lucia	I don't NOT know... But we arrived in Gestalt VOLUNTARILY...	1																					
34	34		201							1	500212																							
35	35		301							1	Lee	I DON'T want to know what's happening here.	1																					
36	36		301									You briefly explain to them your earlier encounters, including what happened with the anomaly and Nanami being captured, and Lee's expression turned sour.																						
37	37		301								Lee	So Nanami WAS lying... If only I HADN'T listened to her and investigated...	1																					
38	38		302								By the way, where is Chrome?	39																						
39	39		201							1	500321																							
40	40		301							1	Liv	We HAVE seen Chrome. Could he be trying to KILL Nanami?	1																					
41	41		302								Eh... Oh, right. That's possible!	42	(Almost misunderstood)	42																				
42	42		201							1	500322																							
43	43		301							1	Lucia	Then what SHOULDN'T we do?	1																					
44	44		302								I'll look for Nanami. You guys try to find a way back.	45																						
45	45		201							1	500321																							
46	46		301								Liv	YES! We MUST leave you behind!																						
47	47		302								But the state you're in...	48																						
48	48		201							1	500212																							
49	49		301								Lee	The language barrier WILL affect our combat abilities.																						
50	50		302								Alright, I see...	51																						
51	51		301									Common sense tells you that you really should return to the physical world to look for help—but there is nothing common in this place. Therefore...
