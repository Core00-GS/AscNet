7	5		301								Simon	According to that captain... That means the prosecuted engineers and so on were basically all scapegoats.	2																					
8	6		301								Atiel	While the ones in the know, the ones that decided to hide Amberia... They all got off scot-free and kept this a secret until now.	1

12	8		301									While getting ready for the lab expedition, Simon has been meticulously analyzing the available information. Diana is silent, her eyes glazing off into the distance.

14	9		301							1	Rosetta	Commandant, while we have the time, let me perform maintenance on your Polar Soldier.	1																					
15	1005		302								You know how to?	10	You're not checking on Diana?	11																				
16	10	12	301								Rosetta	Just a little. Sometimes the kids will play with them while the fishermen aren't looking.	1																					
17	11	12	301								Rosetta	To the Forest Guards, this place is the beginning and the end. There's no need to worry about Diana. She can handle herself.	1																					
18	12		301									With that, Rosetta deactivates her levitational modules and half-kneels in the snow. She carefully goes through the joints and welded plates laboriously, leaving not even a single scratch unchecked.

22	14		301								Rosetta	What can I say? I'm just trying my best.	1																					
23	15		301								Atiel	It's more than that. You must be real talented. Me, I can't even hold a candle to you.	2																					
24	16		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Rosetta	I'm just trying my best. I always run into trouble, so I gotta make sure I'm prepared for anything.	1

29	18		301									With the preparations complete, you continue on until you reach the front gate of the research lab.																						
30	19		301									You see a dilapidated gate before you. The wall is covered in varying degrees of damage. Looking through some of the busted windows, you see the vacant interior.																						
31	20		301									The building appears to be on the verge of collapse.																						
32	1011		201							1	500206																							
33	21		301							1	Atiel	What's going on here...? Why are there bionics here?	1																					
34	22		301									You expected some stray bionics, but not a situation like the one before your eyes.

36	23		301							1	Bionic Machine	ROAR!	1																					
37	24		301									Bionics are tunneling in and out of the unguarded building, emptying it of research equipment and parts.

48	29		301							1	Rosetta	Diana, there's got to be some roadblock devices nearby!	2																					
49	30		301								Diana	Yeah. We can activate them, and it should stop the bionics in their tracks.	1																					
50	1016		201							1	500201		400																					
51	31		301							1	Simon	But looks like some of them already ran into the research lab.	1																					
52	32		301								Rosetta	Leave 'em to me and Diana. They can't outrun us, Commandant. Think you can handle activating the roadblocks?	2																					
53	1017		302								Do you know where it's located?	33	Think you two can handle it?	34																				
54	33	1018	301								Rosetta	If I remember correctly, they should be deployed around several locations with natural obstacles.	2																					
55	34	1018	301								Rosetta	We can handle these stragglers.	2
