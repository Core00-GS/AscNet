6	6		301									The girl takes a look at her white body, which seems different from what she perceives as "human." It is made of machines, just like the "robots" in the stories she read before.

9	9		301									She feels somehow disappointed, although she does not even know why she is so obsessed with whether she is "human" or not. Perhaps this word just has a familiar ring to it.																						
10	10		301									She looks around and finds nothing but a dark world.																						
11	11		301									A light spot suddenly appears in the distance, like a beacon that is guiding her.																						
12	12		301									She has also read in stories that, when humans are about to die, there may be similar light spots to guide them toward the afterlifeâ€”but isn't she a robot? How strange.

18	18		301								???	Am I... crying?	1
