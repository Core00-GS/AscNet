8	113		301								Familiar Construct	Uh...	1																					
9	114		202							1					1																			
10	115		301									The familiar Construct in front of her is moving sluggishly, his mechanical insides laid bare in plain sight, with vital fluid seeping into the sand. One arm is broken, causing his attacks to look like comedic flails.	1																					
11	116		201							1	500183																							
12	117		301								Vera	Just one... If I could save just this one...	1																					
13	118		202							1					1																			
14	119		301									In a flash, Vera slashes through the horde of Corrupted moving toward her and rushes to the familiar construct, supporting his sagging form.	1																					
15	120		301									Being a support-type Construct after all, Vera can feel her combat computation modules reaching their max capacity.	1

17	122		201							2	500006		400																					
18	123		301								Vera	Hey, Average Joe. You're an Attacker-type, right?	1																					
19	124		301								Familiar Construct	Yeah... No need to rub it in, I'm an Attacker-type, but you fight better than—	2																					
20	125		202							1	2				1																			
21	1456		301									His speech is interrupted by a brief, metallic screech. Vera has yanked off one of her arms and is hurriedly attaching it to the Construct in the place of his broken limb via nano-reinforcement.

23	127		201							2	500006		400																					
24	1789		301							1	Familiar Construct	You...	2																					
25	128		301								Vera	I'm reaching the limits of my battle capabilities. I'm a Support-type by design, after all. You can still fight if you've got your structure intact, right?	1																					
26	129		301								Vera	...If just one person survives... I'll no longer have to hear the nickname "Death".	1																					
27	130		301								Vera	Use my arm to get past the defense and leave! Leave like you had planned to in the beginning!	1																					
28	131		301								Vera	Stop leaving me with pain. It hurts deeper than the pain in my receptors right now...	1																					
29	132		301								Familiar Construct	But well... I guess being able to feel pain is what proves that we're still alive.	2																					
30	1981		301								Familiar Construct	...Watch out!	2

33	138		301									Vera is suddenly doused with a faceful of ice-cold vital fluid. She pauses mending the limb of the Construct.	1																					
34	1888		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStory/FxUiStoryJianXue.prefab																							
35	139		301									Before the Construct is crushed, he has swung his intact arm into the core of the culprit—a towering Corrupted that leapt into sight out of nowhere—effectively crippling it.	1																					
36	140		301								Familiar Construct	Live.																						
37	141		301									The words reach Vera before he crumbles into lifeless parts. Live—honest well-wishes, but also a curse.																						
38	142		201							1	500195																							
39	143		301							1	Vera	Live... What's even the point of living?	1																					
40	999		202							1					1																			
41	144		401							2	1513																							
42	145		301									The Construct is a lost cause. Vera sprints out with her blades.																						
43	146		201							1	500195																							
44	147		301							1	Vera	Damn it... damn it!	1																					
45	148		202							1					1																			
46	150		301									Even as she fights, Vera no longer feels alive. Were she to live through this, only more fear and pain await.	1																					
47	151		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					One after another, the Corrupted land their blows on her. Once, twice... with every new mark on her body, the pain intensifies.	1																					
48	153		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cgqz1702.jpg																								
49	155		301			AniZhuanchangEnd		1000				The exhausted Vera kneels down on the remains of countless Corrupted and Constructs. Overwhelming pain burns through her. For a split-second, the thought of turning off her pain receptors flashes past.	1																					
50	1717		401							1	22																							
51	156		301									"I don't care if it hurts. Please, don't switch off my pain receptors."	1																					
52	157		301								Vera	...?!	1																					
53	158		301									A painful memory streaks into Vera's mind. Struck by a sudden revelation, she stabs her blade into the ground, forcing herself to stand.	1																					
54	159		301									Every action—her whole person—was born because of pain.	1																					
55	160		301									Because of pain, she realized the shape of her life.	1																					
56	161		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Vera	Hah... So that's how it is, huh...	1

60	165		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Corrupted	—!	1																					
61	166		301									With the pain spurring her on, Vera straightens her upper half. She pulls her blade out of the ground and swings it forward aggressively.	1

64	600		202							1					1																			
65	167		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					A new sensation trickles through the weapon—the pain of the Corrupted. The screams of the devoured civilians, too, flood into her being.																						
66	168		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cgqz1702.jpg																								
67	169		301			AniZhuanchangEnd		1000				The living feel pain, but not mere things. Lifeless things are without form, without self, devoid of everything.	1																					
68	170		301								Vera	You're right, Average Joe! At least I'm able to feel!	1																					
69	171		301									Unlike mere things, she can feel pain. Even the pain of others, too.																						
70	172		301								Vera	Ahaha, it hurts... it really fricking hurts... bastards!																						
71	173		301									For a brief moment, Vera allows the swirling pain to stir in her head, enjoying it as if it were some kind of reward.																						
72	174		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Vera	All right! I'll live! I'll live, and feel the pain that you cannot feel! I'll pillage all that you'll never own again!

75	181		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		Meanwhile, a Kurono transportation truck arrives and parks soundlessly at the extraction point.																						
76	182		301									The Kurono personnel are patrolling the battlefield, seeking for what they deem valuable among the remains of Constructs, humans and Corrupted.																						
77	183		301									A short series of mechanical scraping attracts the attention of some of the workers. Amidst the sand and corpses, there is a girl lying silently on the ground with her heavily damaged blade, missing limbs and all.																						
78	184		301									Her red bangs, wet from vital fluid, barely conceal a pair of sparkling eyes. She is grinning a wide, unhinged smile—a ghoulish sight contrasting the dead bodies surrounding her. She is smiling, just like Death herself.																						
79	185		301									And what better a recommendation letter, than the heaps of Corrupted bodies beside her?																						
80	186		301								Vera	Let me... live.																						
81	187		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					With her still intact vocal modules, she whispers.

84	191		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Kurono Officer	Version BPN-13, Support-type Construct. Name... Vera, huh.																						
85	192		301									The very same words are spoken once more, but the circumstances are entirely different.																						
86	193		301									On that day, Vera resigned from the military. Her files are stamped with the Kurono seal.																						
87	194		301									A blessing, but also a curse.																						
88	195		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					—Bring the pain on.
