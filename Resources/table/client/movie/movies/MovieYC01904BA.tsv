3	3		301			DialogEnable	AniZhuanchangBegin					Alpha leaps into the fumes, and those in the distance also notice some movement. Alpha quickly darts into the sewers to avoid any contact with them.

6	5		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	α	Based on my last exploration, one end of this tunnel leads to Cinderelik and the cultivation pod, while the other has a pit that drops to the lower level.	1

8	7		301									She raises her Katana and dashes in the direction of the pit, but comes upon a sturdy lock.																						
9	8		201							1	500100																							
10	9		301							1	α	...How annoying.	1

13	12		301									Alpha slashes with her weapon, and a crack just large enough for one person appears.																						
14	13		201							1	500100																							
15	14		301							1	α	Give me a hand.	1																					
16	15		202							1					1																			
17	16		301									She grabs the fish-shaped Hetero-Creatures floating around her, and leaps into the narrow passage below.																						
18	17		201							1	500100																							
19	18		301							1	α	They're pretty useful after all.	1																					
20	19		202							1					1																			
21	20		301									She lets go and the two fish-shaped Hetero-Creatures slowly make their way into the passage, but get stuck in the crack because they try to get out at the same time, thrashing their tails.																						
22	21		201							1	500100																							
23	22		301							1	α	Now... there are two places I haven't searched yet.	1

25	24		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Alpha walks briskly toward her target.

27	26		201							1	500100																							
28	27		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	α	Is this...	1																					
29	28		202							1					1																			
30	29		301									In front of her is a medium-sized "reservoir." The Red Tide surges within, forming a large vortex. At the center is a mechanical apparatus, pumping the Red Tide through the sewer pipes like a heart.																						
31	30		201							1	500100																							
32	31		301							1	α	...Is this the transport core of the Red Tide?	1																					
33	32		301									As to where it is being transported to, Alpha has a rough idea.																						
34	33		301								α	It's being sent there?	1																					
35	34		202							1					1																			
36	35		301									While exploring the sewers, she found a strange room filled with plants.																						
37	36		301									Poking around the room, Alpha noticed that there was a passage hidden under a red tree.																						
38	37		301									She wanted to head down for a look, but Cinderelik's sudden appearance threw a wrench in her plans.																						
39	38		301									Although she is not sure, she has scoured almost the entirety of the area, with only the hidden room remaining unexplored.																						
40	39		201							1	500100																							
41	40		301							1	α	Looks like that's the most suspicious place.	1																					
42	41		301								α	But I'd better do a thorough search of this place before leaving.	1																					
43	42		202							1					1																			
44	43		301									Alpha frowns, looking for a safe area from which to dive into the Red Tide vortex.																						
45	44		301								??	...Oh!																						
46	45		301									Alpha hears a familiar voice from behind, and turns around, trying to make out the shadowy figure blending into the darkness.																						
47	46		201							1	500100																							
48	47		301							1	α	Roland?	1																					
49	48		301									Alpha cautiously walks toward the darkness to confirm her suspicion.																						
50	49		301								Roland	D-don't come any closer.																						
51	50		301									His voice trembles slightly, and his voice module shows traces of damage.																						
52	51		301								Roland	I look horrible right now. Don't want to startle my audience, you know?																						
53	52		301								α	What are you doing here?	1																					
54	53		301								Roland	What else? I'm here for the same purpose as you.																						
55	54		301								α	You're also looking for Luna?	1																					
56	55		301								Roland	That's right. To tell you the truth, I just came from below.																						
57	56		301								α	...No luck either, eh?	1																					
58	57		301								Roland	I've searched every nook and cranny, but other than some hazardous items, there's nothing else down there .																						
59	58		301								Roland	It seems that Luna is not here, but whether this is good or bad news is hard to say.																						
60	59		301									The two fell silent amidst the sound of running water in the background.																						
61	60		301								α	You are still alive. Does that mean that you've dealt with Gabriel's "backup"?	1																					
62	61		301								Roland	Of course.																						
63	62		301								α	Did you see Luna?	1																					
64	63		301								Roland	Unfortunately... It took everything I had to defeat her.																						
65	64		301								α	...	1																					
66	65		301								Roland	Don't give me that look. Even Luna had trouble dealing with it.																						
67	66		301									Roland laughs awkwardly with his damaged voice module.																						
68	67		301								α	If even Luna found it hard, how could you possibly handle it?	1																					
69	68		301								α	Roland, I used to suspect that you've been hiding your true strength.	1																					
70	69		301								α	Even while I was in the M.I.N.D., I suspected that. Why were you able to hold off the Gray Ravens?	1																					
71	2001		301								Roland	You don't have to be on guard against me. It's only because I've grown. I'm no longer the same as before.																						
72	70		301								Roland	I've been hiding my true strength, but it's Babylonia I'm hiding it from.																						
73	71		301								Roland	If I showed my true power from the very beginning, that would have changed the tactics they used against me, no?																						
74	72		301								Roland	The reason I was able to deal with someone that even Luna had trouble dealing with is easy.																						
75	73		301								Roland	I watched her grow up. I'm familiar with her battle tactics.																						
76	74		301								Roland	Gabriel was proud of the sisters he trained because they were able to replicate the enemy's attack.																						
77	75		301								Roland	But a replica is only an imitation after all, and she wasn't able to differentiate a good move from a bad one.																						
78	76		301								Roland	During the Golden Age, there was a joke about how to prevent kitties from learning to open the door.																						
79	77		301								Roland	The reason I was able to defeat her was easy. It was just as what the joke implied.																						
80	78		301								α	Using meaningless battle tactics to mislead the opponent?	1																					
81	79		301								Roland	No, it's a little more cunning than that. And for that, I have to thank you.																						
82	80		301								α	?	1																					
83	81		301								Roland	I prepared a disguise in advance to mislead her into thinking that the wounds you gave me were self-inflicted during battle to strengthen myself.																						
84	82		301								Roland	She was skeptical at first, but once I cut off my left arm, she finally started to imitate my behavior.																						
85	83		301								α	...	1																					
86	84		301								Roland	Most people have a hard time defeating a learning machine, especially one that can quickly surpass the original... Well, unless she has a terrible teacher like me, that is.																						
87	85		301									Roland's voice is almost drowned out by the churning of the Red Tide. He gives a dry laugh and pauses for a bit, as if his stamina could no longer support the chit-chat and laughter like before.																						
88	86		301								Roland	As for the connection between you and Lucia in the M.I.N.D... or that battle between the Gray Ravens and me...																						
89	87		301								Roland	It wasn't actually a real battle.																						
90	88		301								Roland	After our talk, I temporarily retreated and prepared a little "gift" to delay them and stood on the sidelines, waiting.																						
91	89		301								Roland	I had planned to use it to delay you, but at least it came in handy...																						
92	90		301								α	...Where will you go next?	1																					
93	91		301								Roland	Please allow me to keep that to myself for now.																						
94	92		301								α	Oh? Fine then.	1																					
95	93		202							1																								
96	94		301									She turns around, her back to the shadow standing behind the machine, and starts to walk out.																						
97	95		301								Roland	Hold on.																						
98	96		301									Alpha stops, but does not turn back.																						
99	97		301								Roland	If Luna's disappearance is related to "Lucia" after all...																						
100	98		301								Roland	Will you keep on searching for her?																						
101	99		301								Roland	Luna has always yearned for...																						
102	100		201							1	500100																							
103	101		301							1	α	Roland, I know what you want to say.	1																					
104	102		301								α	Even if Luna wavers in her responsibility to Ascnet and loses sight of what she wants, I'll still know what it is that she wishes for.	1																					
105	103		301								α	I've never brought it up because this wish will never come true.	1																					
106	104		301								α	We are Ascendants, and we can't place our hopes in Babylonia. Nor can we count on "Lucia" and her commandant, who we know nothing about.	1																					
107	105		301								α	Unless the Gray Ravens have changed their position.	1																					
108	106		301								α	I know what happened in the Arctic was the last straw for her...	1																					
109	107		301								α	But to get to that goal, we need time to prepare.	1																					
110	108		301								Roland	...																						
111	109		301									Roland seems to have murmured something from behind the machine, but his words were swallowed up by the whirling vortex.																						
112	110		301								α	This base has been destroyed, and there is still a team from Babylonia on the upper level. They should have encountered the other agent by now.	1																					
113	111		301								α	It is now up to him to settle the score for the accumulated conflicts with the humans. I'll also be able to get out of this mess and continue my search for Luna.	1																					
114	112		301								α	In any case, the heap of problems that was piling up collapsed during this battle.	1																					
115	113		301								α	When the remaining issues have been resolved, I shall take Luna away to fulfill her true desire.	1																					
116	114		301								α	Although you have learned things you shouldn't have, we still have a chance to fix this because of you.	1																					
117	115		301								Roland	Is this your way of saying thank you?																						
118	116		301								α	Take it as you will.	1																					
119	117		301								Roland	How heartless.																						
120	118		301								Roland	I have searched through the sewers. Are you still planning to look for Luna here?																						
121	119		301								α	I have some unfinished business.	1																					
122	120		301								Roland	In that case, good luck.																						
123	121		301								Roland	Hasta luego.																						
124	122		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				α	...	1
