31	31		301								???	C-cough...																						
32	32		301									A few moments later, a barely intact door opens up, and a figure appears amidst the black smoke. A masculine male Construct walks out and coughs, his hand waving, trying to clear the smoke away.

77	77		301								Noctis	And we're retreating for no reason! Our mission directory got cleared, and all of our jobs got assigned to those copycats in Hellhound!	2

137	137		301								Collins	Seriously? Do you know how many favors I've had to trade in order to get the authority to employ that squad and their commandant?	1																					
138	138		204							1	5																							
139	139		301								Collins	The Parliament doesn't want to make a fuss in front of the public—a Chief Commandant getting taken by an unknown force? It's a slap in their face, and it risks exposing us to the public.	1																					
140	140		301								Collins	Frankly, I'm not interested in playing house with those Parliament folks... but now's not the best time for us to stand in the limelight.	1																					
141	141		204							1																								
142	142		301								Collins	Therefore, you and your whole shtick... dearest Miss Popular? Better you do it this time instead of Kurono.	1

144	144		301									The sweet-looking woman before Collins smiles and fixes her hair.																						
145	145		301								???	I understand. My resume is "clean" on the surface, at the very least.	2																					
146	146		301								Collins	Haha, "clean" my ass... A resume's no good apart from tricking those naive babies anyway. Whatever—intentionally revealing a flaw of ours might get them wary instead.	1																					
147	147		301								???	Anyhow, you're asking me to be the face of the operation, is that so?	2																					
148	148		301								Collins	On the surface, sure. But you know your actual job description is going to be so much longer.	1																					
149	149		301								Collins	Ever since what happened, I've been studying what's happening with the commandant. Memory replays from a corrupted Mind Beacon... the data suggests that this condition can't be actively controlled.	1																					
150	998		301								Collins	Which means it could happen again as long as the commandant exists.	1																					
151	150		204							1	5																							
152	151		301								Collins	I'm sure that little brain must be hiding even more secrets. I have a hunch... a strong hunch that the commandant is what I've been looking for.	1

154	153		301								???	You're sure that you can find what you want in that commandant's brain?	2																					
155	154		204							1																								
156	155		301								Collins	Ha, of course not! My hypothesis is baseless! But if we only act with absolute certainty, humans would still be nose-picking monkeys and long extinct. Everything beautiful and true is accidental.	1																					
157	156		301								???	Humans don't evolve from monkeys. It's apes if anything.	2

160	159		204							1																								
161	160		301								Collins	I've got two pieces of the puzzle now—a corrupted Mind Beacon from entering an Ascendant's M.I.N.D. and the memory replays from its chain reactions. What an accident! Will the pieces match? What pattern will they make?	1																					
162	161		301								Rebecca	Collins...	2																					
163	162		204							1	5																							
164	163		301								Collins	Finding a commandant that can resist a M.I.N.D. corruption and catching an Ascendant... we've successfully taken our first step into a new era of R&D.	1																					
165	164		301								Collins	The first and the most important step.	1																					
166	165		301								Rebecca	Collins, sir, please be careful—	2																					
167	166		204							1	7																							
168	167		301								Collins	Huh?	1																					
169	168		301								Rebecca	I'm certain that the things you said involve top Kurono secrets, and I'm sure it was an accident that you revealed them. I'll pretend I haven't heard any of them. Don't worry.	2																					
170	169		204							1																								
171	170		301								Collins	No, you don't have to worry. This place isn't bugged or anything.	1																					
172	171		301								Rebecca	You're a high-ranking Kurono officer, and I'm just the middleman between you and the Parliament who doesn't benefit from it all. I don't want my position altered unknowingly.	2																					
173	172		301									Having gotten disrupted by her strong and unwavering words, Collins does not appear to be displeased. Instead, he laughs.																						
174	173		301								Collins	Whatever! If you'd have betrayed us, you'd have done it by now—likewise, you wouldn't be here if Kurono wanted you gone. If I've decided to tell you the truth, it means that, at the very least, I trust you.	1																					
175	174		301								Rebecca	Why does that sound more like a threat...	2																					
176	175		204							2																								
177	176		301								Rebecca	Fine, leave it to me. I don't run away from a mission for the higher-ups.	2																					
178	177		301								Collins	That's the attitude! I picked you precisely because of that confidence... I look forward to your work. Let's scour every last inch of that commandant's brain for all the secrets hidden inside!	1																					
179	178		204							2	4																							
180	179		301								Rebecca	Sir...	2																					
181	180		301								Collins	Alright. I've made myself pretty clear.	1

202	200		301								Operation Leader	Missions for Cerberus are usually issued by the Chief Commander through direct channels. This... I've honestly no idea what's going on.																						
203	201		301								Chief Advisor	I see... But their recent mission logs have all been cleared, and all their operation statuses are marked "transferred." It can't be...?																						
204	202		301								Operation Leader	Don't ask about things we shouldn't know. Even I only know that they're related to the experimental remote connections... I've never seen their "commandant." If they're getting assigned through us instead...																						
205	203		301								Operation Leader	Anyway, if the operation is assigned through us, then it's our job. Give me the status of Cerberus.

234	232		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Parliament Square, Babylonia.																						
235	233		301									Today is the first day Cerberus is assigned a mission since they have been evacuated from supporting Strike Hawk and remained on standby.																						
236	234		301									As their captain, Vera was called to confirm the mission details two hours ago. Noctis, having been breakdancing in their lounge room and picking on Hellhound, is also off to "upgrade" his gears enthusiastically.																						
237	235		401							2	1515																							
238	236		301								Vera	21, meet us at the war room in ten minutes.																						
239	237		301									Meanwhile, No. 21 is heading to the war room by herself.

243	241		301									The artificial sun on Eden is warm today.																						
244	242		301									Dust swirls and floats in the sunlight. No. 21 has observed a great many things—ants walking in dirt, patterns on leaves, fine furs on animals... but this is the first time she notices dust in the light.																						
245	243		301									She holds up her hand, and the rays of slightly blinding light shine through the gaps between her fingers, tangling. She cannot catch them, but she can feel their heat—this is the first time she has experienced this.																						
246	244		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Sunlight, dust, birds... humans.

249	247		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						A few human figures walk past her from behind. Their gloomy, oppressive presence sticks out like a dark cloud under the sun.																						
250	248		301									Her animalistic sensitivity makes her turn her head.																						
251	249		301									She can smell the humans' scents clearly, and how they are different from the way other humans usually smell. She catches hints of fragrance from their soap, from their food... Scents that reassure and comfort her.																						
252	250		401							1	201																							
253	251		301									But No. 21 also notices the pills, the chains, and the oil used to polish firearms. They remind her of the research institute where she stayed... as well as "that place." They all signify danger, unknown, and darkness.																						
254	252		301									Among the black-clad figures, the human in a long-sleeved windbreaker seems to notice No. 21's inquisitive gaze, looking up to meet it.																						
255	253		301									No. 21's eyes open wide, showing no intention to avoid the human's stare. The sense of danger does not come from the human but the black-clad figures around.																						
256	254		301									With one look, No. 21 recognizes that the tense figures in black have weapons hidden among their briefcases. The sense of familiarity further grabs ahold of her, digging up the word "Kurono" from her repressed memories.																						
257	255		301									She remembers her last mission months ago and how the scent of "Kurono" has been lingering in her M.I.N.D.																						
258	256		301									Does this human know of the danger? Or perhaps the human is their leader?																						
259	257		301									With her almost animalistic instinct, No. 21 quickly makes multiple assessments of the situation, only to have them rebutted by more questions.																						
260	258		301									The human looks away after a quiet glance.																						
261	259		301								No. 21	...																						
262	260		301									That one glance has No. 21 relax her alerted, tensed body.																						
263	261		301									Whatever danger there is, that human has shown no fear. She can tell from those eyes that things are still in control.																						
264	262		301									This is Babylonia, not the research institute or Kurono. There are no unexpected menaces or experiments on her path that would put her on a leash.																						
265	263		401							2	1515																							
266	264		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Vera	...21? You done spacing out?																						
267	265		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory261.png																								
268	267		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						No. 21 retracts her gaze. The sense of security is back.

270	269		301							1	No. 21	Yes, Capt.	1																					
271	270		301									She replies in the comms. Her body is alerted by the uncertainty, but she is no longer afraid nor lost the way she was.																						
272	271		301									Whatever lies ahead, No. 21 does not run away. She confronts them.																						
273	272		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				No. 21	No. 21 is ready. Awaiting orders.	1
