14	14		302								What do you think, Nanami?	15	It doesn't seem that simple to me.																					
15	15	18	301							1	Nanami	No matter who it is, I kinda feel bad for him. I hope we can get him out of there...	1

20	21		301							1	Watanabe	The heart of the fortress should be on the other side of the door.	1																					
21	22		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				Is the CPF really all the way down here?	23																						
22	23		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Watanabe	In a doomsday fortress, you don't need to worry about the virus outside. The CPF would therefore be somewhere inside.	1																					
23	24		301							1	Watanabe	All right, I'm not sure if it's safe on the other side of the door. You all should back up...	1																					
24	25		301							1		Watanabe twists the heavy handle with force. A whoosh of air rushes through the airlock gap.																						
25	26		301							1		As the airlock door slowly opens in front of you, you are greeted by a blinding flash, followed quickly by the sound of explosions.																						
26	27		301							1	Watanabe	Down!	1																					
27	28		301							1		You all drop to the ground, trying to evade whatever weapons that will come flying at you.

32	33		301							1	Watanabe	...Up you get. Looks like it was a bluff.	1																					
33	34		301							1		You all stand up slowly to see spent firecrackers , and... a graffitied wall.
