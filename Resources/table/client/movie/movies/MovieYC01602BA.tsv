3	3		301			DialogEnable						Hola, amigo.																						
4	4		301									If someone tells you to make a wish...																						
5	5		301									What would you ask for?																						
6	6		301									Strength? Money? Power?																						
7	7		301									Perhaps most people would be quiet and think it over first in order to sort through thousands of wishes and then pick the one with the highest priority.																						
8	8		301									Even if this is just a casual question, there is no promise to make their wishes come true. Humans will waste their time putting their wishes in order just in case they were ever to meet a genie.																						
9	9		301									Humans are such greedy creatures that they don't even realize it most of the time.																						
10	10		301									What about me...? I'd think it over quietly, but I'd never come up with an answer.																						
11	11		301									Because I don't have any wishes.																						
12	12		301									Not even to have the strength to survive anymore.																						
13	13		301									I've tried before, but it didn't work out too well. Just look at me now.																						
14	14		301									I wanted a simple life, but the virus destroyed it all. I wanted to be with my family, but they rotted right before me. I wanted to walk a new path, but I ended up deserted, and lost what little I was worth as a "human."																						
15	15		301									I used to make every move for the purpose of "living." I kept struggling to live, and it still went up in smoke.																						
16	16		301									So I've chosen not to struggle or be hopeful. Maybe I will consume all my energy and then rot in Kurono's disposal plant. Doesn't that sound okay, too?																						
17	17		301									Until one day, dazzling white light fills my whole world.																						
18	18		301									The screening process is the same for everyone. This is child's play compared with Kurono's screening process. However, both are excruciatingly painful.																						
19	19		301									—Listen to the screams of those that can still move. You could make music with their screams. If this was the Golden Age, I'm sure a remix of them would top the charts for a least a week.																						
20	20		301									That being said, I'm surprised I can still move.

32	32		301								Roland	Weren't you listening?	1																					
33	33		301									As if he didn't hear the irony in Gabriel's words, Roland narrows his eyes and smiles. He folds his hands behind his head and leans against the wall in a more comfortable position.																						
34	34		301								Gabriel	No, I wasn't.	2																					
35	35		301								Roland	Yeah, sure.	1																					
36	36		301								Gabriel	I thought you already had the perfect "audience."	2																					
37	37		301								Roland	That's different.	1																					
38	38		301								Roland	Sometimes, I wish I could at least get a response out of my "audience."	1

48	47		301							1	Luna	Why are you still alive?	1

58	57		301									Unfortunately, no.																						
59	58		301									What an unbelievable girl. What kind of experience made her look like this?																						
60	59		301									So far, she has gone farther than anyone else.																						
61	60		301									A new road through a strange wilderness is before her, yet she is the only traveler.																						
62	61		301									Her whereabouts and destination... have me at the edge of my seat.																						
63	62		301									Does she really understand what her desire implies?																						
64	63		301									That is the desire to subvert the laws of the world, with which all of human history will be rewritten.

70	69		301								Roland	I always felt like nothing in this world mattered. But at that moment, I realized that I might still want to live.	1																					
71	70		301								Roland	So I should at least offer you my gratitude.	1

79	78		301									After a few faint sighs, Luna raises her hand, causing the wall behind her to collapse at the touch of her fingertips.																						
80	79		301									A figure emerges from the rubble, shakes his hair, and stares at Luna with a cold gaze.																						
81	80		301								Luna	I've already accepted your thanks. Why are you still following me?	1

100	99		201							1	500252																							
101	100		301							1	Roland	Because you came out of this hellhole just like me, and you look like you're going to do something interesting.	1																					
102	101		202							1					1																			
103	102		301									I want to see, too.

112	111		301									This is one of their short respites during their journey long ago. However, Ascendants need not rest due to their power from the Punishing Virus—let alone build a campfire.																						
113	112		301									The agent of the Ascension-Network does not know why she still maintains some of her habits she once had as a human.

117	116		301								Roland	And what makes you say that?	2																					
118	117		301								Luna	I created you. I am your "Creator".	1																					
119	118		301								Roland	But you obviously didn't care before.	2																					
120	119		301								Luna	I changed my mind. It's not like you've found your "purpose," right?	1																					
121	120		301								Roland	...Very well.	2																					
122	121		301								Roland	But... If I find my purpose, then I will leave. I may even become your enemy. What do you have to say about that?	2																					
123	122		301								Luna	Do what you will. I will continue with my plan. If I have to squash one more pest, than so be it.	1																					
124	123		301								Roland	...	2

154	152		301								α	Besides, there's no what-ifs in this world.	2

181	178		301								Roland	If this was the Golden Age, I think I could write a book about all my struggles. Hmmm... What would I call it? Let me see... How about "Roland's Success: The Power of Language"?	1

237	232		301									The teamwork they exhibited was far more troublesome than the entire Construct Army.																						
238	233		301									Even though the old frame had been reinforced, it cannot sustain the long drawn-out intensity of the battle. Looks like the battle has to come to a close.																						
239	234		301									More importantly, that Gray Raven Commandant—																						
240	235		301									—A commandant from the new generation of "elite commandants" that are loved by their team members and valued by Babylonia.																						
241	236		301									As for the Ascendant, he might just have the key in his hand.																						
242	237		301									But if you don't have enough strength, then the meaningless quality of "tenderness" can only be called "cowardice."

249	243		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Roland	Oh, humans... You just love to run your mouth about sunshine and rainbows to have us sacrifice ourselves. What's the big deal, right? When you can just wipe our memories, and here we go again, wagging our tails.	1																					
250	244		301								Roland	All your pretty words, simply because these Constructs are still useful to you.	1																					
251	245		301								Roland	To us Ascendants, everything's fair and honest. We only serve absolute power, and when we unite, we'll create a world where humans are the ones who go extinct.	1																					
252	246		301								Lucia	Enough with that!	2																					
253	247		301								Roland	Fine, fine. I know you won't listen.	1																					
254	248		301								Roland	But if your commandant asks you to kill your sister now, will you be able to do it?	1																					
255	249		301								Roland	Can you really put that blade of yours in Luna's heart?	1																					
256	250		301								Lucia	I...	2

258	252		301									Lucia visibly trembles for a moment, but then grabs the hilt of her katana and answers resolutely—

261	255		301							1	Lucia	I trust that the commandant won't make me choose.	2																					
262	256		301								Lucia	Even then, the commandant will respect whatever choice I make.	2																					
263	257		202							1	2				1																			
264	258		301									No. I want to know what you will choose.

267	261		301							1	Roland	Is that so?	1																					
268	262		301								Roland	Let me rephrase it.	1																					
269	263		301								Roland	Facing your closest family, who stands opposite you, her hands soaking in blood, do you—	1																					
270	264		202							1	2				1																			
271	265		301									If she wants to return with you, will you welcome her with open arms as before?																						
272	266		301									Unfortunately, Gabriel interrupts the conversation.																						
273	267		301									However, Lucia's gaze already portrayed her conviction.																						
274	268		301									Running on the road to the core area, Roland lets out a muffled laugh.

284	278		301							1	Roland	Purpose?	1																					
285	279		301									Alpha, the Gray Ravens, and Babylonia will be destroyed. Only then will Luna be able to unleash the true power of the Ascension-Network.																						
286	280		301									But if Luna still craves the warmth of her family and wants to return to a time before all of this—to return to being an ordinary Construct and to her sister's side—then the Gray Ravens will be the key.																						
287	281		301									For this reason, he had already prepared his "bargaining chip."																						
288	282		301								Roland	My purpose... has been pretty obvious since the beginning.	1																					
289	283		202							1					1																			
290	284		301									As for when Luna's purpose became his own? That does not seem relevant anymore.																						
291	285		301									As if in response to the questions rising from the bottom of his heart, Roland clasps his hand at his chest.																						
292	286		201							1	500008																							
293	287		301							1	Roland	...I will pursue her until her dream becomes a reality.	1
