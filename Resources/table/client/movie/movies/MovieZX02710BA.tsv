17	17		301							1	???	I heard that we couldn't even fish out the remains of that team of "Gear"... Not even the Corrupted could escape from that flood of the Punishing Virus.	2																					
18	18		301									Standing next to Haicma is a beast mechanoid with the head of a hound and a humanoid body. He joined the Church of Machina not too long ago.																						
19	19		301									Despite being a new member, Spooner seems to prefer hanging with Haicma, the lone wolf. According to him, "you're not as mad as the rest of them. I've had my share of madmen."																						
20	20		301									He bends down, reaching out and touching a crimson crystal shooting up from underground.																						
21	21		301								???	It looks like... a plant.	2																					
22	22		301								Haicma	How's "Lover" doing, Spooner?	1																					
23	23		204							2	10																							
24	24		301								Spooner	How would I know? Madam Arcana is fixing her right now.	2																					
25	25		301								Haicma	Didn't you check up on her before you left?	1																					
26	26		204							2																								
27	27		301								Spooner	Hmph, I guess the infection wasn't as serious. Madam Arcana hooked up her memory shell with a music player. You can't imagine how funny it was with Zero screaming inside a CD player.	2																					
28	28		301								Spooner	I've saved that video inside the central memory bank. I hope she'd reconsider the next time she's going to spill out nonsense.	2																					
29	29		301								Haicma	I don't think that'll threaten her.	1																					
30	30		301								Haicma	Data analysis of this area is complete. The composition is still unknown, but it contains a high concentration of the Punishing Virus.	1																					
31	31		301									Haicma lifts a finger. Her fingertip projects a waterfall of data as she transfers it to Spooner.																						
32	32		201							2	500491		-400																					
33	33		301								Spooner	This level of concentration... It's going to instantly devour anyone trapped inside, no screw spared. It's not difficult to imagine how hard Zero's "Gear" got hit...	2																					
34	34		301									Haicma frowns slightly. Her system is retrieving the wireless signals that were sent and received nearby.																						
35	35		301								Haicma	What this flood can do to humans and Constructs is catastrophic.	1																					
36	36		301								Haicma	We should also stay away from it.	1																					
37	37		301									Haicma watches the scarlet stream flowing past the plateau they are standing on.																						
38	38		301								Haicma	..."Red Tide".	1																					
39	39		301								Spooner	Huh?	2																					
40	40		301								Haicma	A fitting name.	1																					
41	41		201							2	500490	4	-400																					
42	42		301									Haicma turns around and looks Spooner in the eye.																						
43	43		301								Haicma	Humans have named it Red Tide.	1																					
44	44		301								Haicma	Objective updated. We are to investigate the "Red Tide" appearing around the Church of Machina, recording and analyzing its data, and determining its cause and threat level.	1																					
45	45		301								Haicma	You take west; I'll take east. Let's get going.	1																					
46	46		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Spooner	Alright. Be careful.	2
