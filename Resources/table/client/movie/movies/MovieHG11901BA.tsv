9	9		301									On a random day, you receive a letter from a stranger in your personal mailbox.																						
10	10		301									Most people in this day and age wouldn't send handwritten letters unless it was a confidential document. For one, it's a waste of resources, and for another, it's not instantaneous.																						
11	11		301									But this letter clearly isn't of the confidential sort.																						
12	12		301									The royal blue ink, the soft, smooth sheet, the elegant cursive letters, and the faint woody scent of powder...																						
13	13		301									is all too exquisite and meticulous, almost as if it were a message from another world.																						
14	14		301									Letters have almost been completely replaced by comms in this era. A formal letter like this is exceedingly rare, and only glimpsed in movies filmed in the previous century.																						
15	15		301									Who would use such an antiquated way of communication?																						
16	16		301									Feeling confused, you slowly flip over to the next page.

20	20		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				I'm glad you're reading this line. This means this letter hasn't ended up crushed in the trash can.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
21	21		304							Please don't get me wrong. This is not a prank.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
22	22		304							Truth be told, I'm looking for a "pen pal".	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
23	23		304							I'm not sure if you know what a "pen pal" is.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
24	24		304							I only learned of it recently when I saw it in a book from the Center of Basic Public Education's library.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
25	25		304							Basically, pen pals build a friendship by writing letters to each other.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
26	26		304							People say that, a long time ago, before the information age arrived, people would write letters to communicate across vast distances.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
27	27		304							Perhaps you might think that such an inefficient and costly way of communicating is tedious and a waste of time.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
28	28		304				AniZhuanchangBegin			But when I saw this method, it just seemed so...	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1			1																
29	29		301			AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin					The next word was crossed out several times, and it was obvious that the writer was weighing their words over and over.																						
30	30		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				Romantic.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
31	31		304							Romantic. Yes, that's right, it's the type of romance that we lack in this era.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
32	32		304							An era in which everyone is always in a hurry, in pursuit of maximum levels of efficiency.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
33	33		304							The act of finding stillness and putting your thoughts on paper is simply inconceivable.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
34	34		304							There are even times when I feel that the written word is better than spoken language when it comes to expressing what's deep in your heart.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
35	35		304							No matter where I am, things like good etiquette and upbringing... weigh heavily on my shoulders, smothering me.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
36	36		304							It's only when I'm writing that I can cast off those shackles and be myself.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
37	37		304							The words I can never speak, the feelings inside I can't say out loud... the written word will say what my voice can't.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
38	38		304							What's more, I won't have to deal with the immediate reaction from others, nor will I feel ashamed of the unseemliness of my actions.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
39	39		304							I can write whatever I want on paper and the words that appear on the page reflect who I am inside.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
40	40		304							I seem to be blabbering. Forgive me for being so immature as to get overexcited and let my emotions get the better of me over such a small matter.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
41	41		304							Anyway, since you've read up to this point, you should already have guessed.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1		1																	
42	42		304							I would like you, a stranger, to be my pen pal.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
43	43		304							At first, I was thinking of trying out this method of communication with my friends, 	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
44	44		304							but I came to realize that it was too deliberate, making it more awkward than it should be.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
45	45		304							So I started contemplating sending this letter to a random address in Eden, to a stranger I've never met.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
46	46		304							I don't need to know who you are. Neither do you need to know who I am.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
47	47		304							All we have to do is use this antiquated but simple method of communication to slowly get to know each other.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
48	48		304							Let me briefly introduce myself. I'm Iris and as you've probably guessed, this is not my real name, but rather, a pen name.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
49	49		304							Well, that's enough about me. After all, you might not want to know everything about a stranger's life all at once.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
50	50		304							Perhaps we can talk about our hobbies in our next letter and share what we're passionate about.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
51	51		304							I've attached a return envelope and a blank sheet of paper with this letter. I hope to hear from you.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
52	52		304							If you're too busy with work, don't worry about it. This shouldn't be an onerous process.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
53	53		304							All you have to do is to write your thoughts on the subject down. I'll be really happy with just that.	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
54	54		304							Yours faithfully,	0000ffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1

67	67		301									She suddenly throws herself onto her bed, burying her face in the pillow.																						
68	68		301									After quite some time, she finally looks up in the dim light and peeks at the letter in her hands.																						
69	69		301									As if it were a real person and not just an object.																						
70	70		301									She didn't actually have high hopes of receiving a reply when she sent the letter.																						
71	71		301									That's why she's completely overjoyed right now, to the point of blushing.

75	75		301									Taking a deep breath, Selena gently opens the letter, and couldn't help averting her gaze for a moment.																						
76	76		301									After calming herself down, she covers her eyes and peeks through the gaps between her fingers at the letter paper spread out on the bed.																						
77	77		201							1	500108																							
78	78		301							1	Selena	"Iris..."	1
