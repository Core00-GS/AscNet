18	19		301							1	Roland	Yeah, yeah. We have him. Guy knows how to squirm and hide.	1																					
19	20		301								Roland	An NA-branch underground bunker of the World Government—that's where the guy's holed up.	1																					
20	21		301								Roland	The rathole was built with ballistic missiles in mind. So, naturally, the Corrupted would have a hard time scouring for him.	1																					
21	22		301								Roland	So what's the plan? We waltz right in and blow the place to pieces?	1

31	32		301								Gabriel	After all, this means war.	1																					
32	33		301								Roland	A war with "her"?	2																					
33	34		301								Gabriel	A war with all agents.	1																					
34	35		301								Roland	...Do we have to?	2																					
35	36		301								Gabriel	Though all agents might have different personal interests, we are all chosen by the network to act as its proxy.	1																					
36	37		301								Gabriel	In other words, we serve to realize the network's will.	1																					
37	38		301								Gabriel	And for this, we need a common belief, a common flag... One that unites all of us.	1																					
38	39		301								Gabriel	A flag without binding power is like a castle in the sky... Utterly worthless.	1																					
39	40		301								Roland	...	2																					
40	41		301								Gabriel	Which is why I told you to not meet Miss Luna with such impudence.	1																					
41	42		301								Roland	Hmmmph. I see where you're coming from now.	2																					
42	43		301								Roland	But Miss Luna... What does she really want?	2																					
43	44		301								Gabriel	She has never changed. She wishes to filter out the new humans for the new world.	1																					
44	45		301								Roland	And what after that?	2																					
45	46		301								Gabriel	There is no need to discuss what comes after that.	1																					
46	47		301								Roland	Gabriel, say—	2																					
47	48		301								Gabriel	?	1																					
48	49		301								Roland	What even is... the Ascension-Network anyway?	2																					
49	50		301								Roland	We only know that, Miss Luna can grant us the power to... "filter" through those that wish to join the network.	2																					
50	51		301								Roland	If they maintain their ego in this filtering... they become an Ascendant.	2																					
51	52		301								Roland	And if they don't, they end up like the brainless drones over there.	2																					
52	53		301									Roland gestures at the Corrupted afar, mechanically exacting orders.																						
53	54		301								Roland	But why "Miss Luna"?	2																					
54	55		301								Gabriel	...	1																					
55	56		301								Roland	Why "us?"	2																					
56	57		301								Gabriel	...	1																					
57	58		301								Roland	You must have thought of it before.	2																					
58	59		301								Gabriel	...Thought about what?	1
