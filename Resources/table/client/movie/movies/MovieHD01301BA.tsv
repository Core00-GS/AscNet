3	3		301			DialogEnable						When the cabin door of the transport craft opens, what comes into view does not seem to conform to your impression of a conservation area.																						
4	4		301									Looking down from the landing pad at the valley below, you see hundreds of stalls glimmering in the sun, densely packed in the plaza near the Central Purification Filter.																						
5	5		301									The stalls with colorful roofs depict the bustling scene of a festival market, crowded with people and goods.																						
6	6		301									You knew it would not be deserted, but the level of festivity is far beyond your imagination.

11	11		301								Liv	Relax, Lee. It's okay to take a break on occasion.	3																					
12	12		301								Lucia	Liv's right.	2																					
13	13		301								Lucia	You got to place more importance on resting, Lee.	2																					
14	14		204							1	8																							
15	15		301								Lee	...	1																					
16	16		301									Lee remains quiet, but the expression on his face remains unconvinced.																						
17	17		302								Consider this as recharging our batteries for our next mission.	18																						
18	18		302								Besides, when was the last time everyone had a chance to switch into their civilian coatings? Let's enjoy it.	19																						
19	19		302								Especially you, Lee.	20																						
20	20		301									The Gray Ravens have dusted off their civilian attire and changed out of their combat gear, including Lee.																						
21	21		301									His black suit is crisp and elegant with a lavish tie. It does not appear to be a style Lee would choose voluntarily.

24	24		301							1	Lee	Whose bright idea was this...	1																					
25	25		301									Gray Raven had received prior notice that the conservation area would be hosting a grand celebration.																						
26	26		301									Everyone in the conservation area has been invited to join in the festivities. At the end of the celebration, someone will be selected as the "Celebration Star" and receive a surprise gift.																						
27	27		301									Since you happen to have the day off, you suggested taking Gray Raven to the celebration.																						
28	28		301									Naturally, Liv and Lucia were more than willing. As for Lee, he had no choice but to agree reluctantly to your persistence.																						
29	29		302								I've never seen you wear that.	30																						
30	30		302								Did you just get it made?	31																						
31	31		204							1																								
32	32		301								Lee	Quite the opposite. I've had it for a long time.	1																					
33	33		301								Lee	I originally had this coating made for a banquet prior to joining Gray Raven, but the venue was attacked, so I've never had an opportunity to use it.	1																					
34	34		301								Lee	I don't have anything suitable to wear for the holiday, so I dusted this off and made some minor modifications.	1																					
35	35		201							1	500151																							
36	36		301							1	Lucia	Holiday?	1																					
37	37		302								Today is "White Day".	38																						
38	38		202							1					1																			
39	39		301									Long ago, there was only Valentine's Day in February for people to give each other gifts like roses and chocolates to express their love. That is until the businesses in the Golden Age took the chance to create similar holidays to increase their profit margins.																						
40	40		301									What followed became known as "White Day" in March, "Black Day" in April, and "Rose Day" in May... Then there were holidays in June and July until every month had a special day for lovers to prepare each other gifts.																						
41	41		301									Recently, the brief period of peace and stability has brought a degree of abundance for residents to share with each other.																						
42	42		301									Which "Valentine's Day" it is exactly is irrelevant. People see this festival as a symbol, hoping that they will go from merely surviving to living.																						
43	43		301									As such, careful plans were made in preparation for White Day.

45	45		301							1	Liv	If I remember correctly, that's our first stop.	1

49	49		301									It is an exhibition hall that has been built specifically for the celebration.																						
50	50		301									People could apply for a booth in the exhibition hall in advance, which would serve as an important part of selecting the final "Celebration Star".																						
51	51		301									Having known this in advance, you had already applied for a stall.

61	61		301								Lee	This isn't my area of expertise. Don't have any lofty expectations of me.	1

63	63		302								There's a first time for everything.	64

66	66		301								Liv	You're right. No matter what, I think today will be a special memory.	3
