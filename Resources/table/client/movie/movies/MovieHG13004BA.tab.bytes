4	4		201							1	500506	16																						
5	5		301							1		Noan has just seen off a few customers who were in for a short break. He is standing at the counter and washing their used cups.																						
6	6		301									The water spray makes a drizzling sound in the cup. He stops washing as his mind wanders away.																						
7	7		301									He has been staying in Babylonia for quite some time. Simon often said he was doing his part by helping the Science Council, but Noan is still concerned about the situation on the surface.																						
8	8		301								Noan	...	1																					
9	9		301									Realizing such thoughts cannot make the situation any better, he turns the tap off, takes out a coffee spoon, and puts it in the cup. The metal spoon knocks on the glass, making a crisp sound that echoes in the small sink.																						
10	10		301								Noan	This sounds familiar...	1																					
11	11		301									When Noan was still a human, he used to hear melodies made up from such sounds when he was taking shelter under the eaves from the rain.																						
12	12		301									Wandering Scavengers did not have the privilege of carrying musical instruments with them, but their cups and bowls could compose the simplest form of music.																						
13	13		301									This sound seems to carry their unique warmth. His mind wanders far away.																						
14	14		301								Noan	...I wonder how the battle is going on the surface. Wish I can be there just like any other squad.	1																					
15	15		301									He keeps knocking the spoon on the cup in the sink, as if he is trying to make the good memories last longer.																						
16	16		301									Just then, he hears footsteps coming from behind.																						
17	17		204							1																								
18	18		301								Noan	What can I do for you?	1																					
19	19		301									He turns back and sees a familiar figure.																						
20	20		204							1	1																							
21	21		301								Noan	Good afternoon, Commandant.	1																					
22	22		302								Good afternoon.	23																						
23	23		301								Noan	Do you need any books? Or would you like a drink instead?	1																					
24	24		302								No, I just heard some glass music and was curious.	25																						
25	25		302								I didn't expect it to be you.	26																						
26	26		204							1																								
27	27		301								Noan	...I suddenly recalled a song I learned in the past when I was washing the cups.	1																					
28	28		302								A song from the past?	29																						
29	29		301								Noan	Nothing remarkable, just some boring memories. Do you really want to hear them?	1																					
30	30		302								As long as you are willing to tell.	31																						
31	31		204							1	1																							
32	32		301								Noan	Alright.	1																					
33	33		301									Noan smiles. He puts the cups in order and picks two stirrer sticks of the right size.																						
34	34		301								Noan	...My mother taught me this lullaby when I was a child.	1																					
35	35		204							1	2																							
36	36		301									He softly hums a gentle song, playing a simple yet lingering melody between the glasses.																						
37	37		301									The melody feels like scattered raindrops, resembling the tranquility that can only be found under the eaves on a rainy night.																						
38	38		204							1	1																							
39	39		301								Noan	But I only learned how to play it with glasses a lot later.	1																					
40	40		301								Noan	There was a child in our team. Each time it rained, he would struggle to fall asleep.	1																					
41	41		301								Noan	This is how his dad used to put him to sleep. I was always on night watch, so I often chatted with him. Over time, I also learned how to play music with glasses.	1																					
42	42		301								Noan	I had to put his child to sleep after that. He said it was the "fee" for teaching me.	1																					
43	43		301									Noan quickly cleans the cups and puts them in the sterilizer. He wipes his hands dry and walks over.																						
44	44		301								Noan	Quite a boring story, isn't it?	1																					
45	45		302								It sounds very interesting.	46	Sounds like an ordinary, everyday story.	47																				
46	46	48	301								Noan	Do you find it interesting?	1																					
47	47		301								Noan	Yeah. People who stayed on the surface were used to finding moments of happiness in a tough life.	1																					
48	48		301								Noan	Do you have any other plans? Would you like to have some rest in the library?	1																					
49	49		302								I have other plans.	50																						
50	50		301								Noan	Alright, I'll leave you to it then.	1																					
51	51		302								But there is still some time left.	52																						
52	52		302								I can stay here for now.	53																						
53	53		204							1	11																							
54	54		301									Noan makes a dry smile as he looks at the human commandant's still exhausted face.																						
55	55		204							1																								
56	56		302								Would you like to chat then?	57																						
57	57		302								I haven't really talked to you since you came to Babylonia.	58																						
58	58		301								Noan	Sure. I'm listening.	1																					
59	59		301									Noan turns back and looks into the human's eyes.																						
60	60		302								Hmm...	61																						
61	61		302								Does a Construct need to wear glasses?	62	Did you lose your old goggles?	64																				
62	62		301								Noan	If you are asking about my vision, I no longer needed the glasses when I became a Construct.	1																					
63	63	66	301								Noan	But I have been wearing glasses or goggles all my life. Taking them off would remind me of... the days when I could not even see the road. I'm just not used to not wearing them.	1																					
64	64		301								Noan	Yeah. I probably lost them when I was injured, or during the Construct operation.	1																					
65	65		301								Noan	When I woke up, I only had this pair of glasses from a few years ago. I'm just not used to not wearing them.	1																					
66	66		301								Noan	Asimov also thought a familiar appearance would help me to stabilize the M.I.N.D., so he let me keep wearing them.	1																					
67	67		302								...I see.	68																						
68	68		302								What have you been doing lately?	69																						
69	69		301								Noan	Same as before. Sometimes I go to experiments or checkups, sometimes to the training room.	1																					
70	70		301									He bends down to take out a new, clean glass cup from under the counter, and starts to mix a new drink.																						
71	71		301								Noan	Sometimes, I come here.	1																					
72	72		302								Have you ever tried the drink you made?	73																						
73	73		301								Noan	No, but I made the service robot here to help me check the quality when I was practicing. Constructs don't need to eat or drink, so I don't want to waste it.	1																					
74	74		302								What about the cookie I gave you?	75																						
75	75		204							1	2																							
76	76		301								Noan	I ate it. It tasted great, thanks.	1																					
77	77		204							1	1																							
78	78		302								Are you going to keep staying in the library?	79																						
79	79		301								Noan	Yeah, I'll probably be here until Dark Aries is ready for missions.	1																					
80	80		302								Do you want to be on a mission?	81																						
81	81		204							1																								
82	82		301								Noan	Of course.	1																					
83	83		301								Noan	The situation on the surface was already dire before I came to Babylonia. There are still people outside... and the Forsakens. I wonder how they are doing...	1																					
84	84		204							1	15																							
85	85		301								Noan	I really want to help, but I'm worried that I may bring over the trouble of Ascendants.	1																					
86	86		204							1	16																							
87	87		301								Noan	...	1																					
88	88		301									‚ÄîWhen was the last time he had such a relaxed chat without any purpose?																						
89	89		204							1	2																							
90	90		301									Thinking of those days when everybody trusted and helped one another, Noan smiles and sighs.																						
91	91		204							1																								
92	92		301								Noan	How about you? Have you been having enough rest recently?	1																					
93	93		301									He already knows the answer, but still asks anyway.																						
94	94		301									It is not an intentional attempt to start a conversation, but rather an inquiry asking whether the other party is willing to talk about themselves.																						
95	95		302								All good.	96	Sometimes I find it difficult to fall asleep.	101																				
96	96		301								Noan	I see.																						
97	97		301									He stops asking.																						
98	98		301									Just like Simon said, worrying too much only means he does not have faith in the commandant. Besides, he does not know anything about this human.																						
99	99		301									Whether the commandant really feels alright or does not want to tell him, he has no right to ask.																						
100	100		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Neither of them talks anymore. They just remain silent in the tranquil library.																						
101	101		301								Noan	Have you seen a doctor?	1																					
102	102		302								I still have missions.	103																						
103	103		301								Noan	Even a superman needs a break. Don't take everything on your shoulders.	1																					
104	104		302								But...	105																						
105	105		301								Noan	Too much worry?	1																					
106	106		302								Yeah.	107																						
107	107		301								Noan	A lot of things happened lately. I can understand.	1																					
108	108		301								Noan	I know you are in grief. But you shouldn't hurt yourself to make up for the time lost.	1																					
109	109		301								Noan	Gray Raven, Commandant Simon... They all care about you and are worried about you.	1																					
110	110		301								Noan	If you can trust them and share your burden with them, I'm sure they will be delighted.	1																					
111	111		301								Noan	At least Commandant Simon will feel that way.	1																					
112	112		302								Do you feel the same too?	113																						
113	113		204							1	9																							
114	114		301								Noan	...	1																					
115	115		301									Noan looks a little surprised.																						
116	116		301								Noan	Does that matter to you?	1																					
117	117		302								(Nod)	118																						
118	118		204							1	1																							
119	119		301									He lowers his head and chuckles.																						
120	120		204							1	2																							
121	121		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Noan	Yes. I'll be really glad if you are willing to trust me and share something with me.	1
