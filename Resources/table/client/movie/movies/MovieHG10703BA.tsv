4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Karenina	Commandant, expanding the base is priority number one. We should deploy defenses outside as well.	1																					
5	5		302								Agreed.	6	How much time is left?	7																				
6	6	9	301								Karenina	Hmph, who knows? Hindsight's always 20/20.	1																					
7	7		301								Karenina	Time's of the essence. We're about to be dispatched on our next mission.	1																					
8	8		301								Karenina	We need to repair the base before then, or we'll be in a world of hurt.	1																					
9	9		301								Karenina	I've been wanting to do inventory and confirm the layout of the interior. Commandant, you supervise the construction of the periphery.	1																					
10	10		302								You mean those turrets?	11	I'll try my best.	12																				
11	11	13	301								Karenina	Oh, so you heard. That makes this easier. After all, I can't really just rely on Kamui and Nanami to get the job done...	1																					
12	12		301								Karenina	Just keep an eye out since this isn't your area of expertise. I can't really just rely on Kamui and Nanami to get the job done...	1																					
13	13		301								Karenina	I'll send you the procedure and the completed rendering, Commandant. Just be sure that they don't make a mess of things.	1																					
14	14		302								Looks like we're still short-staffed...	15	I'll be counting on you later!	16																				
15	15	17	301								Karenina	One more member should help... But this is a job for a professional...	1																					
16	16		301								Karenina	If only I had the time! You can't just rely on me to do it all!	1																					
17	17		301								Karenina	Wait... Are you inviting me to stay with the Gray Ravens?	1																					
18	18		302								You bet.	19	In your dreams.	20																				
19	19	21	301								Karenina	Why?! I'm just a member of the Engineering Force.	1																					
20	20		301								Karenina	I knew it! I don't work for free!	1																					
21	21		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Karenina	But if I have some free time, that's a different story...	1
