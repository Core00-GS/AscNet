44	36		301								Chaofeng	Because you're Babylonian Constructs? Made with better tech...?	1

66	58		301								Lucia	It's all over now. This ship can finally return to its rightful home.																						
67	59		301								Chrome	...Yes. The real home of the KCC, the real Kowloong, should be somewhere close to where this ship will finally dock.																						
68	60		301								Lee	The "real" Kowloong?																						
69	61		301								Chrome	The ship we see here is simply a mirage dreamed up by fools, traveling down the same nonexistent route day and night, like an ouroboros chasing after its tail.
