3	3		301			DialogEnable						The airtight valve is tightened under the joint force of the four people. The Scavengers sit in the compartment at the periphery of the tower, gasping for air.																						
4	4		301									The swarm of Hetero-Creatures is barricaded on the other side of the door. They appear to be safe for now.

6	6		401							2	1506																							
7	7		301									But this doesn't mean that the Hetero-Plants will stop their assault any time soon. They hear a loud crashing against the door like a drum from Hell. Small vines whittle their way through a crack in the door, continuously deforming as if trying to use their own volume to pry open the door.

9	9		301							1	Zack	...Damn it. Are these things sentient?	1																					
10	10		201							1	500140																							
11	11		301							1	"Beardy"	What the hell is going on in this tower?	1

13	13		201							2	500139		-400																					
14	14		301							1	Kordes	Those damn plants... They're using the Punishing Virus to erode the tower.	2																					
15	15		301								Kordes	Looks like those plants we saw along the way weren't really plants after all... They were mutated by the Punishing Virus just like those things in the Red Tide...	2																					
16	16		301								Kordes	I should've realized this earlier... Cough...	2																					
17	17		401							2	1503																							
18	18		301									A violent shaking comes from outside. The Hetero-Plants begin a new wave of attacks. The dilapidated railings let out a sad cry under the weight of the assault.																						
19	19		301								"Beardy"	Watch your footing—!	1																					
20	20		301			RImgBg1Shake						"Beardy" quickly pulls Kordes, who was about to fall due to a loose steel plate under his feet and drags him to the platform with a more stable ledge.																						
21	21		301								Kordes	Th-thanks!	2																					
22	22		202							1	2				1																			
23	23		301									Kordes sits on the ground and gasps for air. Standing next to him, Rolmo notices that something had fallen beside "Beardy's" foot, so he picks it up and hands it to him.																						
24	24		201							1	500384																							
25	25		301							1	Rolmo	You guys dropped this.	1																					
26	26		301									"Beardy" takes the bag from Rolmo, opens it, looks at its contents, then tosses it back to Kordes.																						
27	27		201							1	500140																							
28	28		301							1	"Beardy"	Hey. You dropped your raisins.	1																					
29	29		201							1	500139																							
30	30		301							1	Kordes	I've told you a million times. These aren't raisins. They're hydrangea seeds.	1																					
31	31		301									Having sealed the bag, Kordes retorts feebly as if he is fed up with having this conversation over and over again.																						
32	32		201							1	500384																							
33	33		301							1	Rolmo	Hydrangea?	1																					
34	34		203							1	0.25	400																						
35	35		201							2	500139		-400																					
36	36		301							1	Kordes	...It's a new variant we developed. The stem has high rigidity. It won't droop under the weight of too many flowers, unlike the common blue hydrangea, and it's more resistant to pests.	2																					
37	37		301								Rolmo	...Why are you carrying that?	1																					
38	38		301								Kordes	I promised my daughter that I would grow her the most beautiful blue hydrangea—layer after layer of different shades of blue. I was planning on filling the garden of our future home with them.	2																					
39	39		301									He looks at the seeds with a soft look in his eyes, as if recalling a fond memory. However, his expression fades a moment later, replaced by deep sadness.																						
40	40		301								Kordes	This is my research... Or rather, the last fruits of my research.	2																					
41	41		201							2	500140		-400																					
42	42		301							1	"Beardy"	Hmph... We can't even find a safe place to live, and here you are talking about planting flowers for your daughter.	2																					
43	43		301								Rolmo	Where's your daughter now?	1																					
44	44		201							2	500139		-400																					
45	45		301							1	Kordes	...When we went out to look for supplies, the city was attacked by Corrupted. My daughter... went missing.	2																					
46	46		301								Kordes	When I got back, all I saw were ruins and corpses. The seedlings I wanted so desperately to plant with my daughter were also destroyed.	2																					
47	47		301								Kordes	I looked everywhere, but I never found her.	2																					
48	48		301								Kordes	I later heard she was rescued by ground forces. But with how many casualties the army has suffered, I don't know how many people are still alive... I haven't been able to find anyone else in the ground forces.	2																					
49	49		201							1	500136		400																					
50	50		301							1	Zack	Wherever they appear, it's likely to be a battlefield. We can't always run the risk of getting too close.	1																					
51	51		301								Kordes	After such a long time, I was about to give up... But I heard that people can see their separated family members in the Red Tide, so I insisted on going despite Zack and Kordes objecting. But when I got there, I didn't find her. And I even caused...	2																					
52	52		301								Zack	That's all in the past. The most important thing is that we're still alive.	1																					
53	53		201							2	500384		-400																					
54	54		301							1	Rolmo	You should be happy you didn't see your daughter in it. There's nothing good about the Red Tide.	2																					
55	55		301								Zack	...	1																					
56	56		202							1	2				1																			
57	57		201							1	500140																							
58	58		301							1	"Beardy"	Maybe you can ask about your daughter when we get to the conservation area. Don't give up.	1																					
59	59		301								"Beardy"	...And I heard there's a place in the conservation area for growing crops. We can have a stable and safe place to call home, then you can make your daughter's wishes come true.	1																					
60	60		301									Zack pats Kordes on the shoulder in silent consolation.																						
61	61		301									Kordes stands up with a bitter smile and puts the bag of seeds back into his breast pocket.																						
62	62		203							1	0.25	400																						
63	63		201							2	500139		-400																					
64	64		301							1	Kordes	If we can even get out of this place alive, that is.	2																					
65	65		301								"Beardy"	Let's go. This ain't the first time we've had our lives on the line.	1																					
66	66		202							1	2				1																			
67	67		301									"Rolmo" hesitates for some time, unsure of what to say.																						
68	68		201							1	500384																							
69	69		301				RImgBg1Shake			1	Rolmo	If...	1																					
70	70		401							2	1506																							
71	71		401							1	203																							
72	72		301									A sudden roar interrupts Rolmo. The steel frame overhead groans as if being pushed by brute force. The whole tower shakes violently from the rapid growth of plants.																						
73	73		401							2	1508																							
74	74		301									It seems that time within the tower is being fast-forwarded. The unprecedented plant growth causes the floors to crack from erosion. The invading plants begin to gradually pry open the sealed iron door. The group can hear the monsters hissing outside.																						
75	75		201							1	500136																							
76	76		301							1	Zack	Behind you!	1																					
77	77		301									Zack quickly points his gun in Rolmo's direction and shouts to him in reminder.																						
78	78		301									Rolmo looks back hurriedly to see that the previously closed elevator doors are now teaming with tiny scarlet vines, like nerves and blood vessels spreading on the wall.																						
79	79		301									A split second later, the elevator opens quietly. Several scarlet branches stretch out from within, quickly latching on to the legs of the nearest person.																						
80	80		201							1	500384																							
81	81		301							1	Rolmo	AHH!	1																					
82	82		301									It all happens within the blink of an eye. Zack curses and aims at the branches, but doesn't shoot out of fear of shooting Rolmo.																						
83	83		301									The struggling refugee is dragged to the edge of the elevator. Rolmo latches onto the elevator door, which hasn't fully opened. He sees the deep elevator shaft extend to the depths below him. The infinite darkness is like the ravenous throat of a giant beast.																						
84	84		301								Rolmo	Run upstairs, you fools...	1																					
85	85		202							1					1																			
86	86		301									Before he can finish his sentence, the vine pulls him down into the shaft.																						
87	87		201							1	500140		-600																					
88	88		201							2	500139																							
89	89		201							3	500136		600																					
90	90		301							1	"Beardy"	Damn it!	1																					
91	91		301								Kordes	What do we do now?!	2																					
92	92		301								Zack	You heard him! Get to higher ground!	3																					
93	93		202							1	2	3			1																			
94	94		301									This is a race of great disparity in strength. After losing their guide, the Scavengers have to move on their own.																						
95	95		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					For them, this is no longer a CPF that brings hope to people, but a cave of evil beasts, a place where all fears and disasters are bred.
