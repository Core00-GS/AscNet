10	10		301									He takes off the hood that has been covering his head, shakes his messy long hair, and gives a curtain call to the petite figure sitting in the room.

17	17		301								Roland	I would appreciate it if you could make my exit more dignified.	1																					
18	18		301								Cinderelik	With your ability, Roland, you can leave at any time without my help.	2

23	23		301									She gently nods in understanding, and casts her eyes back to the monitors.																						
24	24		301									This is the location closest to the CPF's centrifuge array as well as the central hub underground. The real "Mother" grows and incubates here, so Cinderelik had transformed it into a greenhouse similar to the underground waterway.																						
25	25		301									A terminal composed of multiple monitors is pieced together in the center of the greenhouse. Each screen displays different images throughout the CPF.																						
26	26		301									The images contain entangled vines, damaged facilities, wandering Hetero-Creatures, and dead bodies quietly drying in the gaps between plants.																						
27	27		301									Most of the screens are static images. Only a few in the middle show signs of human activity.																						
28	28		301									The monitors constantly change as they follow the group's movements from different angles. A peculiar waveform accompanied with data is displayed in the upper right corner of each image.																						
29	29		301									As if confirming the changes of numbers and waveforms, the Hetero-Hive Mother separated by the glass on the other side occasionally sends out violent "fetal movements."

33	33		301								Cinderelik	Mother sees everything.	2																					
34	34		301								Cinderelik	The entire CPF and even the surrounding forest have become an extension of its senses.	2																					
35	35		301									Cinderelik's eyes remain fixated on the flashing images and data on the screen.																						
36	36		301								Monitor Broadcast	"Did Rolmo fall down the elevator?"																						
37	37		301								Monitor Broadcast	"...Into the elevator shaft. With all those strange plants, I'm afraid he's already..."																						
38	38		301								Roland	Hah! Look. They're worried about me.	1																					
39	39		301								Roland	Looks like I've still got it in me.	1																					
40	40		301								Cinderelik	Variables have been introduced into the experiment. Beginning observation.	2																					
41	41		301									In the gray surveillance video, the knotted branches suddenly split, and the red abscesses resemble gelatinous eyes. These exposed red spheres rotate from time to time among the branches, watching from the shadows everything happening inside the tower.																						
42	42		301								Cinderelik	...These "eyes" will relay what they see to Mother. Your mission is complete.	2																					
43	43		204							1																								
44	44		301								Roland	Will these "guests" be helpful to your research?	1																					
45	45		301								Cinderelik	Mother's incubation rate has steadily increased due to the stimulation from outside the CPF and the changing mental state of the humans inside it.	2																					
46	46		301								Cinderelik	The final transformation will complete in approximately 4 hours. After that, incubation will begin.	2																					
47	47		204							1	1																							
48	48		301								Roland	Now that we are almost done, I've got a question about this "Mother". What's going to hatch out of her?	1																					
49	49		301								Cinderelik	This is Gabriel's unfinished business. I don't fully understand it, but I will continue his research based on the information he left behind.	2																					
50	50		301								Roland	Gabriel... It's a pity that Alpha finally got the best of him. Even if his memory shell was more intact, I don't think it's possible to recover all the data.	1																					
51	51		301								Roland	I watched his every move while he tinkered with those Hetero-Creatures. So I know the details of his experiment.	1																					
52	52		301								Roland	I was thinking... If you tell me about "Mother", I'll fill you in on the details.	1																					
53	53		301									Roland smiles and lifts his palms up in a gesture of sincerity.																						
54	54		301								Roland	We're in this together, you know... I think it's a fair trade.	1																					
55	55		301								Roland	Speaking of which... I've seen Gabriel repair Hetero-Creatures broken beyond recognition. His skill and technology... really amazes me.	1																					
56	56		301									Cinderelik looks up at Roland. A touch of emotion flashes in her dark gold eyes.																						
57	57		301								Cinderelik	Der Meister... told me a story.	2																					
58	58		301								Cinderelik	A group of greedy adventurers awoke a slumbering demon while stealing the treasure in its lair underground. When the demon woke up, he saw that humans were weak and greedy, and decided to reshape the world...	2																					
59	59		301								Roland	Oh?	1																					
60	60		301								Roland	I see. So these actors are playing the role of those "adventurers." Everything in this tower is a play for "Mother", is that right?	1																					
61	61		204							1																								
62	62		301								Roland	...As for me. I'm also an actor in this performance. Correct?	1																					
63	63		301								Cinderelik	Der Meister's exact words were, "Let Mother witness humanity's potential."	2																					
64	64		301								Cinderelik	He said you are the hunter now.	2																					
65	65		301									Roland pauses for a moment, then bursts out laughing.																						
66	66		204							1	1																							
67	67		301								Roland	Then I really need to thank him for looking at it from my perspective.	1																					
68	68		301								Cinderelik	Perhaps it would be easier to just show you Gabriel's recordings.	2																					
69	69		301									No longer paying attention to Roland, Cinderelik reaches out to the terminal.
