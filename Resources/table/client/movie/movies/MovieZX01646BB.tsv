11	10		301							1	Liv	We've discovered a colossal creature here. We're unsure how to get near it yet.	2																					
12	11		301								Murray	No worries. There should be a transport pod from the old factories where you guys are. You can give that a shot.	1																					
13	501		302								A transport pod?	502

17	13		301								Murray	I just found a map of this underground city, so I've marked a concealed entry for you guys.	1

26	23		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Liv	Analysis complete. There were two faint sounds in the background during the call.	2																					
27	24		301								Liv	One came from the cries of Hetero-Creatures, the other the sound of the wind.	2																					
28	25		301								Lee	I see. That Murray was indeed an imposter.	1																					
29	26		302								I knew something was wrong.	27																						
30	27		301								Lee	The transport pod is quite possibly just another trap.	1																					
31	28		301								Liv	If it was not Murray, who is it?	2																					
32	29		301								Liv	I remember Commandant mentioning an Ascendant who can turn invisible and shapeshift...	2																					
33	30		302								Lamia.	31
