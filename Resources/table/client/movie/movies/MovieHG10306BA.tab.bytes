4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Lee	I've used the terminal to clear some of the caches. I'll do a more thorough checkup later, so just stay here and don't move.	1																					
5	5		301								Lee	Regardless of what Commandant thinks, you've been pushing yourself too hard recently, Liv.	1																					
6	6		301								Lee	You carry everything on your shoulders‚Äîcombat, preparations, even Commandant's documents were taken care of by you.	1																					
7	7		301								Lee	I know we're Constructs, but we still need some time off for ourselves. The way you've been going...	1

9	9		301							1	Liv	I can take care of myself!	1

11	11		301							1	Lee	Sigh.	1																					
12	12		301								Lee	Right, Commandant, I'll leave this to you.	1																					
13	13		302								Are you leaving?	14	I'll try my best.	15																				
14	14	16	301								Lee	This is a tactical retreat...	1																					
15	15		301								Lee	Don't let me down.	1																					
16	16		201							1	500021																							
17	17		301							1	Liv	I'm sorry... for losing my temper in front of you, Commandant. I'll write a review report...	1																					
18	18		302								What is this actually about?	19	Why are you forcing yourself to work?	19																				
19	19		301								Liv	...	1																					
20	20		301								Liv	I don't want you to think of me as someone weak... b-but...	1																					
21	21		301								Liv	I'm scared that the war will end...	1																					
22	22		302								Isn't the ending of the war a good thing?	23	Do you want the war to continue?	24																				
23	23	25	301								Liv	Of course it's a good thing. There will be no more deaths, no more crying...	1																					
24	24		301								Liv	Of course not... but I'm scared...	1																					
25	25		301								Liv	Since the Punishing Virus appeared and the war broke out...	1																					
26	26		301								Liv	I've been in a repeating cycle of loss and gain, and gradually, I've started to get used to this loop...	1																					
27	27		301								Liv	And every time I'm by myself, I'll close my eyes, and I'll wonder...	1																					
28	28		301								Liv	Who will I be when the war is over...? If I don't stop working, I won't need to question myself...	1																					
29	29		302								We'll think about that when the time comes.	30	We'll search for the answer then. Together.	30																				
30	30		301								Liv	But when the time comes...	1

32	32		301							1	Lucia	Commandant's right. We might have been created for war, but we don't have to stay in it forever.	1																					
33	33		301								Lucia	But it's still too far away to think about where we'll go when the war ends...	1																					
34	34		301								Lucia	Instead of the distant future, I'm more interested in what we can do, what we want to do, here and now.	1																					
35	35		301								Lucia	So, Liv, what do you want to do at this moment?	1																					
36	36		201							1	500021																							
37	37		301							1	Liv	I... I...	1
