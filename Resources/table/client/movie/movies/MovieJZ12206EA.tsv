4	4		301			DialogEnable					Announcement	"After investigation, the desertion charge held against Construct soldier Lloyd has been lifted. The headquarters has identified his action as tactical breakthrough."																						
5	5		301								Announcement	"Lloyd used discretion and decided the situation was impossible for the entire Construct troop to safely escape. He single-handedly broke through the encirclement in order to distract the Corrupted and seek reinforcements."																						
6	6		301								Announcement	"Due to unknown communication interference, Lloyd was unable to contact the HQ and was hence incorrectly marked as a deserter."																						
7	7		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Announcement	"We have confirmed that Lloyd managed to recall at the last moment but his M.I.N.D. was significantly damaged. He will undergo a lengthy recovery and..."

16	16		301									Finally, an incoming communication cuts the awkward atmosphere.																						
17	17		301									Nikola glances at Vera and picks up the phone.

21	21		301							1	Nikola	Nikola speaking... What is it?	1																					
22	22		301								Celica	Um, Commander... Remember that guy named Collins, who looks like great trouble? He's here again. Should I still tell him off this time?	2																					
23	23		301									Nikola rubs his eyebrows. He looks extremely annoyed.																						
24	24		301								Nikola	No need. Let him wait in the meeting room. I'll be there in a sec.	1

27	27		301									After hanging up, Nikola looks at Vera again, but this time he starts to talk.																						
28	28		201							1	500012		400																					
29	29		201							2	500168		-400																					
30	30		301							1	Nikola	Your action was beyond the mission scope and was completely unauthorized.	1																					
31	31		204							2	1																							
32	32		301								Vera	Really? As far as I can remember, I only promised you to get the job done. Everything apart from the mission objective is up to me.	2																					
33	33		301								Nikola	I could turn a blind eye in the past, but this time you have crossed the line. I still need to clean up the mess you left.	1																					
34	34		301								Nikola	By rescuing those Constructs, you made the situation unnecessarily complicated and exposed the new frame way too early...	1																					
35	35		301									Vera's new frame is still unregistered. Ever since that operation, it was temporarily banned from service to avoid troubles.																						
36	36		204							2																								
37	37		301								Vera	That's your job to fix, not mine.	2																					
38	38		301								Nikola	Really? You could have died there. Just why did you do that...?	1																					
39	39		202							1	2				1																			
40	40		301									Vera smiles again. She turns back and opens the door.																						
41	41		201							1	500168	1																						
42	42		301							1	Vera	Who knows? Maybe I just wanted to be a "hero" for once?	1																					
43	43		201							1	500012																							
44	44		301							1	Nikola	Hero...	1																					
45	45		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Nikola shakes his head and closes Lloyd's archive on his desk. He sighs, then falls into a long silence.

48	48		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Vera walks out of Nikola's office and leans on the corridor. She pulls out the remaining half of her katana and starts laughing at herself.																						
49	49		201							1	500168	1																						
50	50		301							1	Vera	How ridiculous. What am I even doing...?	1																					
51	51		301									Nikola was absolutely right. Illogical actions would only lead to unreasonable consequences. Vera is completely unfit to be a banner to guide others, and nobody knows this better than herself.																						
52	52		301									This banner only leads to a road to hell, full of thorns, pain and death...																						
53	53		201							1	500359																							
54	54		301							1	???	But at least you took them back from Death this time. This banner of yours never wavered. It saved everybody.	1																					
55	55		201							1	500168	1																						
56	56		301							1		Vera smiles and puts the broken katana back in the sheath.																						
57	57		301								Vera	At least I'm not regretting my choice... for now.	1																					
58	58		201							1	500359																							
59	59		301							1	???	Even without that banner, you already have followers that believe in you.	1																					
60	60		202							1					1																			
61	61		301									Right. Vera is no longer "Death" from Kurono. Now, she is the Captain of Cerberus.																						
62	62		201							1	500168	1																						
63	63		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Vera	Better go back now. Those two may have already blown the lounge up.	1

66	66		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Many Constructs are talking behind Vera's back as she walks back to the Cerberus lounge. Although not officially reported, the rumors about her killing "The Undying Loy" still become widespread.																						
67	67		301									People mourn for the fall of the hero and condemn the ruthless "Death". However, some are also grateful to Vera.																						
68	68		301									They are the Construct soldiers that were trapped in the previous operation. Vera saved their lives. It is a fact.																						
69	69		201							1	500250																							
70	70		301							1	Injured Construct	Miss Vera, please take these flowers... We'd like to thank you.	1																					
71	71		301									A Construct soldier hands Vera a bouquet of bionic flowers and nods with a smile.																						
72	72		201							1	500019		-400																					
73	73		201							2	500028		400																					
74	74		301							1	Construct Captain	Without you, we would have been wiped out long ago.	2																					
75	75		301								Construct Soldier	You probably also had your reasons to kill Lloyd...	1																					
76	76		301									But Vera did not even look at them. She just takes the bouquet and throws it on the ground.																						
77	77		202							1	2				1																			
78	78		201							1	500168																							
79	79		301							1	Vera	You may have some misunderstandings. I'm no hero, and I only saved you because that was my job. You don't have to fawn on me.	1																					
80	80		301									Vera gives them a cold stare, then smiles.																						
81	81		204							1	13																							
82	82		301								Vera	Killing Lloyd was also just a mission. Whoever appears on my mission list, I will not hesitate to kill them. Maybe you will be my next target.	1																					
83	83		204							1																								
84	84		301									Vera's stare makes them cower and retreat.																						
85	85		301									—That's good. I'm not a hero, and never will I be.																						
86	86		301									Vera walks away without looking back. Just when she is about to step on the bouquet, she picks it up and throws it back to the soldiers with a smile.																						
87	87		301								Vera	Better save this for the real "hero" who saves you...	1																					
88	88		301									Maybe one day, another hero named "Lloyd" will show up again. Maybe he no longer remembers what happened in the past, but as long as he is carrying the name of "Lloyd", he will make the same decision.																						
89	89		204							1	1																							
90	90		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Vera	—Don't forget to smile to him and say "thank you."	1
