6	6		301									Lucia can see Luna through the transparent Energy Core at the top of the Polyphage.																						
7	7		301									The revelation that Luna was an Ascendant during their encounter in the Kowloong Metropolis had Lucia shaken back then. Her thoughts tangled up in her M.I.N.D. like a disordered ball of yarn.																						
8	8		301									The Ascendant who could manipulate the Punishing Virus was a far cry from the little girl who held her hand. Her idea of her "sister" has since become uncertain and fractured.																						
9	9		301									It is only until now that Lucia has a chance to take a closer look at the Luna in the present.																						
10	10		301									Her pale cheeks are almost translucent, her brows frowned, her lips spurting brief and repressed gasps.																						
11	11		301									She no longer finds the little girl that has been refitted, then reshaped by the virus, and then evolved. But Lucia knows this expression. It is one she found on Luna's face when she slept alone.																						
12	12		301									She would sleep with her battered doll on a cold bed, waiting for her sister as she scavenged for food. She always looked lonely and scared, her eyelashes dotted with tears of fear as if a nightmare was haunting her.																						
13	13		301									But if she hugged her and held her hand tightly, the little girl would smile with ease, readily falling asleep again in her sister's arms.																						
14	14		301									Now, Luna is trapped in a chamber akin to a cultivation pod, her eyes shut, her limbs bounded by the hunting claws of the Polyphage. She is so close, and yet so far away.																						
15	15		301									Even with all her power as an "agent," she can still look so fragile.																						
16	16		301									An unspeakable pain tears through Lucia's heart. She cannot help calling out her name.

20	20		302								This is the source of the Polyphage's power!	21																						
21	21		302								We have to separate her from the Core first!	22

23	23		301									Lucia nods and raises her katana, ready to thrust it into the Core. But then‚Äî

26	26		301									Like a violent storm, a biting scythe cuts across Lucia's right arm in the blink of an eye, launching her to the edge of the platform that contains the Polyphage's Core.																						
27	27		301									The ashen Hetero-Creature that appeared next to Gabriel is now descending from the air, hovering before Lucia with its wings spread.

29	29		301							1	Lucia	Get out of my way!	1																					
30	30		301			PanelActor1Shake						Lucia swings at the creature, but it counters her strike with the same attack at almost the same angle. The Hetero-Creature may even have the upper hand when it comes to a contest of pure strength.																						
31	31		301								Lucia	It's mimicking my move...	1																					
32	32		302								Incredible photographic reflexes...	33																						
33	33		301									No one knows if the Hetero-Creature born from the Punishing Virus is "self-aware," but...																						
34	34		301								Lucia	It's pointless if you can only copy what's on the surface.	1																					
35	35		301									Lucia takes a deep breath and adjusts her grip. Then she displays an unfamiliar battle stance, one in the vein of several different Constructs she knows, without strictly adhering to one.																						
36	36		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Let me demonstrate with my blade‚Äîand then I will destroy you!	1
