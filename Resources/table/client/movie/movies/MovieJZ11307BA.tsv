14	14		301									The dark subway station is paved with bodies. Standing in front of a Corrupted, as if mocking it, is a redheaded girl.																						
15	15		301									The Corrupted charges towards Vera. The spikes on the ground shoot out like bullets, forcing Vera to back up into a run-down wall.

27	24		301									Vera unloads the preservation pod holding the Corrupted Tifa in a corridor. Without a thought to any repercussions, she connects Tifa to power.																						
28	25		301									With her brain damaged, the only place she can show her bewilderment is through the screen on top of the pod. Tifa's battered form is now no more than a coffin imprisoning her consciousness.																						
29	26		301									On the screen, Tifa exhibits panic and regret. Through the connection established by Gray Raven, she is forced to remember all that happened between her and her Commandant.																						
30	27		301									And understand what she did wrong.																						
31	28		301				DialogDisable					Vera strokes Tifa's cheek, as if comforting her.

36	32		301								Vera	I know you're crying, Tifa. Now that you've regained your humanity, you can feel pain.																						
37	33		301								Tifa	Commandant... Why... Why do they have a Commandant while my... my Commandant...																						
38	34		301								Vera	Those who don't feel pain are not actually alive. Without pain, you can't prove that you exist.																						
39	35		301								Vera	My mission is to kill Tifa. And Tifa, you exist right here, right now.																						
40	36		301									Vera places a gentle hand on Tifa's cheek comfortingly.																						
41	37		301								Vera	And that's why I'll give you a way out. Leave all your pain to me—just like how everyone else did.																						
42	38		301								Vera	That's all I can do for you, Tifa.																						
43	39		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					—And then Vera raises her hand. She punches straight through Tifa's brain and the pod, crushing it all.
