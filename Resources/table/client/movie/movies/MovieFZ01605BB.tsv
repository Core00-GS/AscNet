9	10		301							1	Lamia	Let's just toss her to those guys that are snooping around... Do you think it's worth it?	2																					
10	11		301								Gabriel	She's no use to us if she stays here either.	1																					
11	12		301								Gabriel	She passed the first round of filtering and maintained her ego just as I expected, but then she refuses to dive deeper into the Ascension-Network.	1																					
12	13		301								Gabriel	The thing is, she refuses to leave either. She just wants to stay down there in that room.	1																					
13	14		301									The two gaze at the faltering Liadrin. Another squad of Constructs marches in from afar and stops her.																						
14	15		301								Lamia	She's been underground for too long. Her mind is all jumbled up.	2																					
15	16		301								Gabriel	This is what happens to those who can't get over their pain.	1																					
16	17		301								Gabriel	Let her deal with this. We have other things to do.	1																					
17	18		202							1	2				1																			
18	19		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The two on the roof quickly depart, leaving the badly injured Liadrin to face the entire squad of Constructs.

21	22		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Construct Member	Commandant, she's the murderer that slaughtered the other squad.	3																					
22	23		301									Hearing those words, Liadrin dully looks up. Standing next to the Construct is a human female. It looks like she is communicating with someone else.																						
23	24		301								Female Commandant	Sister, I found her.																						
24	25		301									Her voice sounds very much like Angel's. Liadrin raises her head as if she has just woken up from a nightmare. She mindlessly repeats that word.																						
25	26		201							1	500250																							
26	27		301							1	Liadrin	Sister...?	1																					
27	28		301									She turns around and stares intently at the human.																						
28	29		301								Female Commandant	Don't worry, sis. She's badly wounded. I have the situation under control. I'll go back with you after this mission.																						
29	30		301								Liadrin	With you...	1																					
30	31		301								Liadrin	I'll be with you...	1																					
31	32		201							1	500028																							
32	33		301							1	Construct Member	She's coming at us!	1																					
33	34		301								Female Commandant	Prepare for battle!																						
34	35		301									The Constructs quickly spread out around Liadrin at the commandant's order.																						
35	36		301									A towering Construct steps up and releases a shield, blocking the spikes that Liadrin formed out of thin air.																						
36	37		401							2	10007502																							
37	38		301			RImgBg1Shake						A long-haired Construct pokes her head out from behind the shield and throws a small cube at Liadrin, creating a small-scale explosion. The smoke from it blocks Liadrin's sight and hinders her movement.																						
38	40		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The Construct with a hand crossbow stands a little further away. Seeing Liadrin clearly through his thermal goggles, he unleashes a power-infused arrow at the smoke.

42	44		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Liadrin	Ahhhhhhhh!	1																					
43	45		301			RImgBg1Shake				1		Her harsh wailing resounds once more. The Constructs cover their ears and assume a defensive stance.																						
44	46		201							1	500028																							
45	47		301							1	Construct Member	She's gone berserk!	1																					
46	48		201							1	500250																							
47	49		301							1	Liadrin	Angel... Angel... Angel...	1																					
48	50		301									Liadrin staggers out of the smoke. Her right chest has been pierced.																						
49	51		201							1	500028																							
50	52		301							1	Construct Member	Protect the commandant!	1																					
51	53		201							1	500250																							
52	54		301							1	Liadrin	No, that won't be necessary. I will protect her myself... like I used to...	1																					
53	55		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryGanRanNew.prefab		1																						
54	56		301									The harsh shriek is heard again. A hideous red electric current wraps around Liadrin and forms a rugged blood moon at her feet.																						
55	57		301								Female Commandant	Sister, this mission might be trickier than I thought.																						
56	58		301								Liadrin	I won't let you go this time!	1																					
57	59		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryGanRanNew.prefab		1																					
58	60		201							1	500165																							
59	61		301							1	Lamia	...I thought I should check up on her. What a nuisance.	1																					
60	62		301									The Construct squad is inexperienced, but Liadrin's wound is also greatly limiting her power.																						
61	63		301								Lamia	...I didn't really have much expectation.	1																					
62	64		202							1					1																			
63	65		301									Besides, Liadrin is carefully trying to avoid hurting her "sister."																						
64	66		301									Lamia lets out a sigh and approaches the battle from the shadows.																						
65	67		301									The Construct just barely dodged Liadrin's continuous attack and are trying to catch their breath.																						
66	68		301									But Liadrin is also worn out. Even if they leave her alone, she probably will not survive without help.																						
67	69		201							1	500165		400																					
68	72		201							2	500019		-400																					
69	70		301							1	Lamia	Perfect timing.	1																					
70	71		301									Lamia sneaks behind the solo crossbow Construct and impales his chest with a single strike.																						
71	73		301								Crossbow Construct	...Youâ€”	2																					
72	74		401							2	1503																							
73	75		301			RImgBg1Shake						Just when he attempts to warn the others, a rumbling sound is heard underground.																						
74	76		204							1	1																							
75	77		301								Lamia	Dinner time?	1																					
76	78		202							1	2				1																			
77	79		301									Lamia's lips curve up with satisfaction. She twists her body and vanishes. By the time she reappears, the other two Constructs have been eliminated as well.																						
78	80		201							1	500165																							
79	81		301							1	Lamia	You're the only one left?	1																					
80	82		301									Although her entire squad is down, the female commandant still tries to stay calm. She keeps communicating her situation as she retreats.																						
81	83		301								Female Commandant	Sister, the enemy has backup. I've lost my squad. You need to retreat!																						
82	84		401							2	1503																							
83	85		301									The rumbling sound from underground is quickly approaching, but the female commandant pays no attention to it. Compared to the mysterious rumbling, the two standing in front of her pose more of a threat.																						
84	86		201							1	500250																							
85	87		301							1	Liadrin	Don't leave... Don't leave!	1																					
86	88		301									Even though the commandant is fleeing as fast as she can, Liadrin still struggles toward her with a broken body.																						
87	89		201							1	500165	8																						
88	90		301							1	Lamia	...Looks like I won't have to get my hands dirty.	1

91	93		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cg1601_7.jpg																								
92	95		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The rumbling sound charges at the female commandant. As soon as she shouts out those words, a huge crimson wave tears apart the ground and gushes out from below, swallowing her and the Constructs lying on the ground like a ruthless predator.																						
93	96		301								Lamia	I don't expect you to thank me. Just get yourself looked at, will you?																						
94	97		301									Liadrin does not respond. She painfully gropes around in the Red Tide, searching for something.																						
95	98		301								Liadrin	Angel... Angel!																						
96	99		301								Lamia	You'll die if you keep doing this stuff.																						
97	100		301								Liadrin	No! Nooooooo! Angel!																						
98	101		301								Lamia	...Forget it.																						
99	102		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Liadrin keeps floundering in the Red Tide even after Lamia vanishes, until it begins to recede toward its original exit.																						
100	103		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory286.png																								
101	104		201							1	500250

103	106		301								???	...Sister...																						
104	107		301									Liadrin turns around at the familiar voice. A blurry projection emerges out of the Red Tide. It vaguely resembles the female commandant's features.

110	113		301							1	Liadrin	Angel!	1																					
111	114		301									She ecstatically throws herself at the Red Tide projection, but no matter how hard she tries, it is impossible to hold it in her arms.																						
112	115		301								Liadrin	Angel! Why?!	1																					
113	116		301									Her crying still does not trigger anything. Liadrin can only watch as the projection and the Red Tide rapidly flow toward the crack in the ground.

119	122		301							1	Liadrin	Don't go!	1																					
120	123		301									She drags her mortally wounded body along the path and chases after the Red Tide like a blind person trying to grab hold of the last light in sight.																						
121	124		301								Liadrin	Don't go!!!!!!!!	1																					
122	125		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Before the Red Tide completely retreats underground, Liadrin finally catches up to the projection. She smiles joyfully and jumps in with her arms wide openâ€”
