7	7		301							1	Rosetta	If you mean the commandant—currently testing the command system.	2																					
8	8		301								Asimov	Oh boy, that's trouble... Forget it, I'll go look...	1																					
9	9		204							2	4																							
10	10		301								Rosetta	Wait! What do you mean by trouble?	2																					
11	11		301								Asimov	You wouldn't understand anyway.	1																					
12	12		301								Rosetta	Then please explain in a way that I can. Aren't you an expert at that?	2																					
13	13		301								Asimov	Sigh, fine... I found code for an early prototype of a M.I.N.D. system in the system shell.	1																					
14	14		301								Asimov	After all, most of the systems developed by the ARU at this time were like this—for example, the mech narwhal. So, I didn't pay much attention to it.	1																					
15	15		301								Asimov	But recently, when I checked the noise mixed in the AI voice used in "Virtual Horizon", I discovered that it was actually an encrypted waveform file.	1																					
16	16		301								Rosetta	A waveform file...?	2																					
17	17		301								Asimov	Like electromagnetic waves, seismic waves, or most commonly—sound.	1																					
18	18		301								Rosetta	Can you convert the waveform into sound and play it for me?	2																					
19	19		401							2	1515																							
20	20		301									Asimov sends the translated waveform audio to Rosetta.																						
21	21		301								Asimov	Sure, of course. But I've already tried that. It doesn't appear to have any meaning...	1																					
22	22		301								Rosetta	"Lonely. World. Loop. Eternal. Dream. 【kuroname】... My dream.. dream... dream..."	2																					
23	23		301								Asimov	What's wrong?	1																					
24	24		301								Rosetta	It's the meaning of the audio—Derek's voice... It contains some simple words, but it mentions the commandant...	2																					
25	25		301								Asimov	It's not a message that a simple AI guide can convey.	1																					
26	26		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Rosetta	Looks like my hunch was right... Take me to the commandant!	2
