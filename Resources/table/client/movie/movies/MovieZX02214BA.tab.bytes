4	4		301									The large transport craft mentioned in the transmission finally appears in the form of the burning carcass of a plane, crash-landing before the teams that retrieved the sample of the Hetero-Hive Mother.																						
5	5		301									Eventually, the different teams could only manage to save the pilot, and they begin their retreat on foot.																						
6	6		301									But they see the same thing regardless of where they go: a crumbled CPF tower, farms burned down, and the lingering stench in the air like the smell of white phosphorous burning through flesh.																						
7	7		301									These disasters from the Punishing Virus have never left Earth. More and more people join the retreating forces; they abandon the well-constructed defense lines and conservation areas, moving the frontline back.																						
8	8		301									To live, people are giving up on the rebuilt houses, the unwieldy weapons, and the stored rations. Everything they built is now given up for survival; all they can do now is search for survivors.

16	17		301									Every step she is taking stresses her frame. The feeling of pain spreads from her feet to her entire body, but that does not stop her from moving forward.

20	21		301									After settling „Äêkuroname„Äë and the rest, Liv returns to the front of the rescue line.																						
21	23		301									Her mind is way too foggy to know how many times she has performed first-aid and moved the wounded.																						
22	24		301								Wounded Survivor	I... need water...																						
23	25		301									The survivor makes a plea. His voice was weak, but resolute in his last request. Hearing that, Liv immediately takes him to one of the last few water supply points within the ruins.																						
24	26		301									But the water at the supply point is already murky and stained. The survivor on her shoulders never got to take a sip of water from his homeland before he passes.																						
25	27		301									They were talking just a second ago. Now, they are a life apart.																						
26	28		301									In the blink of an eye, a life passes away next to Liv, quietly.																						
27	29		301									Even with all the treatment she can do, Liv still cannot save this life from the call of death.

30	32		301									Ever since she has become a medic, Liv has been in the company of death. She should be used to the fact that she cannot save everyone by now.																						
31	33		301									But, regrettably, she can still remember every name on the casualty list and the desperation she felt as they passed. In the face of death, Liv cannot become accustomed to it.																						
32	34		301									The wounded cannot wait. Liv adjusts her emotions before she continues searching in the ruins like a machine.																						
33	35		301									At least she will not miss the next one.

43	45		301									Another crumbled wall has been moved. Liv wipes away the dust covering the face of the injured buried underneath, finding a small Construct, her short, white hair darkened from the fire, stained with vital fluid and blood.

54	56		301									Seeing the girl's face, Liv remembers a past memory.																						
55	57		301									In the memory, Liv was lowering her voice to comfort the girl before her, as Liv was the last one facing the massive Corrupted that destroyed the city.																						
56	58		301								Liv	Stay quiet. I'll count to three, and you run toward the hill, okay?	2																					
57	59		301									The girl looked at Liv and nodded.

59	61		301									In that distant past, the army was also retreating like they are now, giving up on the districts one after another.																						
60	62		301									During that retreat, Liv saved the little girl that was at a similar age to when Liv enlisted, adorned with silver hair like her.

65	67		301							1		As she sees the girl who got turned into a Construct and got injured on the battlefield of despair, Liv begins to feel a sense of familiarity. A question rises in her mind.																						
66	68		301									Did I really save her...?																						
67	69		301									The last time she saw the girl, she was alive, direct in her expressions and fear.																						
68	70		301									This time, she is another chilling Construct like her, having trekked through countless battlefields.																						
69	71		301									Having saved her from a hopeless battlefield, Liv has delivered her to countless wars to confront death.																						
70	72		301									What will she think when she is about to die? Will she want to go home like she once did?																						
71	73		301									If death is inevitable, should they not suffer as little as possible?																						
72	74		301									Can I really save everyone...? Does anything that I do mean anything?																						
73	75		301									Is this really salvation in this ocean of pain?

77	79		301									Everyone has fulfilled their duties as soldiers to their dying breath.																						
78	80		301									But now, so much is lost.																						
79	81		301									A breeze blows past the battlefield, sending a bag of hydrangea seeds from the little girl's arms to Liv.																						
80	82		301									What flower will blossom, and what fruit will they bear when the seeds are planted?																						
81	83		301									No one will know. The farmers are gone. The farms are lost.																						
82	84		301									That bag is damaged by the fire of war, the seeds soaked in blood and fuel.																						
83	85		301									Liv looks at the hills of remains before her.																						
84	86		301									She knows this scene exists not only here.

94	96		301									There is a higher mountain after this one.																						
95	97		301									Another battlefield after this war is over.																						
96	98		301									As long as the Punishing Virus exists on Earth, nothing will be fixed.																						
97	99		301									It is a Sisyphean struggle, where momentary calmness is easily shattered the next moment.																						
98	100		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					How will humanity break this endless cycle?
