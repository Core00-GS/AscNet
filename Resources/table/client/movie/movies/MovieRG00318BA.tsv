3	3		301			DialogEnable				1		We met many other Demons underground. Interestingly, there seemed to be two types of Demons.	1																					
4	4		301									Simply speaking, some Demons were like animals. They only attacked out of instinct, and we were unable to communicate with them.																						
5	5		301									And most enemies we met here belonged to this type.

7	6		301							1	Kamui	Alright, I think I know what you had discussed with the King. He obviously is a bug!	1																					
8	7		301									As we moved together, Lucia also explained what they had encountered in the game.																						
9	8		301									What concerned me the most was still that King. He didn't feel like a game character at all.	(Look around)

11	9		301							1	Lee	He was manipulating the heroes using the game mechanics, and had a clear objective.	1																					
12	1005		302								And he looked like Hassen.	1001	Was he a bug caused by Celica's modifications?	1002																				
13	1001	10	201							1	1081001																							
14	10	1006	301							1	Kamui	Yeah, it feels really weird to see him. I thought Celica would use the other guy's face.		1

16	11	1006	301							1	Kamui	Hmm... I'm not too sure, but usually bugs are major problems that make the game unplayable. I don't think he is one of them.		1

21	13		301							1	Lucia	I know it's only a game... But I don't want to do things that may bring disasters to this world and the NPCs. And I don't want to give up either.	2																					
22	14		301								Lucia	NPC... They are just programs, but I still have a weird feeling when I see their human faces.	1

25	15		301							1	Kamui	Speaking of that, I remember the ending of a strange game I played before. In the end, the main character found out he was actually in a game, that he was being controlled all along.	1

29	17		301							1	Karenina	Huh? What was that? ...Are you saying you could also be the dreams of a butterfly?	1																					
30	18		301								Lee	I can't deny that. But if that's the case, I really want to know why that butterfly dreamed of things like the Punishing Virus.	2

33	19		301							1	Lucia	Whether we are living in a dream or not doesn't matter. We just need to do our best.	1																					
34	20		301								Lucia	Like, right now we should keep looking for Liv and meet up with her, so we can find out why she was separated from us.	1																					
35	21		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Then we may be able to can find the key to reverse the situation.	1
