25	25		301								Hassen	Our soldiers are still trapped in the Golden Vortex.	1

27	27		201							2	500012		400																					
28	28		301							1	Nikola	The situation is critical on all fronts around the globe. Even with an emergency mobilization, we won't have enough troops for a rescue operation...	2																					
29	29		301								Nikola	Those aren't ordinary soldiers in there. Maybe we should give them some time to... (shrugs) improvise.	2

31	31		301								Hassen	They're running out of time.	1																					
32	32		301								Hassen	Commander, you're better at mobilizing troops than me.	1																					
33	33		301								Hassen	I mean, all I do is bother you all, don't I?	1
