6	6		302								What is it?	7																						
7	7		301								Construct Leader	A Female Construct is looking for you. I'd hate to be on her bad side...	1

12	12		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Qu	I just figured I'd take a shot in the dark. I didn't think you'd actually come.	1																					
13	13		302								I figured I'd be pecked to pieces if I was too slow.	14																						
14	14		301								Qu	...	1																					
15	15		302								Where's the bird?	16																						
16	1005		204							1	14																							
17	16		301								Qu	Huiyu... has gone missing. I haven't seen it since this morning. I came here to look for it.	1																					
18	17		301								Qu	No matter how many times I called for it this morning, it didn't respond to me...	1																					
19	18		302								Maybe it just went out to play?	19																						
20	19		301								Qu	Of course not! It'd never fly away without my permission.	1																					
21	20		301								Qu	Ever since we first met, Huiyu has never left my side! It must be in trouble...	1																					
22	21		302								Let's go look for it...	22																						
23	22		301								Qu	You want to help look for Huiyu?	1																					
24	23		302								It's not like I wanna see it get eaten, now do I?	24																						
25	24		301								Qu	Who knows, maybe we'll be eaten by these uninvited guests instead...	1

28	27		301							1	Corrupted	Rargh!!!!!	1																					
29	28		301									Before you knew it, both of you are surrounded by Corrupted.																						
30	29		201							1	500150																							
31	30		301							1	Qu	I didn't want to get my feet dirty...	1																					
32	31		301									Qu glances at you.																						
33	32		301								Qu	Looks like we have no other option but to fight.	1																					
34	33		302								Sorry...	34																						
35	34		301								Qu	No need to apologize. Aren't we partners?	1																					
36	35		302								Yeah, got that right!	36																						
37	36		301								Qu	Let's get this over and done with.	1																					
38	37		301									Qu quickly kicks the three nearest Corrupted with silken grace. The Corrupted collapses onto the ground, unable to move.																						
39	38		302								Impressive...	39																						
40	39		301								Qu	What are you staring at? Get moving!	1																					
41	40		302								Watch out!	41																						
42	41		301									The downed Corrupted grabs Qu's feet and seems to still have some fight left in it.																						
43	42		301								Qu	This body... is too weak!	1																					
44	43		301									Just as another Corrupted is about to pounce on Qu, a human knocks it out of the way.			1																			
45	44		302								Qu!	45																						
46	45		301									Realizing what happened, Qu lifts her foot to crush the Corrupted that is clinging to her before sending the one you intercepted flying with a swift kick, all while grabbing your hand to run away in one motion.																						
47	46		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	Let's go!	1

50	49		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After shaking off the Corrupted, the two of you finally make it to the center of the Nighter. Several Corrupted lie on the ground motionless.																						
51	50		302								What happened here, Qu?	51																						
52	51		201							1	500150																							
53	52		301							1	Qu	Looks like they were all pecked to pieces by Huiyu... Seems like it flew through here.	1																					
54	53		302								Looks like Huiyu went easy on me...	54																						
55	54		301								Qu	Hmph... Huiyu is smart enough to tell who my real enemies are.	1																					
56	55		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	Looks like we should be able to find Huiyu by following the trail of Corrupted.	1

58	57		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory169.png																								
59	58		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You hear Huiyu squawk in the distance—along with the roars of Corrupted.																						
60	59		302								Huiyu is being attacked by Corrupted!	60																						
61	60		201							1	500150																							
62	61		301							1	Qu	Take this!	1																					
63	62		301									Qu quickly flips into the air and performs a dive kick onto the ground. The powerful shockwave sends all the Corrupted surrounding Huiyu flying into the air.																						
64	63		301								Qu	Huiyu!	1																					
65	64		301									Following up the attack, Huiyu flies over to Qu to aid her in a powerful aerial kick, annihilating all of the Corrupted.																						
66	65		202							1					1																			
67	66		301									Huiyu surveys the area to make sure all of the Corrupted have been defeated before returning to where it has originally been surrounded.																						
68	67		301									At that moment, Qu discovers that there is another bionic peacock exactly like Huiyu.																						
69	68		201							1	500150																							
70	69		301							1	Qu	Jiaogong...	1																					
71	70		302								There are two Huiyus?	71																						
72	71		301								Qu	That's Jiaogong... It's Huiyu's companion model.	1																					
73	72		301									One of Jiaogong's wings seems to be severely injured. It flaps its other wing in fright at the sight of Qu.																						
74	73		301								Qu	But it chose the wrong master—Villier. He was defeated here by the Gray Ravens, right?	1																					
75	74		302								So... Villier is its master...	75																						
76	75		301									Qu retrieves a blade from a Corrupted and approaches Jiaogong.																						
77	76		301								Qu	Your master, Villier, is dead... It's only right for you to join him in Hell.	1																					
78	77		301									However, Huiyu is standing guard over Jiaogong. Even in the face of Qu, it refuses to back down.																						
79	78		301								Qu	Is that how it is...? Is that your partner, Huiyu...?	1																					
80	79		301									Qu closes her eyes and shakes her head, then gets rid of the blade.																						
81	80		301								Qu	Jiaogong and Huiyu... They... were the only gifts given by my brother to Villier and me long before any of this hatred came to be.	1																					
82	81		301								Qu	We were both just children. We didn't know the weight of our responsibilities, nor did we know who our ideals would hurt.	1																					
83	82		301								Qu	But now I'm alone... Brother and Villier are no longer with me—only Huiyu is by my side.	1																					
84	83		301									Qu seems to let out a sigh of relief, then walks toward you.																						
85	84		301								Qu	Help Jiaogong repair its wing, so that it can continue on its life alone.	1																					
86	85		302								Me?	86																						
87	86		301								Qu	Jiaogong probably won't let me near it. Only you can do it.	1																					
88	87		302								Huiyu won't peck me, will it?	1001	Alright... I'll try my best.	91																				
89	1001		204							1	1																							
90	88		301									Qu couldn't help but grin.	1																					
91	89		301								Qu	Sigh, I still can't tell if you're brave or just a coward... You're my partner. Huiyu won't attack you.	1																					
92	90		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				Alright... I'll try my best.	91

95	93		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Luckily, Lee taught you a thing or two about being a mechanic. Jiaogong's wing is repaired in no time.																						
96	95		302								Alright, give flying a shot.	96																						
97	96		301									Jiaogong stretches its wings to confirm your handiwork, then leaps into the air and flies with ease. Huiyu joins it in flight, and the two proceed to chase each other gleefully.																						
98	97		201							1	500150																							
99	98		301							1	Qu	Machines can be repaired, but for humans—some wounds never heal. It is this fragility that I love so tenderly.	1																					
100	99		301								Qu	Your life is precious. In the future, I hope you won't be so foolish going around helping others without taking yourself into consideration.	1																					
101	100		302								Are you referring to me saving you...?	101																						
102	101		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	You must understand that your life is no longer your own. You are my only partner.	1
