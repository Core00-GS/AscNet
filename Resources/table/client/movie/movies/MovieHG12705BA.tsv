4	4		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The gentle sways of a cradle wake you up. The tender breeze carries with it salted air, and you open your eyes to a bright blue sea.																						
5	5		301									Some people say that all lives on Earth began from the ocean. Back when the air and the land were lethal to all living things, water shielded lives from deadly radiation, giving them a chance to grow.																						
6	6		301									Billions of years of evolution took place in the ocean before chance sent one of its children to the surface with a wave, starting life on the surface.																						
7	7		301									Creatures on the surface have gone through rigorous challenges, adapting to their environment and evolving.																						
8	8		301									The best of their descendants established civilizations on these lands, but these civilizations are still infants compared to the ocean.																						
9	9		301									Now, the ocean is still stretching her arms, embracing and protecting the lone sail that carries Nanami and you.																						
10	10		301									Two fishing rods lean against the side of the boat.																						
11	11		302								We're fishing?	12																						
12	12		201							1	500091	1																						
13	13		301							1	Nanami	Exactly. And Nanami won't be skipping anything this time.	1																					
14	14		301									Nanami takes the fishing rod on the left and says enthusiastically—																						
15	15		301								Nanami	Let's see which one of us can get more fish, Commandant!	1																					
16	16		302								You're not going to cheat, are you?	17	Fishing takes a lot of patience.	18																				
17	17	20	301								Nanami	I won't! There's nothing Nanami cares about more than a fair competition!	1																					
18	18		204							1	8																							
19	19		301								Nanami	Hmph! You've underestimated Nanami, Commandant.	1																					
20	20		202							1					1																			
21	21		301									With that, Nanami casts her fishing line and sits down with her back to you.																						
22	22		301									The ocean breeze gently moves her silver hair. The waves reflect the sunlight onto her profile, shrouding her in ever-shifting colors.																						
23	23		301									She looks focused, serious, and sincere. You have never seen her like this, but you can almost hear a voice within you, saying—																						
24	24		301									This is probably how Nanami looks when she grows up.																						
25	25		201							1	500091	1																						
26	26		301							1	Nanami	Why haven't you started, Commandant?	1																					
27	27		302								Cough...	28																						
28	28		302								I'll be right there.	29																						
29	29		301									You swiftly hook up the fishing bait, and with your grip on the rod, you cast the fishing line—																						
30	30		202							1					1																			
31	31		301									It creates a small splash. The fishing bobber floats and drifts along the waves, and you sit down as well.																						
32	32		302								(Focus)	33																						
33	33		301				AniZhuanchangBegin		500			You lock your gaze onto the bobber, paying attention to every slight movement—																						
34	34		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You always lose track of time whenever you narrow your sight to one single thing. If it does not change, your drifting thoughts will instead extend your other senses, enhancing them.																						
35	35		301									It starts with your sense of smell. You peel away the layers of salinity and fishiness, dissecting them into individual strands.																						
36	36		301									They are the lawn, freshly mowed; your laundry, dried in the sun; a feast, and a bottle of beautiful wine; a fantasy, within which you can hide forever.																						
37	37		301									Next up is your sense of hearing. The calm waves play an everlasting, soothing melody.																						
38	38		301									The water whispers softly, like an entrustment from the past, or a call to the future.																						
39	39		301									It sounds like it is within your grasp while being miles away. Distance becomes ambiguous as your breath melts into the wind, flying off to the edge of the sky—																						
40	40		301									Your sense of touch pulls you back. The boat is too small for Nanami and you to sit next to each other, so you face opposite directions, sitting with your backs adhering together.																						
41	41		301									Instead of the warmth of her back, you can feel her hair most clearly.																						
42	42		301									Each strand of hair feels like the softest silk. It pierces your skin and your flesh, wrapping itself around your spine, sending you a slight tingle—																						
43	43		302						500		(Lean forward)	44																						
44	44		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You shake your head, focusing back on the fishing bobber, only to feel a light, sudden impact behind you—																						
45	45		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You were boastful with your claims to the commandant, but staying focused has proven to be more difficult than you imagined.																						
46	46		301									It might be easier if you were building something. Staring at a floating buoy is really trying your patience.																						
47	47		301									Restlessness creeps in quicker than normal. The urge to skip forward feels more alluring now.																						
48	48		301									You recall the commandant's words—																						
49	49		301									"It's not quantity that makes our memories valuable."																						
50	50		301									You want to create memories, but you are not seeking cold, impassive data to store in your hard drives.																						
51	51		301									You want to brand your companion into your consciousness. You want the commandant to "live" in your heart.																						
52	52		301									You suppress the sense of restlessness.																						
53	53		301									The ocean breeze tastes monotonously salty. You dislike that.																						
54	54		301									The waves sound dreary and bland. You would rather listen to the thrilling, changing tides if possible.																						
55	55		301									But the touch on your back—																						
56	56		301									Muscles more tender than artificial skin softly lean on your back. You can sense the commandant's ease.																						
57	57		301									You can feel the commandant's spine past your hair and clothes, unyielding and unbendable.																						
58	58		301									With Maple's great computational power, you can simulate the commandant's body temperature accurately.																						
59	59		301									Unlike you, a human body does not shift its temperature based on the power output.																						
60	60		301									It always stays within a certain range. Right now, your sensor indicates that it is 36.567℃.																						
61	61		301									It makes you feel warm, even when it is drastically lower than how heated your frame gets during battles.																						
62	62		201							1	500091	1																						
63	63		301							1		And so you relax, leaning more comfortably against the commandant's back...																						
64	64		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The commandant suddenly shifts forward slightly. Unprepared, you fall backward to the unexpected movement.																						
65	65		202							1					1

67	67		302			AniZhuanchangEnd					Nanami?	68																						
68	68		201							1	500091																							
69	69		301			DialogEnable				1	Nanami	Argh! Commandant!	1																					
70	70		301									Nanami seems startled, sitting straight abruptly.																						
71	71		302								Did you fall asleep?	72																						
72	72		204							1	8																							
73	73		301								Nanami	Um...	1																					
74	74		302								Fishing really tests our patience, doesn't it?	75																						
75	75		301									Recalling how distracted you also got, you figure you were no better than Nanami.																						
76	76		301								Nanami	That's not the reason why...	1																					
77	77		302								What?	78																						
78	78		204							1	1																							
79	79		301								Nanami	Nothing!	1																					
80	80		301								Nanami	The sun is about to set. Have you caught anything, Commandant?	1																					
81	81		302								Nothing at all...	82																						
82	82		204							1	8																							
83	83		301								Nanami	Neither has Nanami! Are we going to draw?	1																					
84	84		302								There is still time. Let's keep at it.																							
85	85		204							1	1																							
86	86		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Nanami	Alright! I don't always go fishing, but when I do, I won't leave empty-handed!	1																					
87	87		204						500	1	8																							
88	88		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory548.jpg																								
89	89		401							1	205																							
90	90		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Nanami	We're leaving empty-handed...	1																					
91	91		301									As beautiful as it is, a wish is but a wish. Reality sinks in as your hard work this afternoon has not been rewarded.																						
92	92		301									Nanami and your buckets are still empty, save for the water reflecting the bright, full moon above you.																						
93	93		302								What are we doing next?	94																						
94	94		301									You figure this is the end of this particular experience.																						
95	95		301								Nanami	Hmm...	1																					
96	96		301									Nanami closes her eyes, her brows furrowed, seemingly deep in thought.																						
97	97		301									Then she throws away her fishing rod before leaning on your back and placing her head on your shoulder, yawning and stretching.																						
98	98		204							1	1																							
99	99		301								Nanami	Never mind! This is it!	1																					
100	100		302								This is it?	101																						
101	101		301								Nanami	That's right! Nanami is content!	1																					
102	102		301								Nanami	My only regret is that we couldn't catch anything.	1																					
103	103		301									As if hearing Nanami's wish, the fishing bobber moves for the first time.																						
104	104		301								Nanami	Oh? Commandant, you've landed a fish!	1																					
105	105		302								(Reel it in)	106																						
106	106		202							1					1																			
107	107		301									The process is surprisingly easy, making you wonder if anything has actually taken the bait.																						
108	108		301									Even if something is hooked, it is probably just a tiny fish.																						
109	109		301									But you quickly realize you have utterly misjudged the situation.																						
110	110		301									A small "island" has parted the waters and emerged.																						
111	111		301									It was easy not because the fish was not hooked but because it was surfacing voluntarily.																						
112	112		201							1	500443																							
113	113		301			RImgBg1Shake				1	Whale	Arrrooo...	1																					
114	114		301									You have caught a whale!																						
115	115		201							1	500091	1																						
116	116		301							1	Nanami	Ah! Nanami just remembers that all the fish released in these waters are as enormous as this one!	1																					
117	117		302								Who can catch a fish like that?!	118																						
118	118		301									Perhaps a Construct does have the strength to reel in a whale? Was that why she was so confident when she suggested this competition?																						
119	119		201							1	500443																							
120	120		301							1	Whale	Arrrooo...	1																					
121	121		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					The whale easily flips over your boat. Unable to grasp the mast in time, you are thrown into the ocean with Nanami.
