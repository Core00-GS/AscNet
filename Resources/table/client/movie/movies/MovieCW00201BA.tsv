6	6		301									Nightfall drapes over the snowy forest in a thin veil of endless darkness.																						
7	7		301									She clenches her spear tightly in the blistering cold as she looks out at the dim red lights illuminating the forest like fireflies.																						
8	8		301									Lift. Aim. Throw. Her many battles had honed this skill into one powerful, fluid motion.																						
9	9		301									With each throw of her spear, the dim red lights drastically reduce in number.																						
10	10		301									However, many more still remain. The mechanoid creatures cloaked in darkness rush out of the forest and charge the humanoid hybrid girl standing in the middle of the snowfield.																						
11	11		301									Aside from the frigid wind, she is only accompanied by rows of spears standing at the ready.																						
12	12		301									She lifts up a spear from the snow, raises her front legs, then stomps on the ground with a heavy thud. The force from the impact sends a wave of snow billowing forward as it falls down.																						
13	13		301									Snow plasters her frame in the harsh wind, giving her armor a lustrous silver sheen.																						
14	14		301									The mechanoid creatures lay scattered on the ground, mottling the snowfield with their ink-black remains.																						
15	15		301									Before her, the rampaging mechanoids roar as if to devour all in their path.																						
16	16		301									Behind her, the faint flame of humanity glitters as smoke rises from the camp.																						
17	17		301									Following the lamenting cry of the last mechanoid, she plunges her spear back into the ground.																						
18	18		301									Rosetta and her spear have become an insurmountable gorge for the enemy.																						
19	19		301									Over what felt like countless years, this has been the day-to-day routine for the Forest Guard here in the snowfield—a battlefield for Rosetta to wander alone.																						
20	20		301									Under the night sky, Rosetta returns her gaze ahead once more.

27	27		301									The reconstruction of the port is carried out in an orderly manner with all hands on deck. Naturally, the Forest Guard joins in the reconstruction efforts.																						
28	28		301									Working in teams, they vigorously transport building materials around the port on their backs in loads far beyond humanly possible.																						
29	29		301									A humanoid Construct is seen walking among the Forest Guard, which seems peculiar to outsiders.

63	63		301								Rosetta	What happened?	1																					
64	64		301								Forest Guard A	We found Corrupted tracks nearby when we returned to camp. Our comrades have split up and are hunting them down.	2

74	74		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryLouDianNew.prefab		1
