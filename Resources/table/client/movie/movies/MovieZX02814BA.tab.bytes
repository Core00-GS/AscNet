3	3		301			DialogEnable						President Hassen announced a 30-minute break from the World Government's executive meeting due to the unexpected message from Karenina. Liszt must find enough reason to support his proposal during this time.																						
4	4		301									Liszt puts down the very brief incident report sent along with Karenina's message. It only mentions a Punishing Virus leak accident of unknown reason in the lunar base, which caused the zero-point engine to go haywire.

10	10		301							1	Norman	Hey, didn't you hear that girl from the Engineering Force...? Everyone on the Moon will die if they don't destroy that whatever engine!	2																					
11	11		301								Liszt	It's only one possibility... Besides, we can't know if that Engineering Force captain was telling the truth.	1																					
12	12		301									Liszt crosses his hands as if he is thinking of something.																						
13	13		301								Liszt	Karenina had a lot of contact with Collins on the Moon. He seemed to like her too... She even had private conversations with that agent. Who can guarantee she isn't acting like this because Collins was just stripped of his power...?	1																					
14	14		301								Liszt	A Punishing Virus outbreak just when we submitted the proposal... Is it really a coincidence?	1																					
15	15		301									Norman knows very well that Liszt's words were provoking, but he still has a point.																						
16	16		301								Liszt	Besides, there has never been any sign of the Punishing Virus on the lunar base over the years. When the zero-point reactor was activated, no virus was detected either... Not to mention all the checks were conducted by Karenina herself.	1																					
17	17		301								Norman	There was a serious incident on the Moon before I was born... It was suspected to be caused by the Punishing Virus. Perhaps...	2																					
18	18		301								Liszt	That was nothing more than a speculation. The only survivor, Dr. Kalon, was out of his mind... No evidence could link it to a possible leak of the Punishing Virus. Very few people knew the truth anyway.	1																					
19	19		301									Given Collins' more senior position, he might know the truth. But it does not matter anymore, for Liszt has zero interest in what happened in the past.																						
20	20		301								Norman	But my sister is still on the Moon. We can't afford to take the risk...	2																					
21	21		204							1	4																							
22	22		301								Liszt	Don't get it wrong...	1																					
23	23		301									Liszt's low, serious voice interrupts Norman.																						
24	24		301								Liszt	She's no longer your sister. You have only one sister now, which is Victoria. Don't forget that you are representing your family. Think twice before you speak.	1																					
25	25		301									Liszt gets on his feet and walks to the door.																						
26	26		301								Liszt	Just stay here if you can't watch the Parliament make their decision. I'll take care of everything... myself.	1

37	37		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The break is over. All the participants have returned to the parliament hall. Almost everyone is discussing Karenina's recording and report, each with their own intentions.																						
38	38		402							212																								
39	39		401							1	202																							
40	40		301									Hassen looks around and goes back to his position as the host. He clears his throat, and the hall gets quiet over time. But it does not mean the argument is over‚Äîthe real battle is only about to begin.																						
41	41		201							1	500011																							
42	42		301							1	Hassen	Based on the meeting protocols, I hereby announce that the World Government executive meeting is changed to an emergency meeting to discuss how we should respond to the sudden crisis on the Moon.	1																					
43	43		301								Hassen	First of all, I'm quite certain that Councilman Liszt would like to explain, right?	1																					
44	44		301									Hassen nods at Liszt, giving him the podium.																						
45	45		201							1	500496																							
46	46		301							1	Liszt	The report was sent by Karenina, the Engineering Force captain. Neither she nor we have any clue how the Punishing Virus was produced or how it caused the zero-point engine to go haywire.	1																					
47	47		301								Liszt	The comms are completely cut, so we are unable to get further information from her. I don't think we have sufficient information to make a rational decision.	1																					
48	48		301									Liszt's words remain unbiased, but he has a clear objective‚Äîto calm everyone down first. He trusts they are rational enough to understand what Babylonia's best option is.																						
49	49		301								Liszt	But there is one thing I would like to urge each and every one of you to carefully consider before making any decision. The zero-point reactor was made by our best scientists after numerous sacrifices. It is the dream machine that will guide humanity toward the future of hope.	1																					
50	50		204							1	4																							
51	51		301								Liszt	Right now, we have an opportunity to reach that future. Are we really going to destroy it with our own hands?	1																					
52	52		301								Liszt	Are we going to neglect all the sacrifices humanity had made in the past?	1																					
53	53		301								Liszt	Are we stripping all humans of their rights to reach their hope in the future?	1																					
54	54		301									Liszt's question forces all the council members to put humanity as a whole on the scale. Even those who insisted to destroy the engine earlier have begun to hesitate.																						
55	55		301								Liszt	That is why I am firmly against the destruction of the zero-point engine. I hope this can become the foundation of all subsequent discussions...	1																					
56	56		204							1	5																							
57	57		301									He has been secretly paying attention to Hassen and Nikola but does not see anything unusual. He thought those hawks would be in favor of the destruction of the zero-point engine.																						
58	58		301									Perhaps even they have to admit that the benefits of the zero-point engine outweigh the cost. He has won.																						
59	59		202							1					1																			
60	60		301								???	Excuse me. Sorry, I'm late‚Äîactually, "we" are late.																						
61	61		201							1	500319																							
62	62		301							1		An elderly but still vigorous man calmly walks into the hall, followed by two young individuals.																						
63	63		201							1	500496	4																						
64	64		301							1	Liszt	(Collins... I knew he wouldn't give up easily.)	1																					
65	65		301									Liszt saw Collins coming and prepared for it. He gives a signal to his subordinate in the Control Court.																						
66	66		201							1	500340																							
67	67		301							1	Control Court Member	Mr. Collins... If I recall correctly, you are currently under internal investigation for the unlawful imprisonment of the Gray Raven Commandant. You are not qualified to take part in World Government meetings. President Hassen, I suggest we...	1																					
68	68		301									Before the meeting started, Collins was told that he would be put under internal investigation for the inappropriate "imprisonment" of the Gray Raven Commandant.																						
69	69		301									He was certain that he did not leave any evidence for Babylonia. Even if they were after him, they didn't have to wait until now. The only possible explanation was Liszt had been planning this all along to set him up.																						
70	70		201							1	500319																							
71	71		301							1	Collins	Excuse me, you probably got it wrong. I have no intention to become part of the meeting. These two young people have never been here, so I was just showing them the way.	1																					
72	72		301									Liszt finally shifts his attention to the two behind Collins. One of them is Simon, the commandant of Dark Aries, while the other is... the Gray Raven Commandant?!																						
73	73		301								Collins	I know I'm currently forbidden to sit in a World Government meeting, and I have never been in one in the past anyway. Still, as the Chief Military Advisor, I think I still have the right to refer someone.	1																					
74	74		301									Collins gives Hassen a meaningful look until Hassen nods.																						
75	75		201							1	500011																							
76	76		301							1	Hassen	Of course. I trust it is in our common interest to see more trusted young people being referred to this meeting.	1																					
77	77		201							1	500319																							
78	78		301							1	Collins	(Damn old fox...)	1																					
79	79		301									Collins smiles. He knows that Hassen and others would strongly oppose him should he have referred anyone else today.																						
80	80		301									He has been keeping the referral as a trump card, but he has no other option now and can only bet everything on the Gray Raven Commandant.																						
81	81		301								Collins	I'd like to invite them here because they have been through numerous battles on the frontline. They are the experts in making such decisions.	1																					
82	82		301								Collins	In particular, the Gray Raven Commandant is our "hero" who has participated in various difficult missions. I'm sure the opinion of this commandant means a lot to everybody.	1																					
83	83		301								Collins	There was a little misunderstanding between the Gray Raven Commandant and me, but we still developed a great friendship during our conversation...	1																					
84	84		302								...	85																						
85	85		301								Collins	Oops, I'm talking too much. Well, it's time for me to go. I'll leave it to you.	1																					
86	86		301									Collins leaves his final words before walking out of the meeting hall.																						
87	87		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Collins	Don't let me down... Gray Raven Commandant.	1																					
88	88		201							1	500201																							
89	89		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Simon	Um, Chief... I've never been in a meeting like this...	1																					
90	90		302								Me neither...	91																						
91	91		204							1	10																							
92	92		301								Simon	I feel like I'm going to throw up...	1																					
93	93		301									You are not used to being the center of attention either, whether it comes from the Corrupted... or from the questioning eyes of the humans that are supposed to be on your side.																						
94	94		302								Just think of them all as Corrupted.	95																						
95	95		301								Simon	Then I'm going to pass out...	1																					
96	96		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Simon finally forces a smile... Thanks to that Kurono man, the two of you are standing on this unfamiliar battlefield instead of fighting the Punishing Virus.

101	101		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Hours ago, that Collins guy rushed into the treatment room of the Star of Life. Nobody dared to stand in his way except Dr. Hippocrates.																						
102	102		301									It's the Kurono officer that Nikola warned you about‚Äîgiven his behavior, it is near impossible to not recognize him.																						
103	103		201							1	500319																							
104	104		301							1	Collins	You're the Gray Raven Commandant, aren't you?	1																					
105	105		201							1	500404	5																						
106	106		301							1	Hippocrates	They are all my patients... And who are you? One more step, I'll crush your frontal lobe.	1																					
107	107		302								It's okay, Doctor. We'd like to have some time with him.	108																						
108	108		204							1																								
109	109		301								Hippocrates	Fine... You have 15 minutes. I'm not taking responsibility if you get worse.	1																					
110	110		202							1																								
111	111		301									After she left, Collins explains the situation in the Parliament and Karenina's work on the Moon. You don't know how much you can trust him, but the information about Karenina and Luna sounds quite credible.																						
112	112		302								What will happen if we don't destroy the zero-point engine?	113																						
113	113		201							1	500319																							
114	114		301							1	Collins	According to Karenina's report, not only everyone in the lunar base will die, the gravitational waves will also send rocks flying toward the Earth... Then it won't be a matter of single or double-figure casualties.	1																					
115	115		301								Collins	If everything goes according to Liszt's plan, nobody will speak for Karenina. Even if she can destroy the engine and return, they will probably pin some charges on her.	1																					
116	116		301									After all, destroying the zero-point engine without permission is a serious crime. If Liszt decides to make a big deal of it, Karenina will not get away.																						
117	117		301									The worst part is that it will hurt the military's trust in the Parliament and may even stir up conflicts between them.																						
118	118		201							1	500201																							
119	119		301							1	Simon	I've been paying attention to the meeting. Just like Mr. Collins said... most of the voices were supportive of Liszt's proposal.	1																					
120	120		301									That's why Simon asked if I knew a Construct named "Karenina". He was already aware of what happened.																						
121	121		201							1	500319																							
122	122		301							1	Collins	How ironic... The "hero" they raised to guard against me is now the only power I can rely on.	1																					
123	123		302								Sorry, but I have no reason to help Kurono.	124																						
124	124		301									To your surprise, Collins does not seem to be worried at all but smiles instead, as if he knew you would be giving this answer.																						
125	125		301								Collins	You won't turn me down... Just like Karenina, you cannot sit and watch if other people are in danger. If the Parliament is a battlefield, only you can save them in this war.	1																					
126	126		302								What's there for you to save Karenina and other innocent people?	127																						
127	127		301									Obviously, this man would never do anything without benefit. Even when he is driven to the edge, you must find out his exact purpose to avoid any potential repercussions.																						
128	128		301								Collins	Hah, how cautious of you. In fact, I couldn't care less about Karenina and others on the Moon. She means nothing to me after completing that huge Omega Weapon...	1																					
129	129		301								Collins	But just like I said earlier, I firmly believe that agent named Luna is the key to humanity's future evolution. We must not let her die in vain on that deserted Moon.	1																					
130	130		302								Is that a theory you believe in?	131																						
131	131		301								Collins	No. In fact, it's my instinct... When you get older, you learn that simple instinct often makes more sense than complicated calculations.	1																					
132	132		301								Collins	I trust it is a necessary sacrifice for the greater good. Not only Karenina, I would not hesitate to sacrifice my entire life just to find that answer.	1																					
133	133		301								Collins	But you're different. You are a lot greedier than I am... No matter how dire the situation is, the first thing on your mind is always to save everyone and everything.	1																					
134	134		301								Collins	Honestly, I thought it would be only a matter of time before your kindness got you killed. But you proved me wrong every single time, dammit...	1																					
135	135		302								Is that so? I'm sorry.	136																						
136	136		301									Collins stands up next to the bed and reaches out his hand.																						
137	137		301								Collins	Just like what I told Karenina on the Moon, Ascendants aren't necessarily always the enemies of humanity. Neither is Kurono... Only frailty is.	1																					
138	138		301								Collins	If you and I are both too weak, why don't we join forces at least for now?	1																					
139	139		301									Utilizing all available resources is a basic principle of tactics. Even enemies can and must be used if necessary.																						
140	140		302								(Hold out your hand)	141																						
141	141		301									Collins laughs boldly, shaking your hand and ignoring your vigilance.

149	149		301									The wounds are hurting so much that you must lean on Simon to stand still. But the pain gives your mind clarity.																						
150	150		301								Hassen	In that case, we shall let the Gray Raven Commandant speak first. Is that okay with you, Councilman Liszt?	1																					
151	151		301									With a frown, Liszt eventually nods... But he obviously is not giving up.																						
152	152		201							1	500496

165	165		301									You quickly signal Simon not to help as it will only expose your frailty... But it seems too late. The wolf already has his eyes on the prey.																						
166	166		201							1	500496	5																						
167	167		301							1	Liszt	Don't push yourself too hard, Gray Raven Commandant... This might not be a battlefield, but that's no reason for you to overexert yourself.	1																					
168	168		301									He has seen through your camouflage and is determined to completely crush your confidence. The two commandants may have been through a lot of battles, but on this battlefield, you are not much different from rookies.																						
169	169		301									Some council members are already getting impatient. To them, letting an inexperienced commandant speak is a pure waste of their time.																						
170	170		301									Liszt has always had the upper hand. No matter what you do, you can't seem to easily shake his argument.																						
171	171		301									But that can also become your advantage. The enemy will only expose some weakness when they think they have already won.																						
172	172		302								Thanks, Councilman Liszt... But aren't you the one who is overexerting yourself?	173																						
173	173		301								Liszt	Me...? Sorry, but I don't quite understand.	1																					
174	174		301									You need to remind everyone of the one thing that Liszt has been avoiding...																						
175	175		302								(The security of Babylonia)	176	(The safety of zero-point energy)	177	(The security of the lunar base)	176																		
176	176	175	301									(No... Liszt isn't concerned about that. Think again)																						
177	177		301									As an outsider with almost no preparation or foundation, you need to attack the opponent's weak point first. Even if it can't take him down, you can still drag him into a skirmish.																						
178	178		301									"The data obtained from Atlantis successfully helped the lunar base to reboot the zero-point engine. However, are you able to guarantee it is safe to use?"																						
179	179		301									"Who can guarantee that incidents like this will not happen again when we are actually sailing in the vast universe? Without the Earth to back us up, we have no means to deal with it."																						
180	180		301								Liszt	Your worry is unnecessary. The restart of the zero-point reactor has been verified both theoretically and physically. No Punishing Virus was detected in the vacuum chamber throughout its booting and running.	1																					
181	181		301									"So Karenina must have confirmed the results. You mentioned earlier that she was the expert in zero-point energy research, which gave the project a lot of credentials."																						
182	182		301								Liszt	Of course, all the data collected in the experiments is still valid. My proposal is based on this evidence.	1																					
183	183		301									"Then why are we not trusting the decision she made on the spot?"																						
184	184		301									"While we are here talking, they are fighting death and disaster, over and over!"																						
185	185		301									Liszt's deep eyes stare at you. He seems to be thinking about how to spin the argument back on his side.																						
186	186		301								Liszt	In her report, Karenina also stated that she could not guarantee the destruction of the zero-point engine would definitely stop the disaster. It might even cause more dire consequences...	1																					
187	187		301								Liszt	If both options have their risks and I have to pick one, I would prioritize the zero-point engine.	1																					
188	188		301									"Even at the cost of the lives of those on the Moon, and more innocent people on the ground?"																						
189	189		301								Liszt	It's a "necessary sacrifice"... To me, all the sacrifices are worthy of our one and only hope. We can't be naive and think we can survive this world without any sacrifices.	1																					
190	190		301								Liszt	As the Gray Raven Commandant, you know this more than anybody else... That new specialized frame was used by one of your Constructs. Her name is Liv, I believe.	1																					
191	191		301									Liszt clenches his fist as he speaks to all the council members in a calm and firm tone, increasing his credibility even further.																						
192	192		301								Liszt	She knew someone must make the sacrifice. Someone must become hope... Without the sacrifice, humanity may never have their future... Right now, the zero-point engine is the only hope!	1																					
193	193		301									Sacrifices must be made for our only glimmer of hope... No one has ever doubted this axiom, but what truly is hope?
