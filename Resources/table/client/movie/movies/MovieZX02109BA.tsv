5	5		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The two of you exit the building and return outside.																						
6	6		301									You can see lightning in the distant sky.																						
7	7		301									The thundercloud to your east has indeed roamed toward the city. The rain has yet to arrive, but the sound of thunder has.																						
8	8		301									A thunderstorm will soon envelop the city. The sound of waves is getting nearer.																						
9	9		301									The city has submerged considerably.																						
10	10		301									Looking out on a street in the main city, you no longer see the landing pad. Only the top of a few satellite cities remains above water.																						
11	11		201							1	500345																							
12	12		301							1	Vera	The city is still sinking. I have no idea if their safeguard for the submergence threshold is still working or not. If it doesn't stop going down, the water pressure will destroy it all.	1																					
13	13		301								Vera	We've got two options: either we find a way to stop the city from submerging, or we head for the reactor directly, hoping we'll find some key intel before it all goes poof.	1																					
14	14		301								Vera	Whichever we choose, we won't be able to find out... where they are. We don't have time to search all of these buildings one by one.	1																					
15	15		302								These Corrupted are kind of strange.	16																						
16	16		202							1					1																			
17	17		301									Vera nods.																						
18	18		301									There are clearly two kinds of Corrupted here.																						
19	19		301									One of them is the Cleaner Bots that were serving this base. The emblems on these mechanoids are obvious.																						
20	20		301									The other one... You cannot tell where they come from.																						
21	21		201							1	500345																							
22	22		301							1	Vera	They're probably Corrupted that infested the nearby ocean recently. They were the ones who brought the Punishing Virus here.	1																					
23	23		302								Their level of infection is different.	24	Their level of abrasion is different.	24																				
24	24		301									Vera takes a look at the Corrupted remains scattered on the ground.																						
25	25		301								Vera	The machines from the base are only faintly infected. The abrasion from seawater is barely noticeable.	1																					
26	26		301									They have not been infected for long, thus their desire to attack humans is more restrained.																						
27	27		204							1	13																							
28	28		301								Vera	Hah, what an unfortunate end to a paradise. Having been isolated from the Punishing Virus-infected world for so many years, it is still going to fall.	1																					
29	29		302								It's a shame.	30																						
30	30		204							1																								
31	31		301								Vera	Did you think I was feeling sorry for it?	1																					
32	32		301								Vera	Don't be mistaken. I don't give a shit about this placeâ€”I don't care if it's destroyed or not. All I want to know is where the hell this zero-point reactor is. Do we need to search every single room here?	1																					
33	33		301								Vera	God dammit. If the humans are all gone, why are these electromagnetic barriers still working?	1																					
34	34		302								We can ask those mechanoids.	35																						
35	35		301									Vera glances at the Cleaner Bot lying on the floor.																						
36	36		301								Vera	You want to ask these metal junks?	1																					
37	37		302								They're only faintly infected.	38																						
38	38		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					That means we might still be able to communicate with their logic circuits.																						
39	39		202							1					1																			
40	40		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After a while.																						
41	41		201							1	500345																							
42	42		301							1	Vera	You're quite familiar with this sort of stuff. I suppose Lee has kept you trained?	1																					
43	43		301								Vera	How is it? Has our metal junk here shared any feelings with you, Chief?	1																					
44	44		302								(Transfer Vera the deciphered data)	45																						
45	45		301									All Cleaner Bots in the base are on the same local network. You have identified their patrol routes.																						
46	46		301									Vera quickly responds after reading the data.																						
47	47		301									Their patrol routes form a three-dimensional "nest," each "branch" a corridor or a pipeline.																						
48	48		301								Vera	I see... What is that in the center of the nest? Why do all of the Cleaner Bots walk around it? They didn't even upload the plan of that place onto the Bots' systems.	1																					
49	49		302								It must require higher clearance.	50																						
50	50		301									High enough that those humans did not allow this level of mechanoids in.																						
51	51		301								Vera	The zero-point reactor.	1																					
52	52		302								(Nod)	53																						
53	53		301								Vera	Good. Then should we head up or down now?	1																					
54	54		302								Down.	55																						
55	55		301								Vera	Of course.	1																					
56	56		302								We're out of time.	57																						
57	57		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Vera	You don't have to remind me. But right now... we need to breach these barriers.	1
