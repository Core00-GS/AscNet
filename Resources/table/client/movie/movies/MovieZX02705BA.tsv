4	4		301									All of her mobility and feedback units are offline, and the only thing that is still running is her linear neural circuit. Unlike a human's dream, a machine can still stay "awake" in this state.																						
5	5		301									Why did she save the girl? Only now, as her processor cannot support elaborate data analysis and logical calculations, does she begin to ponder this question.																						
6	6		301									"Saving humans" is not part of Haicma's underlying protocols, and the only person who can command Haicma is now buried underneath the ruins of the research laboratory.
