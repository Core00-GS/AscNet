14	14		301									The hetero-crystals Lamia controls jet from the nearby cliffside, hitting where you were standing. Lee repositions you to ensure everyone is safe before firing three times at the distorted space next to him.	1

16	16		301			PanelActor1Shake				1	Lamia	Aargh!	1																					
17	17		301									Lamia appears on a ridge near Lee with a scorched right hand. She grinds her teeth as she stares at Lee, looking embarrassed and angry for the first time.

19	19		301							1	Lee	This is what you're after, isn't it?	1																					
20	20		301									A gleaming white cube appears on Lee's fingertips—Huaxu's key, given by Roland earlier.																						
21	21		301									He hands Lucia the key before pointing his gun at Lamia.	1

25	25		301								Lee	Can't let an Ascendant get ahold of it again.	1																					
26	26		301								Lamia	...Ascendant? Pfft, you really are pretty clueless, aren't you?	2																					
27	27		301								Lee	What are you saying?	1																					
28	28		301								Lamia	Hmm... I'll get nagged if I say another word. You're nowhere nearly as scary as that guy.	2																					
29	29		301								Lamia	Try as you may, I'll get what I want eventually. And this time... you're not catching me.	2

33	33		301									The bridge Lamia made instantly crumbles, the crystals that supported it falling down the crevice into the Red Tide. Only then do you realize you have been led to the Polyphage's side of the platform during the battle.	2

36	36		301							1	Lee	...There goes our way back. I'm sorry for letting her get away.	1																					
37	37		302								It's not your fault.	38																						
38	38		301								Liv	It isn't... Sadly, we no longer can track her whereabouts.	2

44	44		301							1	Lee	...You're right. At least we've reached the entrance to the Polyphage. Nothing can stop us now.	1																					
45	45		301								Lee	There's still one thing that baffles me, though...	1																					
46	46		302								What do you mean?	47																						
47	47		301								Lee	Lamia's familiarity with the Spear of F.O.S. is beyond reasonable. Even as an act, she still wouldn't be able to be that familiar with a battle system Babylonia's using for the first time.	1																					
48	48		301								Liv	Maybe she was informed by Huaxu, like how Alpha did?	2																					
49	49		301								Lee	...Possible. But I still think something is off.	1																					
50	50		301								Lee	Forget it. It's pointless to worry about it now. Let's keep going.	1

56	56		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Lamia	Sigh... What a failure, Lamia! Maybe if I follow them from behind, I'll find another way to snatch Huaxu from them.	1																					
57	57		301								???	You talked too much.																						
58	58		204							1	1																							
59	59		301								Lamia	...I know, I know. But you have to know how funny it was—isn't that guy your brother? Why don't you just ask him if you want Huaxu for yourself?	1																					
60	60		301								Lamia	Or am I sensing another agenda here? Hehe... You humans even lie to your own family. Spooky!	1																					
61	61		301								???	...It's not your place to judge. Go, complete your task.																						
62	62		301								Lamia	But I'll have to get sooo close to the Polyphage this way... Sigh...	1																					
63	63		301								Lamia	If I'm doing something so ridiculously risky for you, you can't be going back on what you promised me, you hear me?	1																					
64	64		301								???	I'll keep my end of the bargain if you keep yours.																						
65	65		301								Lamia	Good. It was a lot of work playing prisoner while trying to keep the Punishing Virus at an acceptable level to the Gray Ravens...	1																					
66	66		301								???	Is that so? You seemed like you were enjoying yourself.
