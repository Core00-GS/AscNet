10	10		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Shrek	If we ever lose hope one day, will you jump into the Red Tide?	2																					
11	11		301								Bella	I'll never lose hope. I will spread my hope to everyone else.	1																					
12	12		301								Shrek	There won't be any fewer desperate people even if you write those chicken soup words all over the planet.	2																					
13	13		301									Shrek points at the barrier wall downstairs. Bella already wrote her favorite mottos on it with some homemade paint.																						
14	14		301								Shrek	Let me rephrase the question. If the Red Tide really is heaven, will you jump in?	2																					
15	15		301								Bella	Nope. Even if that gross mud flow is heaven, those who jump in are no more than biscuits covered in mud.	1																					
16	16		301									She sneezes a few times then wraps the blanket more tightly around herself.																						
17	17		301								Bella	Even though I know there are biscuits in that mud, I'll never drink it.	1																					
18	18		301								Shrek	Yeah, there's enough chicken soup for you anyway.	2																					
19	19		301									Bella makes a contemptuous grunt.																						
20	20		301								Shrek	Have you heard of Population Effect?	2																					
21	21		301								Bella	Yep, but you might be thinking about Bandwagon Effect.	1																					
22	22		301								Shrek	Oh, you're right.	2																					
23	23		301									Sitting on the rooftop, the two silently watch the Red Tide slithering a few blocks away.																						
24	24		301								Bella	When should we go down? It's getting cold.	1																					
25	25		301								Shrek	Only the rooftop matches my swag as a Cardman Rider.	2																					
26	26		301								Bella	That's enough.	1																					
27	27		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Bella picks up her blanket and stands up. Shrek quickly follows her.

29	30		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Shrek	Say, do you think they all jump on this Red Tide bandwagon so quickly because of... Bandwagon Effect?	2																					
30	31		301								Bella	I'm not a psychologist. Don't ask me.	1																					
31	32		301								Shrek	But...	2																					
32	33		301									Shrek glances at the book in Bella's hand.																						
33	34		301								Bella	It's just a placebo.	1																					
34	35		301								Shrek	So you knew!	2																					
35	36		301								Bella	But these words are really helpful for me. At least better than that manga stuff that you read.	1																					
36	37		301									Shrek is about to fight back when Bella covers his mouth with her palm.																						
37	38		301								Bella	Alright, alright. Although supplies around here are scarce and hard to find, we've still gathered enough over the last few days.	1																					
38	39		301								Bella	It's getting very late now. Let's wait until the morning to move out.	1																					
39	40		301									Shrek sighs at that statement.																						
40	41		301								Bella	What is it?	1																					
41	42		301								Shrek	...I was hoping to pick up more books here. You know what, the book you tore is Cardman Rider: Legend of Time. Have you any idea how rare it is?!	2																					
42	43		301								Bella	You had to use those creepy names on me!	1																					
43	44		301									Bella pulls up the musty blanket and turns her back toward Shrek.																						
44	45		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Bella	Get some sleep. We're leaving early tomorrow.	1
