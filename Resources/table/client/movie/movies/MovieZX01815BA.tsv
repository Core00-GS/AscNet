14	13		301								Kamui	Huh? What are drones doing at that high of an altitude?	2

96	96		301							1	Chrome	Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. President.	1																					
97	97		301								Chrome	I was dispatched on a low-risk mission to patrol and survey the Arctic Ocean. Combined with the local climate, it would be more reasonable to assign it to Arctic Fox, since they are better equipped for cold environments.	1																					
98	98		301								Chrome	This top-secret mission surely plays important tactical significance to Babylonia. However, the spec ops members appear to have encountered an issue that has resulted in the necessity for a stealth evac.	1																					
99	99		301								Chrome	I believe that is because the spec ops members have encountered an issue that is beyond their capabilities.	1																					
100	100		301								Chrome	The failure of this operation is bound to hinder the process of recapturing Earth. Therefore, I highly advise dispatching additional personnel to conduct a rescue mission and complete the mission with a larger team.	1																					
101	101		301								Chrome	I believe you two are also looking for candidates to form a rescue team.	1																					
102	102		201							1	500011		-400																					
103	103		201							2	500012		400																					
104	104		301							1	Nikola	Correct, except not to conduct a rescue mission. Rather, we need to ensure that Babylonia acquires the necessary intel.	2

106	106		201							1	500155																							
107	107		301							1	Chrome	Understood. I'm sure there are also certain criteria for selecting the personnel.	1																					
108	108		301								Chrome	Most of the task force members have been dispatched to various places around the world to eradicate the Corrupted.	1																					
109	109		301								Chrome	Kamui just so happens to have just completed his mission, and I am currently on standby in Babylonia. We can use the Chrome airdrop capsules to land on the surface at high speed whenever needed. So, I propose that we are the best candidates for this operation.	1																					
110	110		201							1	500011		-400																					
111	111		201							2	500012		400																					
112	112		301							1	Nikola	Impossible. This is a conflict of interest, and your personal biases will only doom the mission to failure.	2

117	117		301								Chrome	Whether in terms of execution ability or efficiency, Strike Hawk is the best choice.	1

129	129		301							1	Hassen	Well, it seems like you have already made up your mind.	1

132	132		201							1	500155																							
133	133		301							1	Chrome	Because there are a few issues there that only I can solve.	1																					
134	134		301								Chrome	If that is the case, then I will immediately resume the survey mission and rendezvous with Arctic Fox once I complete this mission.	1																					
135	135		201							1	500011		-400																					
136	136		201							2	500012		400																					
137	137		301							1	Hassen	I heard Asimov say that the modifications to your frame are still in the trial phase. Continuous high-intensity operations put a lot of strain on it.	1
