3	3		301									The dozen of tall Constructs stand out conspicuously in the crowd. Staessen picks you and the others out in a glance.

8	8		301							1	Diana	Apologies for my unauthorized departure, Captain Staessen, but 【kuroname】 and I brought Rosetta and her companions back.	1

11	11		301							1	Staessen	Apology accepted.	1																					
12	12		301								Staessen	And now... my turn for an apology for what I'm about to say.	1

17	17		201							1	500199																							
18	18		301							1	Staessen	To tell you the truth, I just had a private exchange with representatives from other settlements.	1																					
19	19		301								Staessen	We have agreed to absolve you of the "sinner" status, but only under certain conditions.	1

24	24		201							1	500098																							
25	25		301							1	Rosetta	So... I guess this hinges on the conditions?	1																					
26	26		202							1																								
27	27		201							1	500199																							
28	28		301							1	Staessen	Indeed.	1																					
29	29		202							1																								
30	30		201							1	500098																							
31	31		301							1	Rosetta	This works better for us as well. Knowing our reputation in the ARU, absolving us so lightly must've ruffled a few feathers.	1																					
32	32		202							1																								
33	33		201							1	500199																							
34	34		301							1	Staessen	...Indeed. I wanted to announce it publicly, but I was acting out of turn.	1																					
35	35		202							1																								
36	36		201							1	500098																							
37	37		301							1	Rosetta	So, what are the conditions?	1

40	40		301							1	Staessen	You must retrieve two "Moses class" icebreakers from the Border Commune.	1

49	49		301							1	Lucia	Retrieve?	1																					
50	50		202							1																								
51	51		201							1	500199																							
52	52		301							1	Staessen	If you can complete this mission, the icebreakers will be immediately put to work establishing a new settlement for the Forest Guards.	1																					
53	53		301								Staessen	In the new settlement, Forest Guards will be regarded as equal members of the ARU.	1																					
54	54		202							1																								
55	55		201							1	500098																							
56	56		301							1	Rosetta	Very well. This should be enough to win respect for the Forest Guards.	1																					
57	57		301								Rosetta	But before that, I think you need to explain to our guests here first.	1
