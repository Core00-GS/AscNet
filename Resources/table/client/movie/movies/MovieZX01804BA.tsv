3	3		301			DialogEnable						Time is fleeting like sand through an hourglass.																						
4	4		301									The sun hangs on the western horizon, shedding light across the lower half of the sky and turning to night upon reaching this far.																						
5	5		301									The dry air and radiational cooling have caused the surrounding temperature to drop rapidly. Scorching heat turns to frigid cold in an instant.																						
6	6		301									The entire camp is quiet beyond imagination. Except for the occasional clang of metal whenever the calibration team lays equipment, there is only the roar of the cold wind.																						
7	7		301									How do people here endure such an extreme cycle of day and night?																						
8	8		301									Huddled next to an abandoned cabin, you curl up under the tarp not to shield yourself from the sand, but to keep warm.																						
9	9		301									Who had lived in this cabin? Inside, some of the utensils still retained a faint luster. A thin layer of dust indicates that the owner had never returned.																						
10	10		301									After Chief Commander Hans had put the Gray Ravens on standby, they now watched from the sidelines as Constructs from Calibration Team 01 continued to configure coordinates.																						
11	11		301									Upon receiving the serum supply, the service personnel has also finished repairing the protective devices used to combat the Red Tide. Theoretically, this is the safest you have been since crash landing.																						
12	12		301									However, anxiety still lingers in your heart.																						
13	13		301									You cannot help but stand up and look to the east. Supposedly, the coastline is dozens of kilometers out—the area that Babylonia has to protect at all costs.																						
14	14		301									However, regardless of how hard you strain your eyes as a human, you are unable to behold such a sight.																						
15	15		201							1	500273																							
16	16		301							1	Wanshi	Don't bother. The terrain here isn't high enough to see the coastline.	1																					
17	17		301									You suddenly hear Wanshi's voice behind you. Everyone turns to look at him.																						
18	18		301									All you see is him stretch with a look of exhaustion as he walks over.																						
19	19		301								Wanshi	Not to mention, with such poor weather conditions and low visibility here...	1																					
20	20		301								Wanshi	Human eyesight can't possibly see that far.	1

30	30		201							1	500273																							
31	31		301							1	Wanshi	Well, my mission was to pick up the calibration team sent by Babylonia.	1																					
32	32		301								Wanshi	My work here is done. Can't a guy kick up his feet a while?	1																					
33	33		301								Wanshi	Sheesh... R&R ain't easy to come by.	1																					
34	34		301									Before Lee can muster up a retort, Wanshi looks your way.																						
35	35		301								Wanshi	Don'tcha think it's time to change the gauze on your commandant's forehead?	1																					
36	36		202							1					1																			
37	37		301									Right as Wanshi begins to speak, Liv had already begun making preparations.																						
38	38		301									Within no time, she had already begun replacing your bandages.																						
39	39		201							1	1031001																							
40	40		301							1	Liv	Thanks for the reminder, Wanshi.	1																					
41	41		302								It's not bleeding anymore, Liv.	42	No need to worry.	43																				
42	42	44	301								Liv	Even still, your bandages need to be replaced periodically to prevent infection.	1																					
43	43		301								Liv	No need to act tough, Commandant.	1																					
44	44		301									It is not until Liv changes your gauze does she realizes that a considerable amount of sand has adhered to your bloody scab.																						
45	45		301									Cleaning the wound is not exactly going to be a leisurely stroll through the park...																						
46	46		301									Your breath hisses in pain through clenched teeth.																						
47	47		301								Liv	Lucia.	1																					
48	48		201							1	500166																							
49	49		301							1	Lucia	Understood.	1																					
50	50		202							1					1																			
51	51		301									Lucia quickly tears open a pack of field rations and stuffs it into your mouth to bite on.																						
52	52		302								Arrrrrrrgh—!	53																						
53	53		301									Squinting your eyes in the dim light, you catch a glimpse of a thin figure poking their head out of a tent behind Liv.																						
54	54		302								(Gesture to Liv with your eyes)	55	(Beckon them)	57																				
55	55		201							1	1031001																							
56	56	59	301							1	Liv	No amount of stubbornness will stop me from cleaning your wound, Commandant.	1																					
57	57		201							1	1031001																							
58	58		301							1	Liv	Huh? What's wrong? Someone there?	1																					
59	59		301									Before Liv can react, the thin figure was already running over.																						
60	60		301									He scurries over next to Liv and gazes toward you with a doe-eyed look of curiosity.																						
61	61		301								Liv	Eyah—!	1																					
62	62		201							1	500273																							
63	63		301							1	Wanshi	Was that the kid from earlier?	1																					
64	64		202							1					1																			
65	65		301									The boy's gaze falls on you... Rather, the ration in your mouth.																						
66	66		302								(Tear off a piece and hand it to him)	67																						
67	67		301									Like a kitten, he sticks out his hand and hesitates until he cannot resist any longer. He grabs the ration and wolfs it down.																						
68	68		301									Lucia quickly takes out a second piece and hands it to him.																						
69	69		301									However, the boy does not immediately eat it after taking it this time.																						
70	70		201							1	500259																							
71	71		301							1	Refugee Child	Thank you, Miss.	1																					
72	72		202							1					1																			
73	73		401							2	1513																							
74	74		301									A woman hurries in before Lucia can respond.																						
75	75		301									She pulls the boy behind her, glances around at everyone cautiously, then looks down at the child by her thigh.																						
76	76		201							1	500259		450																					
77	77		201							2	500251		-450																					
78	78		301							1	Refugee Child	Granny...	1																					
79	79		301								Woman	Who said you could leave?!	2																					
80	80		301								Refugee Child	I'm starving...	1																					
81	81		301								Woman	Didn't you have a can for lunch?	2																					
82	82		301								Refugee Child	I'm just so hungry...	1																					
83	83		301								Woman	We'll have food soon. Your dad'll be back in no time.	2																					
84	84		301								Refugee Child	But people said he won't...	1																					
85	85		301									The woman snaps at the boy and interrupts him.																						
86	86		301								Woman	Shut your mouth! Don't dare say such a thing! Who said you could talk like that?! He'll be back soon, and I mean it!	2

89	89		301							1	Lucia	...	1																					
90	90		301								Lucia	Don't get mad at him, please. It was my idea to give it to him.	1																					
91	91		301								Lucia	We have plenty to go around if you want...	1

97	96		301									Saying that, she quickly takes the boy and leaves.																						
98	97		301								All	...																						
99	98		301								Old Man	Forgive her. She has her own troubles.	1																					
100	99		301									Turning your head to the side, you see the old man who had previously returned to his residence.																						
101	100		201							1	500166		-450																					
102	101		201							2	500294		450

104	103		301									Her words stop as she sees the can in his hands.																						
105	104		301								Old Man	Guess you won't be needing this. I just thought maybe...	2

108	602		203							2	0.25	600																						
109	107		301							1	Lee	We're Constructs. We don't need food in the conventional sense.	3																					
110	108		301								Old Man	But isn't that kiddo human?	2																					
111	109		301									The old man looks at you.																						
112	110		302								(Nod.)	111																						
113	111		301								Old Man	How time flies. I never expected to see a person from Eden with my own eyes.	2																					
114	112		301								Old Man	So... Care for something to eat?	2																					
115	113		301								Old Man	The outside is worn down and rusty, but it's safe to eat as long as the can doesn't bulge or leak.	2																					
116	114		301								Old Man	This is the last batch of cans produced before the Great Evacuation. These things can be preserved longer than you'd think.	2																					
117	115		301								Old Man	Even if it's only leftover soup from the past civilization.	2																					
118	116		302								No, but thanks.	117																						
119	117		202							1	2	3			1																			
120	118		201							1	500294																							
121	119		301							1	Old Man	Very well. I'm sure it's a bit preposterous for people who live in the clouds to eat gruel such as this.	1																					
122	120		302								It's not that. Aren't you on short supplies?	121	It's too precious for us to eat it.	121																				
123	121		301								Old Man	You're showing us sympathy? That sure is surprising...	1																					
124	122		301								Old Man	It's nothing special. Some people used to go catch fish in the sea.	1																					
125	123		301								Old Man	But recently, those red creatures—the "Hetero-Creatures" you mentioned—have thrown everyone into a panic. No one dares to venture too far out of the camp.	1																					
126	124		302								I'm sorry.	125																						
127	125		301								Old Man	Why the sudden apology?	1																					
128	126		301								Old Man	This isn't your fault. It's no one's fault.	1																					
129	127		301									The old man's attitude is kind and gentle, unlike his stern demeanor when you first met him.																						
130	128		401							1	211																							
131	129		301								Old Man	I scared you earlier, didn't I?	1																					
132	130		301								Old Man	I didn't mean to. Sometimes you just have to stand up for what you believe in.	1

134	132		201							2	500026		-450																					
135	133		301							1	Lee	And what is that exactly? Certain death?	2																					
136	134		301									The old man does not seem to take offense.																						
137	135		301								Old Man	Correct. We've decided to stay here and await death.	1																					
138	136		301									The man's old and hoarse voice seems to float away in the wind.

145	143		201							1	500294																							
146	144		301							1	Old Man	You may find our answer puzzling...	1																					
147	145		301								Old Man	...A group of people choosing to stay here and wait for their death—perhaps, even a cruel joke.	1																					
148	146		301								Old Man	But this is how we genuinely feel. It was our intent from the very beginning.	1																					
149	147		302								Why?	148																						
150	148		301								Old Man	Do you know about the Acadia Evacuation?	1																					
151	149		302								Yes.	150																						
152	150		301								Old Man	"When faced with impending doom, some people boarded Eden. While others just barely missed the boat." Isn't that how the story goes?	1																					
153	151		201							1	500166																							
154	152		301							1	Lucia	Yes.	1																					
155	153		201							1	500294																							
156	154		301							1	Old Man	In reality, that's not what happened. It wasn't entirely a matter of luck. Perhaps, some people just simply didn't want to leave.	1																					
157	155		301								Old Man	Yes, some people were unfortunately unable to board Eden.	1																					
158	156		301								Old Man	While others remained because their loved ones didn't get a ticket onto Eden.	1																					
159	157		301								Old Man	Some people stayed because they didn't want to abandon their homeland.	1																					
160	158		301								Old Man	Regardless of the reason, we chose to stay, and we accepted our fate.	1																					
161	159		301								Old Man	After making this choice, we planted our roots here and continued to fight.	1																					
162	160		201							1	1031001																							
163	161		301							1	Liv	But this place isn't suitable for humanity.	1																					
164	162		202							1					1																			
165	163		301									This is indeed the case. Even though the wasteland is far from nearby cities and so the Corrupted poses little threat, the cruelty of nature provides no safe harbor.																						
166	164		301									The old man nods in agreement.																						
167	165		201							1	500294																							
168	166		301							1	Old Man	Look at the land around you—this dry and ugly land.	1																					
169	167		301								Old Man	We originally lived in the city. We decided on this place and built our home here—albeit after great difficulty.	1																					
170	168		302								Why did you choose this place?	169																						
171	169		301								Old Man	Because nature is terrifying. Once civilization collapsed, nature reclaimed every corner of urban life.	1																					
172	170		301								Old Man	Without water, electricity or natural gas, skyscrapers became nothing but steel cages.	1																					
173	171		301								Old Man	Everyone died without dignity—like animals. At first, we had the capacity to cremate or bury the bodies. But soon, those left alive could bear it no more.	1																					
174	172		301								Old Man	The city was silent. Corpses continued to pile up. You can't imagine the despair—the sight and smell of people you once knew decaying in the city you once loved.	1																					
175	173		301								Old Man	Many people died from the Punishing Virus, and many died to infectious diseases. In order to survive and avoid the Corrupted, we left the city and ended up here.	1																					
176	174		301								Old Man	Not too close, but not too far. Here in this wasteland, we watch over humanity's former glory.	1																					
177	175		301								Old Man	Who would've thought that a group of "mice" such as ourselves would still live here to this very day.	1																					
178	176		203							1	0.25	-450																						
179	177		201							2	500166		450																					
180	178		301							1	Lucia	...	2																					
181	179		301								Old Man	Save your solemn expression.	1																					
182	180		301								Old Man	At first, we thought we wouldn't even last a year. But actually, it wasn't as bad as we thought.	1																					
183	181		301								Old Man	Thankfully, we had relics of civilization.	1																					
184	182		301								Old Man	You see, glass, metal, plastic... Even solar panels can be recycled. Although the semiconductor film is almost worn out, we can still rely on it to produce some electricity. At least it's enough to keep a few lights on at night.	1																					
185	183		301								Old Man	These items may seem like worthless garbage to you, but they are treasures to us.	1																					
186	184		301								Old Man	Just like this land.	1																					
187	185		301								Old Man	My wife and I built our house on this land with our own hands. It may be falling apart and always leaking, but it's my home.	1																					
188	186		301								Old Man	We may have lingered on our last breaths, but we kept each other going. The ten years I spent with her were a short happy time in my unfortunate life.	1																					
189	187		301								Old Man	When she passed away, I buried her on a distant hill overlooking the sea.	1																					
190	188		301								Old Man	Most of my generation that chose to stay during the Great Evacuation has turned to dust beneath the wheel of history. Now, there are only a few dozen of us left.	1																					
191	189		301								Old Man	But the descendants of those who died have now grown up and started to raise their own children.	1																					
192	190		301								Old Man	When it came time to bury my old friends, I buried them on the same hill overlooking the sea.	1																					
193	191		301								Old Man	Standing here, we can look back on the glory of the past and see the tombstones of our old friends.	1																					
194	192		301								Old Man	If we were to leave, then we would truly have nothing.	1																					
195	193		301								Old Man	Everything we cherish, believe, remember, and love will be completely shattered.	1																					
196	194		301								Old Man	Besides, even if you hadn't shown up, we wouldn't have lasted much longer.	1																					
197	195		301								Old Man	We scavenge all of our serum from the nearby city. That's bound to run out sooner or later.	1																					
198	196		301								Old Man	Everyone knows this, so we are ready to die at any time. Your arrival only means that we will meet our fate sooner.	1																					
199	197		301								Old Man	People born here were never optimistic to begin with.	1																					
200	198		301								Old Man	Hopeless and destitute. Desiring nothing so as to lose nothing.	1																					
201	199		301								Old Man	The only thing we have left is our love for this land.	1																					
202	200		301								Old Man	We knew our destination when we set foot on this path. We spent every day like it was our last.	1																					
203	201		301								Old Man	We were born here. We will die here.	1																					
204	202		302								But haven't your lives suffered by living like this?	203																						
205	203		202							1	2				1																			
206	204		201							1	500294																							
207	205		301							1	Old Man	No. You must know joy to know pain.	1																					
208	206		301								Old Man	We don't pursue the luxuries of Eden. We just want to be put to rest with our loved ones at our side when the time comes.	1																					
209	207		301								Old Man	If you still have compassion, please don't deprive us of our last request.	1																					
210	208		302								Why do you want to tell us all of this?	209																						
211	209		301								Old Man	Because I see weakness and timidity in your eyes.	1																					
212	210		301								Old Man	When all of this is over, you'll probably blame your incompetence and live with a heavy sense of guilt.	1																					
213	211		301								Old Man	So I want to tell you—don't.	1																					
214	212		301								Old Man	Don't feel any guilt.	1																					
215	213		301								Old Man	We've chosen our own path. You have completed your mission.	1																					
216	214		301								Old Man	Alright, that's enough.	1																					
217	215		301								All	...																						
218	216		302								I don't think this place is worthless.	217																						
219	217		301								Old Man	Oh?	1																					
220	218		302								(Repeat)	219																						
221	219		301								Old Man	Hearing someone from Eden say that...	1
