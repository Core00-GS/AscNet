4	4		301							1	Rosetta	With these units installed, the mission is basically over.	1																					
5	5		301								Rosetta	Commandant, come here if your survey equipment is all set up.	1																					
6	6		401							2	1515																							
7	7		301									Rosetta activates the module in her hand and begins to sync up the equipment.																						
8	8		301								Rosetta	Running at full capacity. Switching to automatic mode... Looks good.	1																					
9	9		301								Rosetta	Okay. Now, let's learn how to pitch a tent.	1																					
10	10		302								Why?!	11	Do we need to stay here overnight?	12																				
11	11	13	301								Rosetta	Because the last part of the mission requires us to keep watch here overnight. So, now's a good time to learn.	1																					
12	12		301								Rosetta	Yeah, our last mission is to keep watch here all night.	1																					
13	13		301								Rosetta	The equipment from Babylonia can help us set up camp quickly, but I still prefer doing things the old-fashioned way.	1																					
14	14		301								Rosetta	With that being said, Commandant, do you know that tents are divided into freestanding and non-freestanding ones?	1																					
15	15		302								Yeah.	16	Care to explain?	17																				
16	16	20	301								Rosetta	Ah, of course. You are a military personnel. I'll skip the basics then.	1																					
17	17		301								Rosetta	Simply put, freestanding tents have a support structure that makes it ideal for learners. Most of the fishermen in the ARU use these tents.	1																					
18	18		301								Rosetta	Non-freestanding tents require an added support structure, making them more difficult to assemble.	1																					
19	19		301								Rosetta	But, this allows them to be set up anywhere, which makes it more portable once you're familiar with it.	1																					
20	20		204							1	1																							
21	21		301								Rosetta	So, Commandant... Let's pitch a non-freestanding tent today.	1																					
22	22		204							1	8																							
23	23		301								Rosetta	(Mumbles) ...And that's not because I lost the support rods or anything.	1																					
24	24		202							1																								
25	25		301									On the vast and empty snowfield, even a quiet mumble can be heard crystal-clear.																						
26	26		201							1	500214																							
27	27		301							1	Rosetta	Non-freestanding tents typically use trees for support. So we need to find two trees roughly three meters apart.	1																					
28	28		302								Alright, let's go look.	29	...That might be a little difficult.	30																				
29	29	32	301								Rosetta	...Well, bad news is that most of the nearby trees were cut down while developing the ARU. I don't think we'll be able to find a suitable camping site.	1																					
30	30		301									Scanning around, not even a single tree can be seen among the vast snowfield.																						
31	31		301								Rosetta	...Yep.	1																					
32	32		301								Rosetta	We used to be able to find firewood here... Sigh, just my luck...	1																					
33	33		202							1																								
34	34		301									As if all hope was lost, Rosetta picks up a pebble and hurls it after a long exasperated sigh.																						
35	35		201							1	500214																							
36	36		301							1	Rosetta	Oh. This time, it skipped twelve times. A vast improvement.	1																					
37	37		301								???	Flabby Arctic rolls... Who's throwing rocks into the water?!																						
38	38		301									An angry wave surges up, revealing a familiar figure.																						
39	39		201							1	500208																							
40	40		302								Oh, another bullseye?!	41	You live down there or something?!	42																				
41	41	44	301							1	Bionic Bear	So, you ARE doing it on purpose!	1																					
42	42		301								Bionic Bear	I live on shore, obviously. This is just my favorite spot to sunbathe!	1																					
43	43		301									Look at the ARU technology. Their bionic bears are so realistically made that they even sunbathe.																						
44	44		301								Bionic Bear	Try living in me shoes, aye? Try getting a rock to your noggin every time you clock off from the climate station!	1																					
45	45		301								Bionic Bear	And what is it with you two?! Do you humans and Constructs have nothing better to do?	1																					
46	46		201							1	500214																							
47	47		301							1	Rosetta	We told you last time. We're on a mission.	1																					
48	48		201							1	500208																							
49	49		301							1	Bionic Bear	...Oh yeah, you did, aye, didn't you? So what's with the rocks again? Lost another module?	1																					
50	50		302								We don't have a place to pitch our tent.	51	First of all though, I didn't throw the rock.	52																				
51	51	53	301								Bionic Bear	A tent...? You camping here or something?	1																					
52	52		301								Bionic Bear	Whatever, it's all the same. Why do you have this pile of fabric on the ground anyway? Are you trying to camp or something?	1																					
53	53		201							1	500214	8																						
54	54		301							1	Rosetta	I just wanted to teach Commandant how to pitch tents in the Arctic for the final mission.	1																					
55	55		204							1	14																							
56	56		301								Rosetta	But this ended up not going as planned. The tent is going nowhere.	1																					
57	57		201							1	500208																							
58	58		301							1	Bionic Bear	You two are a bunch of brain wranglers... But if you just need a shelter, I have an idea.	1																					
59	59		302								Save us, Master Bear!	60	You don't mean the ocean, do you?	61																				
60	60	62	301								Bionic Bear	Don't call me Master Bear, makes me sound like some weirdo... Whatever, if you need help then let's build an igloo.	1																					
61	61		301								Bionic Bear	What kind of numbskull idea is that? I'm saying you can build an igloo.	1																					
62	62		201							1	500214	4																						
63	63		301							1	Rosetta	Right... An igloo also works. Not to mention it can be built anywhere... I completely forgot about it.	1																					
64	64		201							1	500208																							
65	65		301							1	Bionic Bear	Aight, quit dozing and get cracking. Construct, you'll do the shaping. 【kuroname】, you pile up the snow.	1																					
66	66		302								How big do you want the snowballs?	67	We just need to pile it up?	70																				
67	67		301								Bionic Bear	About waist-high, but don't make them too big. Last time, a ten-meter tall snowball came rolling onto shore and just about scared me half to death.	1																					
68	68		201							1	500214																							
69	69	72	301							1	Rosetta	...	1																					
70	70		201							1	500208																							
71	71		301								Bionic Bear	Just mush it all into a ball. The Construct can handle the finer details later.	1																					
72	72		202							1																								
73	73		301									You both follow the bionic bear's safety-first instructions and quickly build an igloo. Rosetta uses her spear to carve a perfect sphere out of the snowball.																						
74	74		301									And finally—																						
75	75		201							1	500208																							
76	76		301							1	Bionic Bear	Good work. You make Master Bear proud.	1																					
77	77		301									An immaculate igloo with a streamlined arc stands before you. The pristine snow is even glistering under the sunlight.																						
78	78		301									Rosetta covers the entrance of the igloo with the tent canvas to block the freezing wind.																						
79	79		201							1	500208																							
80	80		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Bionic Bear	Work's done, fellas. Let's go in and see if this igloo's a warmer!	1																					
81	81		202							1					1																			
82	82		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
83	83		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The three of you crawl into the igloo. Without any light, you cannot get a feel of your surroundings.																						
84	84		301								Bionic Bear	Well. Feels pretty warm in here.																						
85	85		301									Like what the bear says, you feel an immediate temperature difference upon entering the igloo, but—																						
86	86		401							1	205																							
87	87		301								Rosetta	It's a bit cramped in here...																						
88	88		301									Though equipped with the knowledge of the how-to, no one has ever built an igloo before, causing this size miscalculation.																						
89	89		301									In the end, you have created an... S-sized snow hut.																						
90	90		301								Bionic Bear	Oi, Construct, can't you put your weapon outside? Your pokey bits are stabbing at me...																						
91	91		301								Rosetta	Sorry, but you'll have to get over it. You never know when we might be attacked. Only soldiers that can endure can seize the final victory.																						
92	92		301								Bionic Bear	I'm not here to make war, girl!																						
93	93		301								Rosetta	Ah!																						
94	94		401							2	1503																							
95	95		301									The bear props up involuntarily in an almost slapstick retort, causing the small igloo to collapse and bury everyone in snow.																						
96	96		201							1	500214	8																						
97	97		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Rosetta	Ugh... Just my lucky day.	1
