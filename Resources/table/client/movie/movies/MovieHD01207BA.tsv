58	58		301								Lee	There was sticker residue on the door frame. The size looked exactly like the couplets you have.	1																					
59	59		302								So there is a high chance that these couplets can be used there?	60																						
60	60		301								Lee	I'm not sure either, but it's worth a try.	1																					
61	61		302								Now there is only one question left.	62

74	74		301									There are also some familiar faces...																						
75	75		301									The portraits of Kamui and Camu are pasted on both door panels. Kamui is having his usual silly smile, while Camu looks gloomier than ever, almost on the edge of an explosion.
