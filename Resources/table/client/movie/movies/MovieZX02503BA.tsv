5	5		301									Pulao gets off the mountain from the east. With her arms crossed and eyes closed, she mumbles to herself.

8	8		301									In front of Pulao are lots of road signs, and each points to a different path. On every sign is the same "To East" text.

10	10		301								Pulao	But this is way too much!	1																					
11	11		301								Pulao	This is not about choosing between a "dark, small road" or a "bright, wide road."	1																					
12	12		301								Pulao	Look at this one, the entire road is green and slimy. That one is burning with sparks. None of them looks like a safe path!	1																					
13	13		204							1																								
14	14		301								Pulao	...	1																					
15	15		301								Pulao	Besides, this grinning man with a ponytail on the road sign looks so familiar.	1																					
16	16		301								???	O lost child, are you troubled by which path to take?																						
17	17		301								Pulao	Eh? Who's there?	1																					
18	18		301								???	I am the light in darkness, the sage who casts away confusion. You may call me the Navigator or the Immortal.

23	23		301								Pulao	That sounds pretty cool.	1																					
24	24		301								???	Not that cool. Just a little.	2																					
25	25		301								Pulao	Um, Mr. Navigator, do you know how to go to the east? I'd like to find Mr. Big Fish.	1																					
26	26		301								???	You have come to the right person. All those titles are but fancy nicknames to describe my job. Most of the time, people prefer to call me by my profession.	2																					
27	27		301									The man pulls his ironed suit. A pale blue data panel appears on his chest, showing his profession: tour guide.																						
28	28		204							1																								
29	29		301								Tour Guide	I present to you, a senior tour guide with twelve years of experience.	2																					
30	30		301									He takes a flag out of nowhere and strides forward, but pauses after a few steps and looks back at Pulao.																						
31	31		301								Tour Guide	Don't worry, my service is free. Just give me a 5-star rating and leave a comment that is over 100 words long.	2																					
32	32		204							1	6																							
33	33		301								Pulao	Um... Okay.	1																					
34	34		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Tour Guide	Deal. Let's delay no more and head out. Hope I can get a few more orders and good reviews today.	2

44	44		301								Tour Guide	(Panting)	2																					
45	45		301								Tour Guide	I have never taken this road before. Never thought it could be so dangerous.	2																					
46	46		301								Pulao	Wow, have you never been here before?	1																					
47	47		301								Tour Guide	I have to. Gotta work on my reviews.	2

51	51		301								Tour Guide	Speaking of which, you really are brave, girl.	2																					
52	52		301								Tour Guide	I have been guiding along, but without you, I would have died long ago.	2																					
53	53		204							1	1																							
54	54		301								Pulao	It's important to help each other. You have helped me go around many traps. Without you, I would have also been in big trouble.	1																					
55	55		301								Pulao	But you are panting a lot. Are you really okay? Shall we take another break?	1																					
56	56		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Tour Guide	I'm feeling a lot better now. Let's keep going. I still need to pick up my kid from school. We should be pretty close... I think.	2
