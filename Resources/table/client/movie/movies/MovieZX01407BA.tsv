4	4		301								???	Oh. You think I'm playing her like a puppet?																						
5	5		301								???	Are you not?																						
6	6		301								???	I can only influence her dreams. I can't control her directly.																						
7	7		301								???	Then what's the deal with the bionics?!																						
8	8		301								???	I only said I'd give you a chance, not work with you as an equal. If you want me to uphold my end of the promise, you'd better go harder at it, dear.																						
9	9		301								???	...You!																						
10	10		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				???	Seems like you really want out, Amberia. Don't you?

14	12		301							1	Staessen	You people... What are you trying to get outta me...	1																					
15	13		301									After ensuring the safety of the area, you and Rosetta went over to Captain Staessen according to Rosetta's proposal and asked him about Amberia.																						
16	14		301									You had expected some clues or answers, but the result was unexpected.																						
17	15		301									Upon hearing Amberia's name, Staessen immediately dismissed the guards with an apprehensive expression on his face. He must know something.

20	16		301							1	Atiel	You... You can't possibly know about Amberia, can you?!	2																					
21	17		301									Atiel could not help but lose her temper over Staessen's inane muttering. She stomps forth and grabs his collar.																						
22	18		301								Staessen	Hey!	1																					
23	1004		201							1	500201		400																					
24	19		301							1	Simon	Stop, Atiel! He's on our side!	1																					
25	20		301								Atiel	...	2																					
26	21		301									Atiel lets go, but gives Staessen a piercing glare.

28	1006		201							2	500199		400																					
29	22		301							1	Rosetta	So what is it? Is Amberia still alive?	1																					
30	23		301								Staessen	I, I...	2																					
31	1007		302								We need to know everything that's going on.	24	Do you want to relive that tragedy?	25																				
32	24	1008	301								Staessen	What's the point? It's not like you can do anything about it. This will just be like the previous tides, it'll come to an end soon... Ah...	2																					
33	25	1008	301								Staessen	There won't be no "tragedy." We easily snuffed out the last tide, and we'll do it again this time... Ah...	2																					
34	1008		201							1	500088	4	-400																					
35	26		301							1	Diana	So, she really is alive then?	1																					
36	27		301									Staessen's broken mumblings confirm the suspicions within your heart.																						
37	28		301								Diana	Tell me, Captain. Why did you try to cover it up? Where is she now? How can you tolerate this?!	1																					
38	29		301									Even Diana lets out her anger. The name Amberia is evidently a monument in the heart of the Forest Guard.																						
39	30		301								Staessen	...I wasn't trying to cover it up. No, I never did!	2																					
40	31		301								Diana	What?	1																					
41	32		301								Staessen	It was the previous captain, and the ones before. THEY did that! Every new captain is ordered to keep it a secret. If I had known this from the beginning, I would never have tried to be one!	2																					
42	33		301									Like a crumbling tower, Staessen grabs and pulls at his hair, shrieking angrily at you and the others.																						
43	1009		302								Then, can you tell us the truth?	34	Why keep it a secret then?	35																				
44	34	37	301								Staessen	...Ugh, why'd it turn out like this?	2																					
45	35	36	301								Staessen	I wasn't trying to! But who'd believe me? And you know what happens to traitors!	2																					
46	36	37	301								Staessen	Not to mention, if I were to tell everyone that Amberia was still alive, the ARU would delve into chaos. If we ran into any trouble during so, we'd all...	2																					
47	37		301								Staessen	...Oh, forget it! I don't care anymore! You wanna know the truth, I'll tell you truth! But you better not tell anyone else!	2																					
48	38		301									The room falls into silence. Staessen begins spitting out everything he knows.																						
49	39		301								Staessen	I don't know exactly HOW, but the ARU used a code to suppress Amberia.	2																					
50	1010		201							1	500201		-400																					
51	40		301							1	Simon	A code... So some kind of preset authentication?	1																					
52	41		301								Staessen	Something like that... Anyway, the leaders in control of the code put Amberia into a deep sleep. They then sealed her and the bionics away somewhere in this tundra.	2																					
53	42		301								Staessen	...First things first though. I don't know where either.	2																					
54	1011		201							1	500206	5	-400																					
55	43		301							1	Atiel	...How can you NOT KNOW? You're not messing with us, are you?	1																					
56	44		301								Staessen	I REALLY DON'T! All I heard from the previous captain was that Amberia's nightmares are what's controlling the tide.	2																					
57	1012		201							1	500201		-400																					
58	45		301							1	Simon	The nightmares are disturbing her M.I.N.D., causing the linked bionics to attack people on the surface?	1																					
59	46		301								Staessen	That's what should be the case this time round as well. The bionics also mentioned Amberia, yeah?	2																					
60	47		301								Staessen	When her nightmare ends, she will return to her deep slumber. That will put the bionics to rest.	2																					
61	48		301								Simon	That doesn't seem likely.	1																					
62	49		301								Staessen	...Why?	2																					
63	50		301								Simon	Before that, I need to confirm something, Boss. Did you see bionics carrying away energy tanks before our rendezvous?	1																					
64	1013		302								You mean the energy tanks in the base...?	51	What do you think they're planning?	52																				
65	51	53	301								Simon	Yeah, that's what I was in a hurry to confirm just now. Most of the energy in the base were stolen.	1																					
66	52	53	301								Simon	They must be trying to activate some sort of special machine.	1																					
67	53		301								Staessen	Wait... You don't mean? They're hauling the energy tanks to Amberia?	2																					
68	54		301								Simon	Not much else they'd need so many energy tanks for, I'm afraid... Looks like sleeping beauty is about to wake up.	1																					
69	55		301								Staessen	No... That can't be. If she awakens, there's no way we can defeat her. She must be trying to get revenge on the ARU...	2																					
70	56		301									The pace of Staessen's speech quickens, growing more erratic by the second. He tries to scamper for the shipyard, but is blocked off by Rosetta.

73	57		301							1	Rosetta	We'll have to fight to see if we win or lose. But for now, we still have a way out... The code... Do you really not have any idea about it?	1																					
74	1016		203							1	0.25	-400																						
75	1017		201							2	500199	5	400																					
76	58		301							1	Staessen	...You might find something in the research lab. I'm sure you Forest Guards are familiar with it—the lab used to make Constructs.	2																					
77	59		301								Staessen	I don't know what's in there, but you should hurry. If you can find the code, we can put Amberia back to sleep again.	2																					
78	500		204							1	4																							
79	60		301								Rosetta	Whether she's back or not, as long as we have the code, we will always have the upper hand, huh...	1																					
80	1018		302								Well then, let's go search for the code.	61	Do we still have time?	62																				
81	61		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Rosetta	Heh, we think alike.	1																					
82	62	1019	301								Rosetta	No other choice, Commandant. Let's get going.	1
