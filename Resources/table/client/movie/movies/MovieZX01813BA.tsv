11	11		202							1					1																			
12	12		301									Kamui's noisy voice projected from the direction of Wanshi's recovery room.																						
13	13		301									Through the opened door of the recovery room, Wanshi sees the cans that he had put in the cabinet.																						
14	14		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Kamui accidentally discovered a slightly swollen metal can in Wanshi's storage. It reminded Wanshi of his distant past.

18	18		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Broken stone slabs and steel bars stand in the ruins. Smoke and dust in the air cast an oppressive haze on the area.																						
19	19		301									The surrounding craters speak to the kind of devastation wrought on this land.																						
20	20		301									Oil flows quietly along the terrain, filling craters along the way and finally gathering in recesses of the street.																						
21	21		401							2	1516																							
22	22		301									A pair of military boots steps into a puddle, causing black ripples to disturb the oily surface.																						
23	23		301									The ripples bump into a mechanical arm submerged in the oil. Right at that moment, the mechanical arm seems to receive a signal, stirring it from silence.																						
24	24		301									It twitches wildly, grabbing onto the surrounding wreckage as it tries to free its broken limbs from the crushing weight of the ruins.																						
25	25		401							2	1510																							
26	26		301									Finally, its attempt at dragging itself out is ended by the dull thud of a gunshot.

28	28		301							1	???	Looks like there are some stragglers. I thought all of Corrupted near the southern defensive line were alerted by the large-scale clean-up and suppression operation led by the Egrets.	1																					
29	29		301									The shooter slings the rifle on his shoulder while it is still cooling down, then looks down at the Corrupted he had just stopped from moving.																						
30	30		301								???	Wanshi, the file I'm looking for still isn't popping up on the scan. What about you?	1

45	45		301									Hearing the sudden sound on the silent comms, the Construct known as Troy performs a tactical roll to the side, avoiding a burst of air as it ruptures by his ear.																						
46	46		401							2	1508																							
47	47		301									It was the sound of the attack from a large Corrupted suddenly appearing in front of Troy. Building debris and the remains of smaller Corrupted fall off its torso.																						
48	48		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryWhiteNew.prefab	2																							
49	49		301									As Troy raises his gun and aims at the large Corrupted, a silver orb of light fires from the direction where he last stood.																						
50	50		401							2	1503																							
51	51		301									Following the blast, the Corrupted begins to disintegrate from one of its arms. The mechanical joints shatters into fragments and splashes into the oil-filled crater.																						
52	52		301									Finally, a silver orb of light penetrates the fractured memory shell towering off to the side. It falls backward from the inertia of the impact, leaving mechanical residue on the ground.

63	63		301								Wanshi	Relax. That was the last one...	1																					
64	64		301								Troy	Hmph, what makes you say that?	2																					
65	65		204							1																								
66	66		301								Wanshi	While you were running around looking for the data files...	1																					
67	67		301								Wanshi	I was here scanning for enemies and taking them out. I didn't even have to move an inch. Quick and easy...	1																					
68	68		204							1	8																							
69	69		301								Troy	Fine, whatever.	2																					
70	70		301									Troy sighs, then climbs over a structure and continues to search the ruins.																						
71	71		301								Troy	Anyway, the ruins sure are quiet.	2																					
72	72		301								Troy	...	2																					
73	73		301								Troy	Hey, Wanshi. When did you join Strike Hawk?	2																					
74	74		301								Troy	Now that you're awake, I figured I'd ask while I still had the chance. You've been dozing on and off, so I didn't want to bother.	2																					
75	75		301								Wanshi	...	1																					
76	76		301								Troy	...	2																					
77	77		301								Troy	Sigh... Doze off again?	2

79	79		301								Wanshi	It just happed by some weird twist of fate.	1

81	81		202							1	2				1																			
82	82		301									Perhaps due to Wanshi's sudden response over the comms or because he was not expecting that answer, either way, Troy slips while climbing the crumbling wall to the ruins.																						
83	83		401							2	1509																							
84	84		301									Right as Troy is about to fall off the wall, he hears the revving of an engine underfoot. A faint white light appears underneath him, steadily catching him in midair.																						
85	85		201							2	500298																							
86	86		301							1	Troy	Phew... Scared me there for a second.	2																					
87	87		301									Troy pats his chest with a free hand, then places his feet back on a sturdy section of the crumbling wall. After regaining his footing, he continues to climb.																						
88	88		301								Troy	Fate, huh? That's nice.	2																					
89	89		301								Troy	I heard that scouts don't have to go to the front line. That's why I joined.	2																					
90	90		301								Troy	But you Strike Hawks are in a league of your own.	2

95	95		301								Troy	Of course. What scout hasn't heard of Strike Hawk?	2																					
96	96		204							1																								
97	97		301								Wanshi	But don't elite teams usually have a human called... um... a commandant?	1																					
98	98		301								Troy	That's just an ordinary elite team. Don't you know who your Captain is?	2																					
99	99		301								Troy	Chrome is a perfect Construct equipped with a specialized Inver-Device who is responsible for serving as the team's commandant.	2																					
100	100		301								Troy	Oh, and the other Strike Hawks are equally one in a million. Any mission with Strike Hawk is virtually guaranteed to be a success.	2																					
101	101		204							1	7																							
102	102		301								Wanshi	You don't say... I just thought there was something special about our Captain and Kamui.	1																					
103	103		204							1																								
104	104		301								Troy	How could you be so oblivious to all of this? You don't know how much I envy you.	2																					
105	105		301								Troy	As for me, my combat abilities are as ordinary as they come.	2																					
106	106		301								Troy	All I can do is run fast and keep my mouth shut. That's why Commander Nikola assigned me to this mission.	2																					
107	107		301								Troy	Honestly, I may not be afraid to fight Corrupted, but I won't be first in line to fight them head-on.	2																					
108	108		301								Troy	So, thanks for the help just now.	2																					
109	109		301								Wanshi	Hmph, it was nothing.	1																					
110	110		301								Troy	Haha, no need to be so modest. It was an honest compliment. Just take it.	2

113	113		301									After climbing to the top of the crumbling wall while chatting with Wanshi, Troy can now scan the large area below.																						
114	114		301									Troy sees patches of Corrupted and human remains piled up on the ground, alluding to a tragic battle that had taken place here.																						
115	115		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Troy bows his head in a moment of silence, then jumps down from the crumbling wall and continues onward.

122	121		301								Troy	But scenes like this bloodbath here are the real reason I won't step foot on the front line.	2																					
123	122		301								Troy	It's ridiculous that soldiers pay their lives in exchange for a total retreat.	2																					
124	123		301								Troy	We're supposedly bound by duty to carry out orders.	2																					
125	124		301								Troy	But every time I see these scenes, I still can't help ask these questions from the bottom of my heart.	2																					
126	125		301								Wanshi	However, the answers to these questions are even more troubling...	1																					
127	126		401							2	1515																							
128	127		301									Troy smiles somberly, then tapped the position of his temple, causing a fluorescent panel to pop up in front of his eyes.																						
129	128		301								Troy	It's not here either.	2																					
130	129		301								Troy	Wanshi, when will this endless war end?	2																					
131	130		301								Wanshi	Uh... I don't know.	1																					
132	131		301								Troy	What a pity. If one person dies on the battlefield, they're a hero. Ten people, they're martyrs. One million people, they're just a statistic.	2																					
133	132		301								Troy	We already sacrificed so many people.	2																					
134	133		301								Troy	Is it true that our mission will only truly be complete once we achieve victory and humanity has taken back Earth?	2																					
135	134		301								Wanshi	...I don't know. But I had a dream about us winning the war recently.	1																					
136	135		301								Wanshi	A spark spreads from a faint orb of light, igniting change all around the world.	1																					
137	136		301								Wanshi	Finally, the spark ignites the entire Earth, but gradually fades after burning...	1																					
138	137		301								Wanshi	Even if we win a temporary victory against the Corrupted, the Punishing Virus won't be eradicated so easily...	1																					
139	138		301								Troy	It was just a dream though.	2																					
140	139		301								Wanshi	It's just not a dream...	1																					
141	140		301								Wanshi	The Punishing Virus has caught us off guard more than once.	1																					
142	141		301								Wanshi	Just as human beings have spent millions of years building their own civilization on the surface of Earth...	1																					
143	142		301								Wanshi	The Punishing Virus is also adapting and corrupting the land in its own way.	1																					
144	143		301								Wanshi	If we don't find a way to eradicate it...	1																					
145	144		301								Wanshi	When conditions such as environment and time align, one day the Punishing Virus will evolve into an existence beyond our comprehension.	1																					
146	145		301								Troy	Well... But at least it hasn't come to that yet, has it?	2																					
147	146		301								Troy	It's always best to plan ahead, but we still need to live in the present. Right?	2																					
148	147		301								Wanshi	Uh... Sure.	1
