10	10		301								Vera	It's probably the angles. I think the armor of that Zan-whatever is crafted very nicely.	1																					
11	11		301								Karenina	Tsk. Next time I'll make sure I hit a home run.	2

16	16		301								Zanzibaron	But I cannot fall yet. I must protect the artifact...	1		3																			
17	17		301									Zanzibaron ignored us and opened the wall behind. Inside the wall was a strange-shaped jade.

22	22		301								Camu	I guess so. I was expecting the reward after beating him, but he took it out himself. Nice!	2

34	33		301									Camu had already rushed forward and picked up the jade. He pulled the sword out with the other hand, and pointed it at Zanzibaron's head.				1

36	35		301								Zanzibaron	Urgh, we Demons...must...	1																					
37	36		301									Still, Zanzibaron struggled forward, completely ignoring Camu and the blade that could take his life any time. He only had the jade in his eyes.																						
38	37		301								Camu	What's wrong with this guy?	2																					
39	38		301									Slightly shocked by this special move that never appeared in the game, Camu backed off a little, but he soon forced Zanzibaron back again with his blade.

42	41		302								So Hassen really is evil, huh?	42	What do we have to do with the King?	43																				
43	42	44	301								Zanzibaron	Isn't that obvious? Give the artifact back to me!	1																					
44	43	44	301								Zanzibaron	He must have told you to come here. Give the artifact back to me!	1

49	48		301									When Zanzibaron was about to charge again, Camu unleashed a slash so fast that separated the space inside the room.																						
50	49		301								Zanzibaron	Darn you, heroes! This will not end like this!																						
51	50		301									He then fell off the castle together with the dismembered room, making a loud sound.

57	56		301								Camu	...	3																					
58	57		301								Vera	Just a game character doing his programmed moves. Now we have defeated the Demon General and got the artifact, let's just go.	1																					
59	58		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Camu	True. We may be able to unlock some new stories after defeating the first Boss.	3
