5	6		302								Ah!	7																						
6	7		301								???	My apologies. Did I startle you?

10	10		301							1	Bianca	I've been waiting for you, Commandant.	1																					
11	11		302								Why?	12	What's wrong?	12																				
12	12		301								Bianca	You seemed a little upset during the evening when you had to leave.	1																					
13	13		301								Bianca	I also think our date shouldn't end like that, which is why I want to give it a proper conclusion.	1																					
14	14		302								Bianca...	200	That's not necessary.	15																				
15	200	16	301								Bianca	...Commandant.	1																					
16	15		301								Bianca	...I disagree.	1																					
17	16		301								Bianca	Let's go, Commandant. I'll walk you back.	1																					
18	17		302								I wouldn't want to trouble you!	18	That's very kind of you.	19																				
19	18	20	301								Bianca	Let's move past the pleasantries.	1																					
20	19		301								Bianca	You're welcome.	1

23	21		301									Silence fills the air at once. All you can hear is the sound of your overlapping footsteps.

25	23		301							1	Bianca	I had a good time today—	1																					
26	24		302								Did you have a good time today—	25																						
27	25		301								Bianca	...	1																					
28	26		302								You first.	104	What were you trying to say?	104																				
29	104		401							1	207																							
30	27		301								Bianca	...I had a great time today.	1																					
31	28		204							1	1																							
32	29		301								Bianca	Going to gatherings with you, cooking for you, and watching a movie with you has made me very happy.	1																					
33	30		204							1																								
34	31		301								Bianca	Perhaps my usual sternness has not made me very popular.	1																					
35	32		302								That's not true. That's what made you Bianca.	33	No way, Bianca. You're first on the Date-a-Construct chart!	34																				
36	33	37	301								Bianca	But it troubles me sometimes as well.	1																					
37	34		301								Bianca	...What is that?	1																					
38	35		302								Cough—nothing.	36																						
39	36		301								Bianca	Anyway, it troubles me sometimes as well.	1																					
40	37		301								Bianca	Why would I have conflicting thoughts when I claim to abide by my faith...?	1																					
41	38		302								There's nothing wrong with your faith.	39																						
42	39		301								Bianca	...	1																					
43	40		302								Your faith creates the very foundation of who you are.	41																						
44	41		301								Bianca	...	1																					
45	42		302								And those conflicts... smooth out the edges.	43																						
46	43		301								Bianca	...	1																					
47	44		302								Which makes you... you, Bianca.	45																						
48	45		301								Bianca	...Do you really believe that, Commandant?	1																					
49	46		302								Of course. When have I ever lied to you?	47																						
50	47		301								Bianca	You're right. I've chosen this path, and I will see it through.	1																					
51	48		301								Bianca	I will sacrifice everything for what I believe to be "right" until the day the Punishing Virus vanishes from this Earth.	1																					
52	49		302								I admire your kindness.	52	I admire your determination.	50																				
53	50		301								Bianca	Commandant... why do you think I'm determined?	1																					
54	51	54	301								Bianca	Everyone else thinks I'm stubborn.	1																					
55	52		301								Bianca	Commandant... why do you think I'm kind?	1																					
56	53		301								Bianca	Everyone else thinks I'm cruel.	1																					
57	54		301								Bianca	...	1																					
58	55		302								Why do you act so prudent on your missions, Bianca?	56	Why did you join the Purifying Force, Bianca?	57																				
59	56	58	301								Bianca	It's illogical to carry out purification when I have not confirmed the risks the targets pose with my own investigations.	1																					
60	57		301								Bianca	Those infected Constructs... are in such unimaginable pain that someone has to free them from their torments.	1																					
61	58		302								Isn't that kindness?	59	Isn't that determination?	59																				
62	59		301								Bianca	Commandant...	1																					
63	60		302								I had a lovely time today.	101	I'm glad I could go on a date with you.	61

72	67		302								Because you're one of us, duh.	68																						
73	68		301								Bianca	...	1																					
74	69		301								Bianca	We've arrived, Commandant.	1																					
75	70		302								Whoa. That was fast.	71	Can't believe a lady walked me home!	71																				
76	71		204							1	1																							
77	72		301								Bianca	Then, I think this concludes our date. Properly.	1
