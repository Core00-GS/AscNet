4	4		301			DialogEnable	RImgBg1Shake					Just when the Musashi unit is about to catch you, you see a blade flashing past, slashing the Musashi in half.																						
5	5		301									The one who protected you was the Corrupted that had to run away from you, right at the beginning of this whole drama.																						
6	6		401							1	206																							
7	7		301									You see a familiar expression in the Corrupted's eyes, strong, unwavering, and reminding you of someone.

15	15		301							1	Vera	Shouldn't you have run away, Lucia? Why are you still here?	2																					
16	16		301								Lucia	I'm only here to help rescue Commandant, just like everyone else.	1																					
17	17		301								Vera	I'm asking you why you're on your own. You could have met up with other Constructs...	2																					
18	18		301								Lucia	In that case, I would still be seen as a Corrupted and got attacked, just like before.	1																					
19	19		301								Lucia	Even if the others recognized me, Commandant's perception would still have been compromised and would likely give an order to attack.	1																					
20	20		301								Lucia	...And that will damage our relationship. Isn't that your true purpose?	1																					
21	21		301								Vera	Not entirely... But if you say so, that means my plan has at least partially worked, don't you think?	2																					
22	22		301								Lucia	Not in the slightest.	1																					
23	23		301								Vera	Are you kidding? The commandant you are protecting right now was attacking you, a "Corrupted", with no mercy.	2																					
24	24		301								Vera	The same commandant who was hesitating during the last question.	2																					
25	25		301								Vera	Are you sure such a person is worth your protection and trust?	2																					
26	26		301								Lucia	At first, when Commandant thought I was a Corrupted and could not hear my words...	1																					
27	27		301								Lucia	I never thought that could shock my M.I.N.D. so much.	1																					
28	28		301								Vera	Then—	2																					
29	29		301								Lucia	But there's one thing that I'm always certain.	1																					
30	30		301								Lucia	It doesn't matter what Commandant sees me as, because I only have one thing to do, right from the beginning.	1																					
31	31		301								Lucia	And that is, to become Commandant's blade.	1																					
32	32		301								Vera	You...!	2

38	38		201							1	500142																							
39	39		301							1	Lucia	Because I cut off the control devices to the connection chamber, the ones you planted nearby before I entered the mansion. No need to thank me for my return gift... Happy April Fool's Day, Vera.	1
