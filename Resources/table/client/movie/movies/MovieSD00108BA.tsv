41	41		204							2																								
42	42		301								Liv	At that time, I just stayed at home and watched my brothers and sisters set off fireworks. I imagined what it would be like if I lit fireworks by myself.	2																					
43	43		301								Liv	The color, shape and bang of fireworks...	2

50	50		301								Lee	The reason why so many humans cherished Christmas in the past is precisely because they felt connected with the people they care about, so they had a feeling of belonging.	1

68	68		204							2	1																							
69	69		301								Liv	You're right, Nanami. Back in the day, people would make wishes during special occasions. They'd make wishes, then the bells and fireworks would send their wishes to Santa.	2																					
70	70		301								Liv	Then Santa Claus would climb down their chimneys while everyone was asleep and secretly put gifts under their Christmas tree. My mother told me this story before.	2																					
71	71		201							1	1021001	1	-400
