5	5		301									All that was left of the Riot form was warped metal and broken circuitry. Some of its systems were still functioning, enough to shed ominous light through the dents and gashes in its carapace, but nothing else.

7	7		301							1	Lucia	It's abnormal for Commandant to not respond. Murol, Xun, we're pulling out.	1																					
8	8		301									My orders transmitted, I sheathed my blade and dashed for the rear, stopping only when I noticed the absence of following footfalls.

14	14		301									In the aftermath of the battle, only Riot was left.																						
15	15		301			RImgBg1Shake						The EM noose was still wound tightly around the non-functional hulk, but the Constructs who bound it in the first place were nowhere to be found.

18	18		301							1	Lucia	Now is not the time for games. Report!	1																					
19	19		301									Something frustrating in me ticked. My growl of frustration echoed in the empty field.																						
20	20		301								Lucia	Murol! Xun!	1																					
21	21		301									I searched everywhere, even tearing down the equipment they've set up to look for data echoes, but there was nothing. Not even a whisper.																						
22	22		301								Lucia	Right, Hiro was here too. His channel is...	1																					
23	23		301									————																						
24	24		301								Lucia	...Empty?																						
25	25		301									Not even a reminder of a failed connection. The channel was empty, the address vacant. My unasked questions fell on absent ears.

32	32		301							1	Nikola	Still with us, Lucia? I was asking for your opinion on your new teammates, Lee and Liv.	1																					
33	1156		301							1	Nikola	There are other unallocated Constructs. By merit of your performance, I'll allow you to cycle through them until you find the right candidates.	1																					
34	33		301									The battlefield, the Riot, was gone. Only Commander Nikola stands in front of me, an open file in his hand, his gaze expectant as I ponder the future of Gray Raven.

39	38		301								Nikola	...Hmph, so be it. Consider them part of Gray Raven from this day forward.	1

41	40		301									It was only after the Commander left that I released an unintentionally held breath. I backed up against the wall, M.I.N.D. reeling at the pain of rampant destabilization.																						
42	41		301									Every time I recall this specific memory, the data is always so scrambled to the point that my retrieval process glitches, skipping ahead to the days leading up to my first meeting with Commandant.																						
43	42		301									Though it may not be much to go on, I do have my theories...																						
44	43		301									Theories on Luna, my past teammates, Commandant...																						
45	44		301									The Lucia they knew...																						
46	45		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					...could not be the me right now.
