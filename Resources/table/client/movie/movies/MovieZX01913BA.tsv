4	4		201							1	500309																							
5	5		301							1	Chrome	Based on our previous expedition, it's unlikely that agent Luna is in here. Our top priority should be cleaning up any Red Tide we come across.	1																					
6	6		301								Chrome	As for Vonnegut, we don't have much intel, but according to Gabriel, there's likely another agent nearby. This is a stealth mission. Avoid direct confrontation with them at all costs.	1

8	8		201							2	500166	5	400

10	10		201							1	1081001		-400																					
11	11		301							1	Kamui	We also don't know if the figure who jumped in before the smoke cleared is still down there.	1																					
12	12		301								Kamui	Think it was Cinderelik or the other agent?	1																					
13	13		201							1	500309		-400																					
14	14		301							1	Chrome	No, Vonnegut said there was another intruder.	1																					
15	15		301								Lucia	Then who could it have been?	2																					
16	16		301								Chrome	When we were looking for the entrance, there was someone following us just out of our line of sight.	1																					
17	17		301								Chrome	We couldn't see who it was, but based on their behavior and footsteps having traces of Punishing Virus, I suspect it was an Ascendant. Not to mention, they were familiar with the area.	1																					
18	18		301								Lucia	...	2																					
19	19		301								Chrome	When we came in contact with Vonnegut, he said to Gabriel, "I've enhanced your frame. Don't let her get the best of you like last time."	1																					
20	20		301								Lucia	Like last time? We only know of two Ascendants capable of "getting the best" of Gabriel.	2																					
21	21		302								Was it Luna or Alpha?	22																						
22	22		201							1	1081001		-400																					
23	23		301							1	Kamui	Didn't Vonnegut say he didn't know where Luna was? Maybe it was Alpha.	1																					
24	24		201							1	500309		-400																					
25	25		301							1	Chrome	Yeah, he said that he "assumed Alpha was going to bring the Gray Raven Gabriel has mentioned."	1																					
26	26		301								Chrome	But I'm not sure if he was misleading us.	1																					
27	27		301								Lucia	If he really doesn't know where Luna is, it's highly likely that Alpha is nearby.	2																					
28	28		301								Lucia	Looks like we're going into the lion's den. We'd better formulate a plan of action.	2																					
29	29		301								Chrome	Good idea. When I was collecting personnel data, Camu mentioned that there was an unexplored area.	1																					
30	30		301								Chrome	Apparently, it's filled with the Red Tide and has a high Punishing concentration. Before we left, Camu said he wanted to go check it out on his own.	1																					
31	31		301								Chrome	Since Cerberus has their area covered, I think this is our best route forward.	1																					
32	32		301									Chrome points to the dotted line drawn on the terminal.																						
33	33		301								Chrome	This will allow us to traverse the entire undeployed area in the shortest distance.	1																					
34	34		302								Alright, stick to the plan.	35																						
35	35		302								Lucia, lead the way.	36

40	40		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After reaching 65% coverage, the team has only come across Hetero-Creatures lurking in the depths. There is no sign of Ascendants.																						
41	41		201							1	500166	5																						
42	42		301							1	Lucia	...This seems way too easy.	1																					
43	43		202							1					1																			
44	44		301									No Vonnegut. No Cinderelik. No sign of anyone.																						
45	45		301									If they have not already left, then they must be observing the team from the shadows.																						
46	46		301									Either way, something does not feel right.																						
47	47		301									Chrome suddenly raises his fist, signaling the group to stop.																						
48	48		201							1	500309																							
49	49		301							1	Chrome	While we've been deploying the polyfurnaces, I've noticed that the Red Tide has been flowing in one direction through the pipes.	1

51	51		201							2	500166		400

53	53		201							2	500273		400																					
54	54		301							1	Wanshi	Is it flowing toward the greenhouse?	2																					
55	55		301								Chrome	Correct.	1																					
56	56		201							2	500166	5	400																					
57	57		301							1	Lucia	You mean the Red Tide is concentrated in the greenhouse?	2																					
58	58		301								Chrome	I'm not sure. We didn't see any sign of this as we passed it.	1																					
59	59		301								Chrome	Maybe there's a secret room.	1																					
60	60		201							1	1081001		-400																					
61	61		301							1	Kamui	Think it has anything to do with Cinderelik's "Mother"?	1																					
62	62		201							1	500309		-400																					
63	63		301							1		Chrome puts his hand to the side of his head, pondering the question for a moment.																						
64	64		301								Chrome	It's highly likely. Let's go back and check out the greenhouse since we aren't picking up any interference.	1																					
65	65		301								Chrome	Maybe we can find a clue.	1																					
66	66		301								Lucia	Alright. We need to make sure there aren't any unknown Red Tide storage areas.	2																					
67	67		202							1	2				1																			
68	68		301									Seeing Lucia's serious expression, you cannot help feeling some nostalgia.																						
69	69		301									She no longer looks lost. After the recent events these past few days and gaining control over her M.I.N.D., the disturbance in her memory from transferring into Plume had gradually disappeared.																						
70	70		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				Let's go then.	71																						
71	71		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory350.jpg																								
72	72		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The group cautiously sneaks into the greenhouse. Aside from a small number of Hetero-Creatures, the room remains as it was before.																						
73	73		301									Lucia motions to Chrome, signaling for the group to split up and search for clues.																						
74	74		201							1	1081001																							
75	75		301							1	Kamui	Hey, why is there a person lying on the floor?	1																					
76	76		202							1					1																			
77	77		301									In the corner of the dark greenhouse, a Construct is curled up behind a withering plant. He appears to be unconscious.																						
78	78		201							1	500028																							
79	79		301							1	Captain Percy	Ersi! That's Ersi!	1

81	81		201							2	500273		-400																					
82	82		301							1	Wanshi	His M.I.N.D. went into shock, knocking him unconscious. His mobility mods show varying degrees of damage.	2																					
83	83		301								Wanshi	Luckily, it appears that the Hetero-Creature didn't discover him hiding in the corner.	2																					
84	84		301								Wanshi	I'll give him some emergency treatment. Continue searching for clues.	2																					
85	85		301								Captain Percy	Th-thank you!	1																					
86	86		202							1	2				1																			
87	87		301									Leaving Ersi to Wanshi, the others turn around and continue searching.																						
88	88		301									Under the specialized temperature control lights for cultivated plants, there are some rare green plants growing here.																						
89	89		201							1	500309																							
90	90		301							1	Chrome	Careful, don't touch these plants. Especially the red part.	1																					
91	91		301									Chrome reminds you quietly, seeing the plants catch your eye.																						
92	92		301								Chrome	They contain the Punishing Virus.	1																					
93	93		302								Why is something like that here?	94	Plants with the Punishing Virus?	94																				
94	94		301								Chrome	I don't know how it works, but the Punishing Virus has begun to evolve biologically. There might also be another possibility...	1																					
95	95		301									He takes out a sample kit and protective gloves to collect a sample.																						
96	96		301								Chrome	We were in a hurry last time. Now's a good time to take a sample for Asimov.	1																					
97	97		301									Right at that moment, Wanshi finally manages to resuscitate the injured Construct.																						
98	98		201							1	500028

102	102		301							1	Ersi	Captain... Where's... the commandant?	2																					
103	103		301								Captain Percy	I'm sorry... He's still missing.	1																					
104	104		301								Ersi	It's all my fault... If my intel hadn't misled the commandant, he wouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place alone.	2																					
105	105		301								Ersi	I thought I could find him, but I got trapped in this damn hornets nest...	2																					
106	106		201							1	500166	5	400																					
107	107		301							1	Lucia	Don't worry. We'll get you out of here when we locate the other Construct.	1																					
108	108		301								Lucia	Can you wait here?	1																					
109	109		301								Ersi	Um, alright...	2																					
110	110		301									He nods weakly.																						
111	111		301								Lucia	Let's keep searching.	1

113	113		201							1	1081001																							
114	114		301							1	Kamui	I've looked everywhere, but I couldn't find any switch you can flip and open up a door.	1

116	116		201							2	500273		400

119	119		201							1	500309																							
120	120		301							1		Chrome stands in the middle of the greenhouse, scanning his surroundings.																						
121	121		301								Chrome	That red tree.	1																					
122	122		301								Chrome	If the enemy wanted to stop us from finding the "entrance," I bet they'd block it with something we wouldn't want to go near.	1

124	124		201							2	500166	5	400

126	126		301								Chrome	Correct.	1																					
127	127		301								Lucia	Let's check out the tree then.	2																					
128	128		302								Stay alert. No sleeping on the job.	129	Okay.	135																				
129	129		202							1	2				1

137	137		301									After moving the box, you discover a narrow passage in the floor.																						
138	138		201							1	500309

143	143		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						As soon as the team squeezes out of the narrow passage, you are surprised and momentarily speechless at the strange scene before you.																						
144	144		301									The dim light from the sky nourishes the surrounding red trees, and root-like pipes coil around them, revealing a peaceful but strange atmosphere.																						
145	145		201							1	1081001	4																						
146	146		301							1	Kamui	Hey, could it be... that "Mother" Cinderelik mentioned?	1																					
147	2001		201							1	500301																							
148	147		301							1		Everyone looks up to where Kamui is pointing. An indescribable giant hangs from the root-like pipes in the collapsed cave. Its body undulates as if breathing while it syphons nutrients from the Red Tide delivered through a pipe.																						
149	148		201							1	500309		-400																					
150	149		201							2	500273		400																					
151	150		301							1	Wanshi	This Hetero-Creature is like a heart.	2																					
152	152		301								Chrome	Is it circulating the Red Tide rather than accumulating it?	1																					
153	153		301								Wanshi	You're partially right. By the way it's absorbing nutrients and then excreting them, I'd say it's more like digesting it.	2																					
154	154		301								Wanshi	Is that why they haven't evacuated this place?	2																					
155	155		301								Chrome	Possibly. Seems like we found out why the Red Tide is accumulating here.	1																					
156	156		201							2	500166	5	400																					
157	157		301							1	Lucia	Commandant, we don't know its specific composition. But since this is our enemy's primary objective, destroying it should be our top priority.	2																					
158	158		201							2	500273		400																					
159	159		301							1	Wanshi	I'm sensing abnormally high Punishing concentration. I think its incubating something... But it's not fully developed yet.	2																					
160	160		301								Wanshi	I agree with Lucia. We'd better destroy it, then collect samples for experts to analyze.	2																					
161	161		201							2	500166	5	400																					
162	162		301							1	Lucia	But before we do, we should secure an escape route. Someone should be guarding the door.	2																					
163	163		301								Lucia	We don't know who we're up against. If they cut off our escape route, we'll drown in the Red Tide meant to feed this monstrosity.	2																					
164	164		201							1	1081001		-400																					
165	165		301							1	Kamui	Isn't that why Asimov gave us those... Er, what are these gizmos called again?	1																					
166	166		302								Polyfurnaces.	167	The bane of our existence...	168																				
167	167	171	301								Kamui	Oh, right. Can't we just shove 'em up there and get the hell out? That way, we kill two birds with one stone!	1

169	169		301								Kamui	Hahaha! Got that right! Deploying these things is a real pain in the ***!	1

175	175		301								??	Wow, what the hell is that? I think I'm going to puke...

192	192		301								Reyna	I ran into an Ascendant with white hair, but she didn't seem interested in me. She ran off somewhere in a hurry.	1																					
193	193		301								Reyna	Oh, yeah. Ersi said he ran into a girl with half a wing. But she left after knocking him unconscious.	1
