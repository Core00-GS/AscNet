6	6		301			DialogEnable				1		Following the route Liv has mapped out, you run into a distorted Program Ghost.																						
7	7		301								Liv	How come... But the signal characteristics on it are definitely identical to "Bianca"...	1																					
8	8		301								Lee	They're probably left behind by the springboard.	2																					
9	9		301								Lee	It is distorting because "Bianca" couldn't clean up the messy departure of her invading data in time... Or maybe she never intended to clean it up for the host she hijacked.	2																					
10	10		301								Lucia	This is probably going to affect the efficiency of our tactics, but I think we should fix it.	3																					
11	11		301				DialogDisable				Lee	I would have done the same myself. If we extract the noises from the Program Ghost, we should theoretically be able to figure out the direction of the bridging route.	2
