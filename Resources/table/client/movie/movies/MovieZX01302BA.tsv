25	25		301									Your gaze follows the direction Liv points. Everyone gathers around—																						
26	26		301									—It's the sea.																						
27	27		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					—The coastline quickly zips past and beneath you, the land fading out of view. The cerulean beyond engulfs the plane's windows.

32	34		301							1	Lucia	...Whoa.																						
33	35		301									There have been missions near the sea before, but simply coming to see the sea and sea only... is indeed a first.																						
34	36		301									No wonder everyone is stunned. No one ever had the chance or leisure for sea-viewing in the past.																						
35	37		301								Liv	So pretty... It's my first time seeing the sea like this...																						
36	38		301								Lucia	Indeed... It's completely different from the grayish waters back on the Nighter...																						
37	39		301								Lee	Over 70% of Earth's surface is covered by water, so naturally, there'd be many kinds of seas.																						
38	40		302								Yeah.	41	Lee...	42																				
39	41	45	301								Lucia	Is that so...?																						
40	42		301								Lee	...What?																						
41	45		301								Liv	So! What do we do on a vacation anyways?																						
42	46		301								Liv	I don't think I've had a vacation since I became part of Babylonia.																						
43	48		302								Going on a vacation...	49																						
44	49		302								...means it's time to play!	51	...means just lazing around doing nothing!	57																				
45	51		301								Lucia	Play... What do you mean by that, Commandant?																						
46	54	60	301								Lee	Same. I require a more definite answer.																						
47	57		301								Lee	Doing nothing... We're flying all this way over to the Caribbean to do nothing?																						
48	58		301								Lee	I find it quite difficult to comprehend.																						
49	60		301									...It does seem like a brain teaser to explain the concept of fun and leisure to Constructs. After all, their purpose is to make war, not play.																						
50	61		301									But before you reach a conclusion, a sudden bright flash illuminates the porthole, drawing everyone's attention.																						
51	63		301								Kamui	Whoa! Wazzat?																						
52	65		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					A white halo above the sea surface flirts into your eyes, followed by several building outlines.

68	80		302								What's Venus Splash Park?	81	That halo?	82																				
69	81	83	301								Pilot	Supposed to be a water park built by some zaibatsu, but after the virus broke out, everything's been free real estate.																						
70	82		301								Pilot	That's the skylight corridor of the park. Some zaibatsu built this whole place, but after the virus broke out, everything's been free real estate.																						
71	83		301								Pilot	This place is the dream for a vacation. We'll be landing nearby.																						
72	84		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Pilot	You can't find an airport or a runway in this stretch, so I'll hover near the pier there. You guys can hop off there.
