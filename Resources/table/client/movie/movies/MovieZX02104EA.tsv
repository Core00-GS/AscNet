3	3		301			DialogEnable						After defeating the last Corrupted on the landing pad, Vera relaxes for a second.																						
4	4		301									But the city does not stop sinking when the last Corrupted is defeated.																						
5	5		301									There is only one possibility—the city sinking is not related to the Corrupted attack.																						
6	6		301									Vera takes a look at the design of the landing pad and the structure of the city around you.

8	8		301							1	Vera	I see. I was wondering how such a large structure on the ocean could hide so well.	1																					
9	9		301								Vera	Optical camouflage, radiation shielding, radiation-absorbent material... and a submerging mechanism? What a bunch of mad scientists.	1																					
10	10		302								Submerging mechanism... like a submarine?	11																						
11	11		301								Vera	Exactly like a submarine.	1																					
12	12		204							1	4																							
13	13		301								Vera	But what has triggered it? Is there... someone else here apart from us?	1																					
14	14		302								Survivors?	15	Enemies.	17																				
15	15		301								Vera	Has your brain turned into mush after they locked you up?	1																					
16	16	19	301								Vera	The President said the city has lost all contact with the outside world after the outbreak, which means no one has had any communication with anyone outside. There wouldn't be enough supplies to survive this long anyway.	1																					
17	17		301								Vera	Those crab-like Corrupted... should be industrial underwater mechanoids.	1																					
18	18		301								Vera	But I don't think they're smart enough to trigger the mechanism.	1																					
19	19		301								Vera	That means someone else has visited this place apart from us.	1																					
20	20		301									The sensation of being observed in secret sends a shiver up your spine.

22	22		301									Vera glances at you before stepping on the passage ahead, her red ponytail swinging across the air in a graceful curve.																						
23	23		201							1	500345	5																						
24	24		301							1	Vera	Stay close. Whoever they are, we're going to drown and die here if we don't find the entrance into the city before it fully submerges.	1																					
25	25		204							1	13																							
26	26		301								Vera	Oh, I forgot. I'm not going to die, duh. Can't promise the same for a frail human like you, 【kuroname】.	1																					
27	27		302								...	28	I'll find our objective before that happens.	30																				
28	28		204							1	4																							
29	29	32	301								Vera	Don't count on me saving your life like one of your birdies when that happens.	1																					
30	30		204							1	4																							
31	31		301								Vera	I hope you're not all talk.	1

33	33		301									No longer reacting to Vera's provocation, you turn to the seaborne city in the distance.																						
34	34		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Deep inside, you suspect that this will not be a simple and quiet investigation.
