23	23		301								Asimov	Even though I can't see you, you know you are staring, right?	1																					
24	24		301									Asimov talks while his eyes still focus on the complicated projection in front of him.

37	37		301							1	Asimov	Hush. We'll talk about that later. The source... if we can locate the source of the signal... This is a remarkable discovery...	1																					
38	38		301									Asimov holds his finger to his lips and shushes them.																						
39	39		301								Asimov	Could it be...?!	1																					
40	40		301								Asimov	...No, we're lacking some crucial data. But if we relocate the CUB, maybe we can...	1

44	44		301									But Asimov has stopped talking.																						
45	45		301								Liv	I guess Asimov is back into his researcher mode...	1

47	47		204							1	14																							
48	48		301								Liv	Okay... Lucia, I'm worried... This is the first time Commandant goes on a mission this long on Earth alone...	1																					
49	49		204							2	1																							
50	50		301								Lucia	Don't worry. Commandant knows how to be careful. Plus, with Lee, you, and me here, we'll never let anything happen to Commandant.	2																					
51	51		301								Lucia	Liv, let's focus on the task at hand. This is all we can do for now.	2

56	56		301								Lucia	Lee should have some new information. That way.	2																					
57	57		301								Liv	It's their territory after all... Maybe they'll know where Commandant has gone...	1																					
58	58		301									They look at each other, fully aware of who each other is talking about. They are about to leave the laboratory when Asimov stops them.
