3	3		301			DialogEnable						Familiar lights sway above Yoyo. She opens her eyes, violently coughing.																						
4	4		301									The long-missing air in her throat tastes like honey. Yoyo even wonders if she has forgotten how breathing feels like.																						
5	5		201							1	500442																							
6	6		301							1	???	You're finally awake...	1																					
7	7		301									The woman who has saved Yoyo twice smiles genuinely for the first time. She helps Yoyo up before feeding the girl a small cup of tea.																						
8	8		301									The warmth from the tea brings the sensation of life back to Yoyo. Her body slowly stops shaking while her tears roll down her face ceaselessly unprompted.

10	10		201							2	500448	16	400																					
11	11		301							1	Yoyo	Miss... I'm still alive... right?	2																					
12	12		301									Yoyo's voice is choking up. The woman nods and puts down the tea, hesitating for a second before holding Yoyo in her arms, allowing the girl's tears to drench her dress.																						
13	13		301									Time passes, and the night sky in the distance fades, signaling the arrival of a new day... The night of grief and tears has passed.																						
14	14		301									Yoyo wipes her tearful eyes and opens her mouth hesitantly.																						
15	15		204							2																								
16	16		301								Yoyo	I'm sorry...	2																					
17	17		301									The woman looks at the soaked spot of her dress and shakes her head, not minding the stain.																						
18	18		204							1																								
19	19		301								???	Oh, it's alright. I got this from the dance troupe. It'll be fine after a wash...	1																					
20	20		301								Yoyo	I didn't mean that... although I'm sorry about it too!	2																					
21	21		301									Yoyo blushes, scratching her head, embarrassed.																						
22	22		301								Yoyo	I should have stayed like you told me. I shouldn't have left out of spite and called you a bad person...	2																					
23	23		301								???	Perhaps... you're not wrong. It's not smart to trust someone blindly on the Nighter.	1																					
24	24		301									Then the woman takes out the panda plushie that has been staying by Yoyo's side, putting it back in the girl's arms.																						
25	25		204							1	14																							
26	26		301								???	I should apologize too... I shouldn't have told you that you'd never see your parents again. As long as you don't give up hope, there is still a chance that they'd be waiting for you in Kowloong when we return.	1																					
27	27		301								Yoyo	Okay! I won't give up, then. They must still be waiting for me...	2																					
28	28		301								???	There's something else I need to apologize for. I tried to fix the Tai'E mechanoid you bought... but its body and memory shell are both damaged beyond repair. It's impossible for it to become what it once was...	1																					
29	29		301									The woman shakes the bells in her hands, and a giant figure slowly steps inside the room out of nowhere‚Äîit is a Blubber mechanoid.

31	31		201							1	500444																							
32	32		301							1	Blubber Mechanoid	Rargh‚Äî	1																					
33	33		201							1	500442	14																						
34	34		301							1	???	So I used the parts of the Tai'E to fix up a broken Blubber. Perhaps, in a sense, it will "live" again...	1																					
35	35		301									The woman knows she is being impudent. The mechanoid that Yoyo called a "friend" no longer exists. She fears that everything she has done for the girl is in vain.																						
36	36		301								???	Every module and every screw of a mechanoid can be replaced... Does a body built with parts have a soul? What constitutes the real "soul"?	1																					
37	37		301									Yoyo reaches out tentatively, timidly touching the Blubber's metal body. It is as cold and stiff as other mechanoids‚Äîapart from the hint of pink on its wrist.																						
38	38		204							1	4																							
39	39		301								???	The ribbon was on the Tai'E mechanoid. I thought it must have meant something, so I kept it.	1																					
40	40		301									Yoyo blinks, looking at the ribbon that she once used to tie her hair, and she smiles.																						
41	41		201							1	500448	1																						
42	42		301							1	Yoyo	What... is his name?	1																					
43	43		201							1	500442	7																						
44	44		301							1	???	His name...? I... I don't know...	1																					
45	45		201							1	500448	1																						
46	46		301							1	Yoyo	Everyone needs a name. Let me give it one, then! The main character in my favorite cartoon also has a robot friend. How about I name you after him... "Uno"?	1																					
47	47		201							1	500444																							
48	48		301							1	Uno	Rargh‚Äî	1																					
49	49		201							1	500448	1																						
50	50		301							1	Yoyo	Hello, Uno, my name is Yoyo. See? We've exchanged names... but since you were just born, you'll be my little brother, and I'm your big sister, okay?	1																					
51	51		301									After seeing Uno flings its arms up and down to indicate it understands, Yoyo turns to the woman again.																						
52	52		301								Yoyo	Now, Miss, it's your turn to tell us your name!	1																					
53	53		301									Slightly surprised by Yoyo's questions, the woman shakes her head and pulls up her sleeve, revealing a crushed arm from the Blubbers' attacks‚Äîand the mechanical structures beneath her artificial skin.																						
54	54		203							1	0.25	400																						
55	55		201							2	500442	14	-400																					
56	56		301							1	???	Perhaps you have already guessed that I'm not a human... My creator didn't give me a name because I was made in secret‚Äîand I suppose there was no need to name someone who was made to be an instrument.	2																					
57	57		301									The woman's hands are as delicate as a human's, her face detailed and intricate. No one would have known her secret if it were not for her injuries.																						
58	58		301								???	I called you a valueless burden... but the truth is I am the worthless one here. I was made to fulfill my creator's biggest wish, and yet... I found out eventually that it is a duty a machine like me can never do.	2																					
59	59		204							1																								
60	60		301								Yoyo	But you're so incredible, Miss! There are things that even you can't do?	1																					
61	61		204							2	14																							
62	62		301								???	Some things can never change in this world... Some things you can never obtain.	2																					
63	63		301									She looks out the window, her gaze crossing the dawning light, landing on the top of the highest tower on the Nighter. There, his figure occasionally appears, but in his eyes, she finds not herself... nor anything on this ship.																						
64	64		204							2	4																							
65	65		301								???	I managed to board this ship as a human with this body... I couldn't explain why I disobeyed my creator's order and left Kowloong, following him onto the Nighter.	2																					
66	66		301								???	But I'll never understand humans as much as I look like one. I'll never become someone like you, Yoyo... A precious human.	2																					
67	67		301									Only half-grasping what she said, Yoyo smiles and holds the woman's hands anyway.																						
68	68		204							1	1																							
69	69		301							1	Yoyo	Values, duties... are they important? I don't actually understand... but I don't think you need to become a human, Miss! Because "if you have the component called a heart, it doesn't matter if you are human or machine!"	1																					
70	70		301								Yoyo	Isn't that cool? It might just be a line from "Kowloong's Magical Girl"... but I think it's right to say it here!	1																					
71	71		301									Yoyo holds the panda plushie she recovered in her arms, shaking her head playfully.																						
72	72		301								Yoyo	And if you lost the value that man gave you, Miss, why don't you search for your own? That must be something more precious.	1																					
73	73		301								???	My own... value? I don't know if that's... possible.	2																					
74	74		301									The woman is surprised to hear what Yoyo said. The girl's words are beyond a machine's logical parameters.																						
75	75		204							2																								
76	76		301								???	But I promise you I will try‚ÄîI will try to find my own value, to find the component called a heart...	2																					
77	77		301								Yoyo	And I will return to Kowloong, where Mom and Dad will be waiting for me like you said...	1																					
78	78		301								Yoyo	In that case, let's make a pinky swear! We swear to live together on the Nighter... until we achieve our goals.	1																					
79	79		301									Yoyo smiles, extending her pinky finger and locking the woman's pinky with hers.																						
80	80		204							2	7																							
81	81		301								???	What is this...?	2																					
82	82		301								Yoyo	That's how we make a promise... but we need your name, Miss, or it won't work!	1																					
83	83		204							2	4																							
84	84		301								???	Hmm... My creator didn't give me a name, but I have a nickname I used on this ship. I borrowed the word from a line in a song.	2																					
85	85		301								Yoyo	Then that will be your name, Miss! It belongs to you and no one else.	1																					
86	86		301									This is the first time the woman owns something precious that is hers‚Äîeven if it is only a name, it still means a lot.																						
87	87		204							2																								
88	88		301								Hanying	Hanying... My name is Hanying.	2																					
89	89		301								Yoyo	Hanying! What a pretty name, Miss!	1																					
90	90		301									Yoyo locks her pinky with Hanying's once again, moving her head from side to side rhythmically.																						
91	91		301								Yoyo	Pinky swear‚Äîpinky swear‚ÄîHanying and Yoyo swear! A promise made, a promise kept‚Äîa promise of a thousand years!	1																					
92	92		301									Looking at their locking pinkies, Hanying gives the gentlest smile.																						
93	93		301									This is the second precious thing she has gained today‚Äîa promise with a young human.																						
94	94		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Their fickle fates are now forever intertwined.
