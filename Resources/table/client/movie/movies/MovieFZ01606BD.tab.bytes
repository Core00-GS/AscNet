4	4		301								Red Tide Projection	...																						
5	5		301								Shrek	I was planning on complaining how hard it was to look for you that day. But, never mind.																						
6	6		301								Shrek	How do you feel now?																						
7	7		301								Red Tide Projection	...Cold...																						
8	8		301								Red Tide Projection	...Come, keep me company... Shrek...																						
9	9		301								Shrek	Is this what a biscuit covered in mud looks like, Bella girl?																						
10	10		301								Red Tide Projection	...																						
11	11		301								Shrek	...I've never missed bantering with you so much, Bella.																						
12	12		301								Shrek	You're no longer... you.																						
13	13		301								Shrek	Farewell, illusion created by the Red Tide.																						
14	14		301									He waves his hand, then carefully puts the book that Bella gave him into the inner slot of his backpack and prepares to leave.																						
15	15		301								Red Tide Projection	...Shrek... You will live.																						
16	16		301								Red Tide Projection	Let me explore... the unknown.																						
17	17		301								Shrek	?!																						
18	18		301								Red Tide Projection	Farewell.																						
19	19		301								Shrek	...Hey.																						
20	20		301									Trembling, he walks a few steps forward and reaches out a hand to touch the projection that reminds him of Bella.																						
21	21		301									Even though he is wearing a full set of protective gear, the infection quickly spreads from Shrek's fingertips toward the rest of his body.																						
22	22		301								Shrek	...Farewell, Bella.																						
23	23		301									He absentmindedly withdraws his hand and takes a step back.																						
24	24		301								Shrek	...Farewell.																						
25	25		301									Shrek silently repeats this word in his mind. He takes a few more wobbly steps back and gazes at the Red Tide projection from a distance.																						
26	26		301								Shrek	...Farewell. Farewell...																						
27	27		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					He says it over and over again as if trying to convince himself. By nightfall, the Red Tide projection has retreated underground with the Red Tide itself.

31	31		301									Gazing at the empty street, Shrek reaches out a hand toward the receding Red Tide. Eventually, his hand drops down.																						
32	32		301								Shrek	...	1																					
33	33		301									He staggers a few steps forward then turns around and sees the words that Bella painted on the wall.																						
34	34		301									"Earth has been stricken with innumerable disasters, and time has washed every one of them away. Live for tomorrow, because all will pass."																						
35	35		301								Shrek	...Yeah... Disasters will pass, no matter what they are.	1																					
36	36		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					With a self-mocking smile he writes another line under the quote.

40	40		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					There has never been an endless winter on this planet, but when spring comes and the ice melts away, you won't be there to see it with me.

42	42		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After he writes that line, he stands still in front of it for a long time, but eventually takes out the dagger and scratches off everything after "Of course."

44	44		301							1	Shrek	I should keep the quote the way it is. Even if it's a placebo, it'll encourage someone at some point.	1																					
45	45		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Shrek gives himself a shot of serum then picks up his heavy backpack and continues the journey... alone.
