11	10		301								Vera	Oh, Lee, my dear, how have you been?	1																					
12	11		301								Lee	I must thank you. After leaving Kurono and joining Gray Raven, my faith in humanity was restored.	2																					
13	12		301								Vera	Oh, you're as sweet as ever.	1																					
14	13		204							2	10																							
15	14		301								Lee	I choose my words depending on the person. And for you, I'd prefer brevity.	2

17	16		301								Lee	Let's not waste time, what do you want?	2																					
18	17		301								Vera	Oh, ahaha, you're still so volatile, alright‚Äî	1																					
19	18		301								Vera	I'm sure you've all noticed that signal from the Construct Tifa, yes?	1																					
20	19		301								Vera	Let me tell you a little something. This Tifa is our target this time, the "Iron Maiden".	1																					
21	20		204							2	10																							
22	21		301								Lee	Oh, I couldn't have guessed.	2																					
23	22		204							2																								
24	23		301								Vera	No, I mean that‚Äîshe is "our" target.	1																					
25	24		301								Lee	What?	2																					
26	25		301								Vera	Oh my? Your commandant looks quite interesting, can we have a little chat, hmm?	1																					
27	26		204							2	10																							
28	27		301								Lee	Nice try. I knew it. Speaking with you is a waste of time. And you haven't even answered my question.	2																					
29	28		204							2																								
30	29		301								Vera	That's not important though, is it? Cerberus never shares its treats with others.	1																					
31	30		301								Lee	So you're not going to cooperate.	2																					
32	31		301								Vera	Or more precisely, disrupt.	1																					
33	32		301								Lee	Let me get this clear, Vera. If the Iso-Devices aren't deployed as planned, the target may escape. Don't drag us all down because of your own selfishness.	2																					
34	33		301								Vera	Oh, my child, that? It's already sorted.	1																					
35	34		301								Lee	What?	2																					
36	35		301								Vera	Well, that's all. You can continue playing with those little toys of yours, tata‚Äî	1

41	40		301							1	Lucia	That Vera, who is she...?	1																					
42	41		201							1	1011001																							
43	42		301							1	Lee	She was one of the formal members of Kurono Ops. Later became the leader of Cerberus, part of the Task Force. She only recruits members coming from Kurono into her team.	1																					
44	43		301								Lee	Even in the Task Force, they're still a special team directly under the jurisdiction of Commander Nikola.	1																					
45	44		301								Lee	There's a brutal filtering system inside Kurono. The members inside would do anything to achieve their goals.	1																					
46	45		301								Lee	Coldblooded and thirsty for merits. That's their usual method of operation. They aren't well-liked because of that.	1																					
47	46		204							1	10																							
48	47		301								Lee	But of course, they are indeed capable to stand up to their name...	1

52	51		301							1	Liv	That sounds completely unlike the place I was stationed in before.	1																					
53	52		301								Lucia	Cerberus has their own objectives, Gray Raven does too.	2																					
54	53		301								Lucia	Let's continue with our mission. As for them, we'll react and adapt accordingly.	2																					
55	54		301								Lucia	Not to mention that, Cerberus isn't the only squad we can work with.	2																					
56	55		301								Liv	Yes, with the enemies nearby being cleared. We can begin our preparations as well.	1

59	58		301								Lucia	Then we shall start here and continue extending the Iso-Device coverage until it links up with the other squads'.	2
