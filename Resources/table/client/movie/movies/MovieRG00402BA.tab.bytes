7	7		301							1	Lee	There aren't as many as before. New Murmansk should become safer now that Amberia has been silenced.	2																					
8	8		301								Lee	Speaking of, Commandant. You and Rosetta completed the mission together, huh. We were doing data collection for Lucia at the time.	2

33	33		301							1	Liv	Oh, it's nothing. It just makes me kinda... sad.	1																					
34	34		301								Liv	Humanity brought about the tragedy of Amberia, and we're here to protect humanity...	1																					
35	35		301									Liv looks at you blankly. Liv's Levi-Guns seem a little wobbly in the air.
