9	4		301							1	Lucia	Looks like there's an emergency mission.	1																					
10	5		301								Liv	Everyone's on edge. Hopefully, the mission isn't too serious.	3																					
11	6		301								Lee	Don't worry, they've got skilled combatants with them. Though, back on our case, Commandant, we still have a round of data collection for Lucia's frame coming up, right?	2																					
12	7		302								Yeah.	8	Data collection?	10																				
13	8	9	301								Lucia	I wonder how we'll go about the data collection.	1																					
14	9	1004	301								Lucia	...It'll be nice if we can figure out why my frame isn't operating at its full capacity.	1																					
15	10	11	301								Lee	Commandant... You saw the transmission, right?	2																					
16	11	5000	301								Lee	Because the actual performance of Lucia's new frame wasn't quite up to par, the higher-ups want us to participate in a series of data collection to see what's wrong.	2																					
17	5000	12	204							1	1																							
18	12	1004	301								Lucia	That's what the data collection is about, Commandant.	1

21	13		301							1	Rosetta	Gray Raven. Good to see you here.	1																					
22	14		301									Suddenly, an unexpected figure walks out of the bustling squads. Her expression is ice-cold—just like when you first met in the Arctic.																						
23	1006		302								Rosetta?	15	Do you need us for anything?	16																				
24	15	1007	301								Rosetta	Why the surprised expression...? Well, I guess it is my first time speaking to you in Babylonia.	1																					
25	16	1007	301								Rosetta	You're just as calm as ever, but at least that's reassuring.	1																					
26	1007		204							1	4																							
27	17		301								Rosetta	Nikola, Gray Raven's commandant can take the last spot. Report over and out.	1																					
28	18		301									She seems to have been connected to Commander Nikola all this time. You feel a hint of what she is saying, but you are unsure as to why she did so.

31	19		301							1	Liv	Rosetta, I know you must have a mission, but we need to collect data. I don't think we'd be able to help you out...	2																					
32	20		301								Rosetta	It's okay. It won't affect you. I'm just missing a commandant.	1																					
33	1010		201							2	500166		400																					
34	21		301							1	Lucia	Huh...?	2																					
35	22		301								Rosetta	ARU seems to be under attack and has requested reinforcements. I need to bring troops over from Babylonia ASAP.	1																					
36	23		301								Lucia	Is it the Ascendants?	2																					
37	24		301								Rosetta	I can't say for sure... But I need to borrow your commandant and get back to the ARU. There's no time to spare.	1																					
38	25		301								Lucia	But, going there with just Commandant...	2																					
39	26		301								Rosetta	I won't let your commandant come to any harm. You have my word.	1																					
40	27		301								Lucia	...	2																					
41	28		301								Rosetta	...	1																					
42	29		301								Lucia	If that's the case... What do you think, Commandant?	2																					
43	1011		302								I'll go to the ARU.	30	I don't think HQ will give me a choice.	3000																				
44	30	1012	301								Lucia	If you say so, Commandant. Rosetta, please keep Commandant safe.	2																					
45	3000	31	204							1	1																							
46	31	1012	301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Rosetta	I'm sorry, but there is no way. Rest assured, I will keep you safe.	1

51	33		301									You hear fighting nearby, sending a chill down your spine.																						
52	1016		201							1	500214																							
53	36		301							1	Rosetta	I won't let you get any closer!	1																					
54	37		301			RImgBg1Shake						Holding a spear, Rosetta confronts the group of hostile bionic machines. They continue their reckless assault heedlessly.																						
55	38		301								Rosetta	Great. You're awake.	1																					
56	1017		302								What's the situation now?	39	Are you okay?	40																				
57	39	41	301								Rosetta	It's up in the air... Or actually, I think it's bordering a bit on the bad side. I wasn't expecting to run into these bionics this quickly.	1																					
58	40	41	301								Rosetta	I think you should be more concerned about yourself. You've been asleep in the snow for over half an hour.	1																					
59	41		301								Rosetta	Anyway, it's about over. I'm going to charge ahead!	1

61	1019		401							2	10002001																							
62	42		301									Rosetta throws her spear, penetrating the enemies like a shooting star. While the enemies are distracted, she jumps into the air and unleashes her shield.																						
63	1020		201							1	500214																							
64	43		301							1	Rosetta	Ready, aim—	1																					
65	44		301								Rosetta	—Fire!	1

68	45		301			RImgBg1Shake						A burst of energy erupts from her shield and rains down on the enemy bionics.

70	46		301							1	Bionic Machine	—Retreat!	1																					
71	1024		202							1																								
72	47		301									The bionics at the rear make a split decision to abandon their fallen comrades and retreat out of the battlefield.																						
73	1025		201							1	500214	8																						
74	48		301							1	Rosetta	Hmph... Just my lucky day.	1																					
75	49		301									Once Rosetta confirms the enemy's retreat, she lowers the output of her light wings and descends from the sky, retrieving her spear impaled in the ground.																						
76	1026		204							1	4																							
77	50		301							1	Rosetta	Alright, 【kuroname】. Let's continue our mission.	1																					
78	1027		302								Our mission?	51	What is this place?	52																				
79	51	53	301								Rosetta	...Are you messing with me? Or do you not care to remember these sorts of things?	1																					
80	52	53	301								Rosetta	We are within Arctic Route Union's jurisdiction. Did the impact just now give you brain damage or something...?	1																					
81	53		301								Rosetta	At any rate—	1																					
82	54		301								Rosetta	I didn't expect the transport craft to be shot down by anti-aircraft guns and crash into the snow... Just my lucky day...	1																					
83	1029		201							1	500208																							
84	55		301							1	Bionic Machine	ROAR!!!	1																					
85	56		301									Just as you are about to inquire about the next course of action, a group of bionics suddenly charge out from where they evacuated. Looks like they were retreating to rally reinforcements.																						
86	2444		201							1	500214	8																						
87	57		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Rosetta	Looks like now's not the time to talk... 【kuroname】, no... Commandant, join me in battle!	1
