4	4		301			DialogEnable						After leaving her two teammates, Lucia rushed to the destination as fast as possible, but all that remained was a sea of wreckage, with no sign of survivors.

7	7		301							1	Lucia	...Commandant! Where are you...	1																					
8	8		504							0.8																								
9	9		301									No matter how many times Lucia requested a response in her comms, there was no reply from the commandant. Lucia began to feel uneasy.																						
10	10		301								Lucia	Is it because of what happened?	1

13	13		201							1	500013																							
14	14		301							1	Corrupted	Rargh!!!!!	1																					
15	15		301									A corrupted suddenly emerged from a corner of the ruins, its sharp claws almost cut into the distracted Lucia.																						
16	16		504							0.5																								
17	17		201							1	1021001																							
18	18		301							1	Lucia	Gasp‚Äîa Corrupted?!	1																					
19	19		301									More than one, it turned out. A swarm of Corrupted began to head toward Lucia from all directions.																						
20	20		504							0																								
21	21		301								Lucia	Why... Hiro should've led them away! Unless he's already...	1																					
22	22		301									Lucia tried to connect with Hiro while taking down the Corrupted around her, only to find his communication channel blocked, leaving behind the chilling audio of the system prompt.																						
23	23		401							2	1508																							
24	24		201							1	500013																							
25	25		301							1	Corrupted	Rargh!!!!!	1																					
26	26		301									More and more Corrupted were lured by the sound of battle. It was not the time to speculate.																						
27	27		201							1	1021001																							
28	28		301							1	Lucia	I have to get out of here and find Hiro and Commandant‚Äîthey must be worried about me!	1																					
29	29		401							2	1510																							
30	30		301									And then she heard a gunshot coming from somewhere ahead.																						
31	31		204							1	3																							
32	32		301								Lucia	Could that be the mysterious foe?! Or... is it Commandant and the others?	1																					
33	33		301									Having lost all contacts, the only way she could confirm was by approaching the gunshot. A deadly fight seemed inevitable.																						
34	34		301								Lucia	Why...	1																					
35	35		202							1					1																			
36	36		301									As she ran, Lucia grabbed ahold of her trembling right hand. She was never afraid of a fight, but right now she had a terrible feeling in her guts.																						
37	37		301									The expected brawl did not happen. What awaited Lucia when she arrived was a fallen Construct Soldier equipped with a short-range jet pack‚Äîbut he could no longer fly.																						
38	38		201							1	1021001	3																						
39	39		301							1	Lucia	...Hiro!	1																					
40	40		301									Lucia helped the still-breathing Hiro up, only to discover his Inver-Device had been damaged by a gunshot, similar to what happened to Murol and Xun.																						
41	41		301								Lucia	What happened... And the commandant‚Äîwhere is Commandant?!	1																					
42	42		201							1	500028																							
43	43		301							1	Hiro	Hah, Lucia... you're still alive...	1																					
44	44		202							1					1																			
45	45		301								???	Hiro... and Lucia, why won't you just die?!																						
46	46		401							2	1510																							
47	47		301									A shot from behind pierced Lucia's leg, and her vital fluid spilled all over the collapsed bricks and rocks.																						
48	48		401							1	211																							
49	49		301									Lucia immediately turned to where the shot came from and shielded herself with her blade from another attack‚Äîonly to find the gun-bearing commandant standing there.																						
50	50		201							1	500028																							
51	51		301							1	Hiro	Commandant... No‚ÄîRavenge! You lying piece of crap...	1																					
52	52		301								Ravenge	Don't blame me for your stupidity... And Lucia's still alive, so you haven't even held on to your end of the bargain.																						
53	53		301								Hiro	You said that if I led them to the enhanced Riot and lured the Corrupted there, the people in Babylonia will let my daughter go... But it's all a lie!	1																					
54	54		201							1	1021001	3																						
55	55		301							1	Lucia	Hiro... What are you saying? You... were the one who brought the Corrupted to us?	1																					
56	56		301									Hiro turned away, unable to look Lucia in the eye.																						
57	57		202							1					1																			
58	58		301								Ravenge	No rush, Lucia... You'll be next.																						
59	59		201							1	500028																							
60	60		301							1	Hiro	Bastard... It won't end well for you!	1																					
61	61		301								Ravenge	Oh? Weren't you the one who started it?																						
62	62		301								Hiro	It was a coincidence that I ran into the infected... "Construct" who maintained self-awareness...	1																					
63	63		301									He paused for a second when he said the word "Construct", as if he could not find a proper term to call that unique being.																						
64	64		301								Hiro	I wouldn't have said anything if you weren't threatening my daughter!	1																					
65	65		301								Ravenge	He is an Ascendant. That's what he told me.																						
66	66		301								Hiro	Ha... Fine. You said you were bringing an army to defeat this Ascendant, but you're just here to connect to him!	1																					
67	67		301								Hiro	How could you override something like that?! The lives we've lost... all because your mind was corrupted, causing the Ascendant to go berserk!	1																					
68	68		301									As Hiro cried out, Lucia recalled the horrifying scene a few hours ago. No one survived.																						
69	69		301								Hiro	Had we not protected you, you would have‚Äî	1																					
70	70		301									Hiro thumped the ground with his fist in anguish. The frantic motions created a few more tears on his scarred body.																						
71	71		201							1	1021001	3																						
72	72		301							1	Lucia	Commandant... You said you would take responsibility when we were heading back. But now you're...	1																					
73	73		202							1					1																			
74	74		301								Ravenge	No one will know if you're all dead.																						
75	75		301								Ravenge	As the only survivor, I'll get to be the commandant of the next Gray Raven, and you'll get a medal for your courageous sacrifices from protecting me. Doesn't that sound nice?																						
76	76		301									Ravenge grinned as he raised his gun toward Hiro. Lucia, however, stepped in front of him.																						
77	77		201							1	1021001	4	-400																					
78	78		201							2	500028		400																					
79	79		301							1	Hiro	Lucia...	2																					
80	80		301								Lucia	Commandant! We're here to destroy the Corrupted to reclaim Earth! That is the dream every Gray Raven shares‚ÄîI can understand why you'd want to become more powerful in order to achieve this dream.	1																					
81	81		301								Lucia	But there have been too many sacrifices! You have to stop making the same mistake!	1																					
82	82		301									In the face of Lucia's challenge, Ravenge laughed instead.																						
83	83		301								Ravenge	(Laughed) True... It was my judgment that led to this slaughter.																						
84	84		301								Ravenge	And if you're all dead, I'll be able to blame it on the enemies, and I'll come out of this guilt-free!																						
85	85		301									Hysterically he laughed, lowering his gun.																						
86	86		301								Lucia	Commandant, there are still traces of corruption in your mind. Please return to the base with us now!	1																					
87	87		301								Ravenge	Corrupted? I'm not corrupted‚ÄîI'm enlightened.																						
88	88		301								Ravenge	The reason we failed this time is that we brought too few soldiers, you useless trash! That's why we couldn't take down the Ascendant!																						
89	89		301								Hiro	The reason we failed is you! If you hadn't made the unauthorized connection, so many more of us would have survived!	2																					
90	90		301								Hiro	So many of us believed in the future when Earth belongs to humans once again, and look where it's led us.	2																					
91	91		301								Ravenge	Do you still believe in that? I'd love to kill all the Corrupted as well, but that's impossible! The only future humans have is the one shared with the Ascendants, who control the Punishing Virus!																						
92	92		301									Ravenge's movement was barely noticeable before he aimed and fired at Lucia's Inver-Device. She was prepared this time, however, and blocked it with her blade.																						
93	93		301								Ravenge	Sigh, Lucia, you being so powerful really is a pain in the neck. Luckily your Inver-Device is still connected with me, and there are a million ways to corrupt a Construct.																						
94	94		301									All of a sudden, Lucia's Inver-Device issued a warning‚ÄîRavenge had lowered its defense with his commandant access. The immediate assault to her M.I.N.D. caused Lucia a great amount of pain.																						
95	95		204							1	9																							
96	96		301			PanelActor1Shake				1	Lucia	AAAAGGHHH!	1																					
97	97		202							1	2				1																			
98	98		301								Ravenge	Poor thing. Had you died in the hands of Riot, you wouldn't have to suffer this much...																						
99	99		301									Ravenge slowly approached her and aimed with his pistol‚Äîbut the moment he tried to pull the trigger, a crimson light flashed by.																						
100	100		401							2	10002001																							
101	101		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiHitNew.prefab	2																							
102	102		301								Ravenge	Huh?																						
103	103		301									His robotic arm was severed cleanly and flew into the air‚Äîeven the fingers were right where the trigger was.																						
104	104		301								Ravenge	AHHHH! Why?! Why can you still move, Lucia?!																						
105	105		201							1	1021001	9																						
106	106		301							1	Lucia	I'm... used to this kind of pain!	1																					
107	107		301									Even though the Punishing Virus was still hurting her gravely, Lucia's sword-wielding hand had stopped shaking.																						
108	108		202							1					1																			
109	109		301								Ravenge	Don't you think that you can defy me! I've already sent the news of your deaths, and soon you'll become Corrupted yourselves. You'll never return to Babylonia!																						
110	110		401							2	1513																							
111	111		301									Ravenge ran away, clutching his injured left arm. A horde of Corrupted had surrounded the area after noticing the commotion.																						
112	112		201							1	500028
