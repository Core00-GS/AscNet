4	4		301									You don't know which one of you said that first, but it's over.																						
5	5		301									The whole city lies in shambles, with buildings wrecked and roads clustered with debris. To make matters worse, the spread of the Punishing Virus has sealed off even more of Kowloong.																						
6	6		301									The Ascendants are gone. The rebuilt defense lines are keeping the Corrupted at bay. Soon the city will return to peace‚Äîor at least, that is what everyone believes.																						
7	7		301									Relieved, some teams let themselves collapse to the ground, enjoying this moment of respite.

11	9		301									The Kowloongers no longer bother with removing the outsiders, nor do they give thanks. They merely give them cursory glances before returning to their designated positions, unspoken words in their voice modules.																						
12	10		301									Some distance away, the reinforcing factions, who played key roles in turning the tide of this battle, are resting. Despite the victory, not a trace of joy decorates their faces.																						
13	11		301				DialogDisable					A liaison officer scurries over with panic on his face. He seems to have something important to say.

16	12		301			DialogEnable					Lucia	It's about Gestalt, right?																						
17	102		302								Yes.	13	Are you alright, Lucia?	14																				
18	13	15	301								Lucia	That must be something very important...																						
19	14	15	301								Lucia	I'm fine...																						
20	15		301									Huaxu was taken by the Ascendants in the end. That is why they all have that grim look on their faces.																						
21	16		301									What will happen to Babylonia? What will the Ascendants do with Huaxu? These are the questions that all hang on everyone's mind.																						
22	17		301								Lucia	Commandant... Perhaps... we could have done it better, right?																						
23	103		302								Perhaps.	18	We all gave it our best.	19																				
24	18	20	301								Lucia	But... I have no regrets.																						
25	19	20	301								Lucia	Mh-hm, I guess... That just wasn't enough.																						
26	20		301								Lucia	Commandant...																						
27	21		301									When the team retreated here with Lucia, she regained some of her consciousness. Lee and Liv made her sit and lean on your back.																						
28	22		301									Unable to move, she gazes ahead with wistful eyes.																						
29	23		301								Lucia	At least... I'm okay with the result. What more? The battle's over. And I get to lean on your back like this.																						
30	24		301								Lucia	...But still, I'm afraid.																						
31	25		301								Lucia	I'm afraid... I don't know how long it'll be, before I'm "myself" again.																						
32	27		301								Lucia	...Commandant, can I call you by your name?																						
33	104		302								Sure.	28	Why?	29																				
34	28		301								Lucia	„Äêkuroname„Äë...																						
35	300		301								Lucia	„Äêkuroname„Äë, „Äêkuroname„Äë...																						
36	301	30	301								Lucia	„Äêkuroname„Äë.																						
37	29		301								Lucia	It eases me...																						
38	302		301								Lucia	„Äêkuroname„Äë...																						
39	303	30	301								Lucia	„Äêkuroname„Äë.																						
40	30		301									Lucia chants your name, toying with the pitch, the tone, the speed, as if finding a new piece of treasure.																						
41	31		301								Lucia	You must find this weird. But it's a spell that makes me not afraid.																						
42	32		301									After that, Lucia leans closer as if she is about to hand herself over to you. She pours her heart out.																						
43	33		301								Lucia	Commandant, what do you think the next Lucia is going to be like? Will she be as stubborn as she's now, or be as shy as Liv?																						
44	34		301								Lucia	If I get to choose, it might be nice being like Ayla or Karenina, someone frank, straightforward, and outspoken.																						
45	35		301								Lucia	Or someone like Bianca, who has the poise to perfectly lead a squad.																						
46	36		301								Lucia	Or even Nanami, or Sophia...? But they are kinda two ends of the extremes, so... I guess, maybe not.																						
47	37		301									She thinks out loud in a brisk voice, acting like some vivacious girl untouched by any disaster.																						
48	38		301									Innocent, cheerful, and full of hope for tomorrow.																						
49	39		301									If the Punishing Virus never existed, is this what Lucia would have been like? No one knows. No one can answer.																						
50	40		301									Because there are no "what-ifs" in life. Reality is set in stone.																						
51	500		301								Lucia	But... I know everything's going to be fine. Because you are here.																						
52	501		301								Lucia	And this time... I finally have memories, truly mine, within my M.I.N.D.																						
53	502		301								Lucia	By the time I get to know the next me and prove her worth, you will see a better Lucia.																						
54	203		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cg1201_6.jpg																								
55	41		301								Lucia	...Well then, see you soon, Commandant.																						
56	42		301									She whispers, ready to part with those words.																						
57	105		302								See you soon, Lucia.	43																						
58	43		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Mh-hm.
