3	2		301				DialogEnable					Like a prisoner who just broke out of a prison in the desert, the sun shines madly on the dunes. The air is filled with scorching heat and dry dust.																						
4	3		301									Watanabe walks on yellow sand. Summer wind quickly blasts over the sand, bringing salty air from some unknown distant sea and the smell of gasoline from abandoned factories before disappearing again into the horizon.																						
5	4		301									He smells gun smoke, which is then quickly erased by the dry summer wind.																						
6	5		301									He stands in the vast desert.																						
7	6		301									Watanabe has never felt so calm, even when his Inver-Device is screaming about the high-concentration of Punishing Virus in the air.																						
8	7		301								Watanabe	Hah, leave me alone. I don't often get to enjoy the afternoon like this.																						
9	8		301									Watanabe reaches out for the Inver-Device in his hair. The sharp tip feels like the bones of some deep-sea animalâ€”hard, but fragile.																						
10	9		301									Watanabe clenches the Inver-Device tightly. With his teeth gnashed, he breaks it with great force.																						
11	10		301								Watanabe	Ugh... Argh...																						
12	11		301									As Watanabe forces his way out of the controlled network of Babylonia, he could no longer turn off his pain reception.																						
13	12		301									But he didn't plan to do so anyway. Even when he was back in Babylonia, sometimes, only the pain could remind him that he was alive.																						
14	13		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Pain helps him remember many things. A valuable lesson from his instructor.

16	15		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Watanabe	Um...																						
17	16		301									Enduring the pain and forcibly removing his Inver-Device, Watanabe wipes away the vital fluid flowing down from the wound on his forehead.																						
18	17		301								Watanabe	Hmph.																						
19	18		301								Watanabe	I don't need this kind of collar anymore.																						
20	19		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The Inver-Device covered with vital fluid rests in the palm of Watanabe's hand. He clenches his fist then his relaxes hand, causing the device to fall between his fingers.

22	21		301		1	AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin					Seemingly oblivious to it, Watanabe quietly and resolutely walks in the direction of the "Oasis".
