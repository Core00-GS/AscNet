30	30		301								Lee	The Memory Inductive Neural Depository, or M.I.N.D. system of us Constructs function in a vastly different way than the logic circuits of mechs and androids—	3																					
31	31		301								Lee	Which means it is extremely difficult to disrupt a specific target.	3																					
32	32		301								Lee	So unless they have a far more superior grasp of M.I.N.D. tech than the scientists back at Babylonia, it is impossible to specifically target someone.	3

75	74		301								Lee	Looks like you're right. It's a primitive trap, but we fell right in it since we need supplies so badly... Should we keep going, Commandant?	3																					
76	75		302								Search more thoroughly for friendly signals.	76	Immediately leave to avoid being besieged.	83

99	98		204							3																								
100	99		301								Lee	A Construct's memory is unique just like a human's. However, Constructs can initiate a long-range recall just before their frame is destroyed.	3																					
101	100		301								Lee	Though this would heavily deviate their M.I.N.D. thought model from the standard humanity thought model, it is still preferable to complete annihilation.	3																					
102	101		204							3	10																							
103	102		301								Lee	If their M.I.N.D. is destroyed before they recall, then their memory will be completely destroyed.	3
