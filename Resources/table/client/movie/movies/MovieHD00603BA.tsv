10	10		301									As if realizing that the phrases formed with their standard voice library are useless in overcoming the other side, the voices rising from the confronting camps gradually die down.																						
11	11		301									Instead, the crowd of mechanoids at the front begins to divide into smaller groups.

22	22		301									However, the four small red mechanoids responsible for the attack are immediately torn to pieces by the blue mechanoid reinforcements.																						
23	23		301									The formations come together, then spread apart slightly. A larger mechanoid standing among the two factions issues an unintelligible command, causing the formations to merge once more.																						
24	24		301									Among the mass of red and blue mechanoids, a chaotic flurry of fragmented armor flies out from the crowded mass.
