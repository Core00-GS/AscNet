6	6		301			DialogEnable						Snow is coming down hard where the memory ends.																						
7	7		301									Right before his mind melts into the snowfield and turns blank... Noan has a dream.																						
8	8		301									In that dream, he is the only person who dies, lying alone in the snow. Everyone else is safe and sound, living aboard Asslam.																						
9	9		301									After his consciousness fades away, he has an agonizing nightmare.																						
10	10		301									In that nightmare, he survived the fall from the speeding train, saved by a Construct.																						
11	11		301									A mechanical firefly his friend gave him blocked the gunshot to his chest, saving him from a lethal wound.																						
12	12		301									He keeps crawling on the frozen field, accompanied only by his pain and the realization that everyone he cares about has perished this winter.																						
13	13		301									—Do you regret it?																						
14	14		301									The distant voice echoes by his ear once more through his memories.																						
15	15		301									—Would you have given that "evidence" away if you could choose again?																						
16	16		301								Noan	...																						
17	17		301									—Why the silence? Has your mind been assimilated by the memories of you dying?																						
18	18		301									The voice sighs mournfully.																						
19	19		301									—Hey. When I left Medical Center 09 to find you, I left some "gifts" behind on your behalf for those who rejected Ascendants.

38	38		301									If Lithos was telling the truth, then Medical Center 09 must be in great danger right now.
