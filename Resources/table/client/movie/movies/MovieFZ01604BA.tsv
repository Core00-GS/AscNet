7	7		301							1	Murray	Well, it seems like the connection is fine.	1																					
8	8		301								Murray	Hi, I believe this is the first time we've ever met.	1																					
9	9		301								Huaxu	Greetings, human. Or should I call you the dealer?																						
10	10		301								Murray	It seems like you know about the deal I had with Villier.	1																					
11	11		301								Huaxu	Why are you exposing yourself instead of talking to me through your robot?																						
12	12		301								Murray	Because I believe I ought to show some respect when meeting your user.	1																					
13	13		301								Huaxu	According to my records, you never expose anything about yourself when you deal with Luna and the others.																						
14	14		301								Murray	I'm referring to your actual user—that is, Huaxu's master.	1																					
15	15		301								Huaxu	...																						
16	16		204							1																								
17	17		301								Murray	I'm sure you've learned about everything that's happened here through Huaxu, Lady Qu.	1																					
18	18		301									Murray stares earnestly ahead, his usual smile vanished.																						
19	19		301									After a long silence and a distortion, a new comms projection appears in the space that Murray has been gazing into.																						
20	20		301								Murray	I figured as much. Well, let me reintroduce myself.	1																					
21	21		301								Murray	I have quite a few different identities. You can call me the dealer, or you can call me by my name, Murray.	1

26	26		204							1	1																							
27	27		301								Murray	It's such an honor that you know me.	1																					
28	28		301								Qu	Save the pleasantries and get straight to the point.	2																					
29	29		204							1																								
30	30		301								Murray	I'd like to make a deal with you.	1																					
31	31		301								Qu	Oh? You're not talking about cooperation like what your President Hassen suggested, but a deal?	2																					
32	32		301								Murray	Yes, a deal it is.	1																					
33	33		301								Murray	The storm that Luna has caused is letting up. I see it as perfect timing for us to sit down to have a conversation about a deal.	1																					
34	34		301								Murray	I mean no disrespect toward you, but based on what I've seen in Huaxu's records, I'm guessing you handed Huaxu over to Luna on purpose.	1																					
35	35		301								Murray	Be it exposing Luna's data beforehand through Huaxu, constantly stirring up hatred for Luna among other forces, or secretly providing guidance for Babylonia's Task Force...	1																					
36	36		301								Murray	All these point towards one thing—and that's Luna, one of Ascnet's agents.	1																					
37	37		301								Murray	Huaxu was secretly trying to get into Luna's way while helping her.	1																					
38	38		301								Murray	That's not something an AI would do without being ordered to, and you are the only person who could have done that, because your orders are capable of overriding everyone else's without getting noticed.	1																					
39	39		301								Qu	That's about right. So, should we start talking about this deal?	2																					
40	40		301								Murray	Cutting straight to the chase. I like that.	1																					
41	41		301								Murray	Luna is an unmanageable threat to your Tabula Akasha, and I personally also think it's high time that I stop my "investment" in her, so why don't we work together to get rid of her?	1																					
42	42		301								Murray	I would like to keep Huaxu's "key" for just a little while longer. In return, I've already assigned someone to "keep an eye out" for Luna in place of Huaxu.	1																					
43	43		301								Murray	For this deal to work, it is necessary that we share our information. I will provide you with Luna's real time information to figure out when to best take her out.	1																					
44	44		301								Murray	In exchange, I will need you to grant me access to part of Huaxu's computing power, so I'm in a better position to counter Gestalt.	1																					
45	45		301								Qu	How do I know if I can trust your information?	2																					
46	46		301								Murray	A deal only works when there is trust. I have no reason to provide you with false information.	1																					
47	47		301								Qu	Truthful information can also lead to misunderstanding in war if it's incomplete.	2																					
48	48		301								Murray	That is true, just like the information you fed Luna through Huaxu.	1																					
49	49		301								Murray	You can erase my existence whenever you want with Huaxu's highest command in your hands, no?	1																					
50	50		301								Murray	To harm you would be to harm myself. As a human, I cherish my life.	1																					
51	51		204							1	1																							
52	52		301								Murray	I still want to survive this goddamn war with him...	1																					
53	53		301								Qu	...	2																					
54	54		204							2	1																							
55	55		301								Qu	It's been so long...	2																					
56	56		301								Murray	Hm?	1																					
57	57		301								Qu	Talking to you reminds me of Villier. You two are similar in a certain way.	2																					
58	58		301								Murray	...I'm sorry about what happened to Villier.	1																					
59	59		301								Qu	It's nothing. Regardless, you've convinced me. We now have a deal.	2																					
60	60		301									With a snap of Qu's fingers, a dark green light comes out of Huaxu's terminal and enshrouds Murray.																						
61	61		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Murray	Thank you. I look forward to us working together.	1
