7	7		301								Kamui	If we help you get the hidden data inside this disc, will WGAA reward us for it?	2																					
8	8		301								Ayla	First of all, at least you all had some fun while Babylonia was baking in the deadly heat.	1																					
9	9		301								Ayla	As for the reward, I can give you the public access key to the first two levels of the Golden Age database's video game section.	1																					
10	10		301								Kamui	Public access?	2																					
11	11		301								Ayla	There was never a "regular" access key, because Allen thought it wasn't necessary.	1																					
12	12		301								Kamui	...Deal.	2																					
13	13		301								Ayla	What do you say, Gray Raven?	1

19	18		301								Liv	At least... We have something to do?	2																					
20	19		301								Lee	We have already come this far. At least I want to figure out what it is before breaking it apart.	3																					
21	20		201							2	500110	1																						
22	21		301							1	Ayla	So I take it as you all have no problem. Is that right?	2

26	25		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Narration	Once again, you wake up from darkness.																						
27	26		301								Narration	There is neither confrontation like The Darkening, nor being trapped like The White Owl.																						
28	27		301								Narration	By the way, in case you are curious, the last movie was "Halloween Homecoming."																						
29	28		301								Narration	It was a low-cost horror comedy mocking on "Halloween Slaughter." Don't underestimate it though, for it had single-handedly transcended the movie genre.																						
30	29		301								Narration	...Forget about it. You are now inside an old mansion. It is fabulously decorated, but somewhat lacks vitality.																						
31	222		201							2	1031001																							
32	30		301							1	Liv	This place looks so much like my old home...	2

34	31		301								Narration	...																						
35	32		301								Narration	You are standing in a corridor of the mansion. There are a few rooms located on both sides, but their doors are all closed.																						
36	33		301									Before the narrator can finish, Kamui reaches for one of the doors.																						
37	34		201							1	1081001	2	-400																					
38	35		201							2	500166		400																					
39	36		301							1	Kamui	When in doubt, just be bold.	1																					
40	37		301									Kamui pushes the door open with great force, only to find endless darkness on the other side, vaster than he can ever imagine.																						
41	38		301									Having used too much force, Kamui loses balance and is about to fall over—																						
42	39		301								Lucia	Kamui!	2																					
43	40		301									—Fortunately, Lucia reaches out and grabs Kamui's other hand.																						
44	41		301									She pulls him back.																						
45	42		301								Kamui	...Phew, lucky! Thanks, Lucia!	1																					
46	43		301								Lucia	Don't run around. Based on previous experiences, this world should also belong to some horror movie.	2																					
47	44		201							1	500110		-400																					
48	45		301							1	Ayla	Yeah, and I'm actually quite familiar with this one...	1																					
49	46		301								Ayla	"The Evil Demon", one of the iconic dark movies, famous for the way it portrayed the lawful evil demons.	1																					
50	47		301								Ayla	The demons from hell would pick sinful people and pull them into the space of memories, giving them as much pain and disaster as possible...	1																					
51	48		301								Ayla	They would then feast on the screams of the victims.	1																					
52	49		301								Ayla	So I don't think we can apply common sense here, neither should we use sheer force like before...	1																					
53	50		301								Lucia	So we must take caution, right?	2																					
54	51		301								Ayla	That's the only safe way to advance, at least during the first half of the movie.	1																					
55	52		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	...I see. Let's move with caution.	2
