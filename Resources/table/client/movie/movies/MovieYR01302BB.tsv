17	14		201							1	1081001	1																						
18	15		301							1	Kamui	It's the usual avatar-making stuff before entering a game! We have our appearance data already, so we just have to choose our clothes.	1																					
19	16		302								...	17	These are all swimsuits, aren't they?	19																				
20	17		201							1	500025																							
21	18		301							1	Liv	They're all... swimsuits.	1																					
22	19		201							1	500026																							
23	20		301							1	Lee	I'm starting to regret being a part of this.	1																					
24	21		201							1	1081001	2																						
25	22		301							1	Kamui	But why? We Constructs don't normally get to wear clothes like these.	1																					
26	23		202							1																								
27	24		301									Liv looks a little ill at ease when she sees the rows and rows of various swimsuits.																						
28	25		201							1	500025																							
29	26		301							1	Liv	I haven't ever picked outfits other than combat coating... Do you have any recommendations, Commandant?	1																					
30	27		302								Try a bold and daring swimsuit	29	Try a blue school-designated swimsuit	31	Choose something you like	34																		
31	29		301								Liv	Huh...? Eh? Y-you want me to wear this...?	1																					
32	30	33	301									Lee looks over with a gaze that must have burnt through your VR goggles.																						
33	31		201							1	500026																							
34	32		301							1	Lee	Commandant, I never knew you had such... tendencies. I've learned something new about you.	1																					
35	33		302								J-just kidding. Liv, choose something you like.	34																						
36	34		201							1	500025																							
37	35		301							1	Liv	Ah... Then I'll pick this one.	1																					
38	36		202							1																								
39	37		301				DialogDisable					After thinking it over, Liv chooses a black and white swimsuit. Her avatar changes into a swimsuit-wearing one, with a black and white fishtail unfolding behind her.

41	38		302								It suits you, Liv.	40	You look like the daughter of the ocean, like from that story.	40

47	46		301			DialogEnable					Kamui	Hey! You made your choice so quickly! I didn't even get to see the other clothes!																						
48	47		301							1	Lee	There's no need to consider water pressure and resistance when it's all virtual, so the swimwear doesn't matter. Also, didn't you play this before? You should've seen all the clothes already.	1

53	51		204							2	1																							
54	52		301								Kamui	So what should I pick? Commandant, help me!	2																					
55	53		302								Swimming briefs	54	Hawaiian pineapple swimming trunks	58	Rubber ducky swimming trunks	60																		
56	54		301								Kamui	...You think this suits me, Commandant? Well, I guess it's easier to move around with less fabric...	2

60	58		301								Kamui	Oh yeah! This is nice! Feels just like a vacation!	2																					
61	59	62	301								Lee	If you wear that in the game, I'm leaving right now.	1																					
62	60		301								Kamui	This feels kinda weird... Is this duck bill even detachable?	2																					
63	61		301								Lee	...Stop messing with him, Commandant. He'll take it seriously.	1

66	64		301							1	Kamui	Hmm... They all look so fun to wear, though. Which should I choose?	1																					
67	65		201							1	500173																							
68	66		301							1	Lee	I recommend none of them.	1																					
69	67		201							1	500174	1																						
70	68		301							1	Liv	It looks like... The swimsuit Lee chose earlier is one of the more normal-looking ones...	1

72	70		301									Kamui frowns and scrolls through the selection list, then suddenly slaps his thigh.																						
73	71		201							1	1081001	1																						
74	72		301							1	Kamui	Forget it! Clothes don't matter! We don't always get to play together, so let's not waste precious time!	1																					
75	73		301									With that, Kamui exits the clothing catalog and enters the game with his default avatar.																						
76	74		204							1	2																							
77	75		301								Kamui	Well, I've tried all of 'em on when I was playing by myself anyway.	1																					
78	76		301								Kamui	Oh! Let's see... We can play beach volleyball and have matches! Teams of two!	1																					
79	77		301								Kamui	To make it fair, let's play rock-paper-scissors! Winners one team, losers the other.	1																					
80	78		301								Kamui	I know you guys will all want to be on Commandant's team if I let you choose.	1
