6	6		301									Despite the situation of the train not looking good, and the floorboards ferociously shaking under his feet, the man named Aston didn't waver an inch.																						
7	7		301									Maintaining his pace, he strides forward with confidence, and even saluted Gray Raven.

13	13	16	301							1	Aston	Babylonia sent you here without explaining the situation to you beforehand?	1																					
14	14		201							1	500126																							
15	15		301							1	Aston	To a merchant, there's nothing more important than trading.	1																					
16	16		204							1	8																							
17	17		301								Aston	It seems that you have not fully grasped the situation yet...	1																					
18	18		204							1																								
19	19		301								Aston	Allow me to explain.	1																					
20	20		301								Aston	According to our intel, there was a huge battle between Babylonia and the space station not so long ago. And in that battle, "something important" that belonged to the space station crashed onto this train.	1																					
21	21		202							1					1																			
22	22		201							2	1021001

25	25		201							1	500126																							
26	26		301							1	Aston	No, we will not, and will not allow you to do so. Unless we reach a deal.	1																					
27	27		301								Aston	After all, that is our most valuable merchandise.	1

30	30		301							1	Lee	You're using the Hetero-Core as a bargaining chip...? Are you people mad? That's the enemy of all humanity!	3

32	32		201							1	500126	8																						
33	33		301							1	Aston	Anyhow, our demand is simple—let us move in to Babylonia.	1

38	38		201							1	500126																							
39	39		301							1	Aston	Hmph, asking useless questions.	1																					
40	40		301								Aston	Babylonia in outer space is currently the safest place in the universe. Although this train has kept us alive,	1																					
41	41		301								Aston	I still believe going to Babylonia is the only way to achieve true safety.	1																					
42	42		301								Aston	What do you think about this deal, commandant from Babylonia?	1																					
43	43		302								I'm not authorized to make this deal.	44	And if we refuse...?	47																				
44	44		301								Aston	Then who has the authority to do so, and can you get in contact with them? I'd like a reply as soon as possible, if not...	1

50	50		301							1	???	Then I guess we'll have to make the deal with the Ascendants then.	2																					
51	51		202							2					1																			
52	52		201							3	500125																							
53	53		301							1	Jamilah	Wait, that's not what we agreed on before. We agreed to wait for an answer from Babylonia first...	3																					
54	54		202							3					1																			
55	55		301									Their leader, a teenage girl who stood silently when the aristocrat was talking, suddenly objected.																						
56	56		201							2	500129																							
57	57		301							1	???	Little girls shouldn't meddle in this matter. And it's obvious, the Ascendants are far more superior to those from Babylonia.	2

60	60		301							1	Aston	Ashlar, Princess Jamilah is the current leader of the ACA, and as a member of Akdilek, you should show some respect.	1

66	66		201							1	500126	8																						
67	67		301							1	Aston	There's no friend or foe in commerce. While you were dilly-dallying, this train has been approaching the designated meeting point with the Ascendants.	1																					
68	68		301								Aston	We are merchants, and we only want to gain the biggest profit from a deal. To us, both Babylonia and the Ascendants are just trading partners.	1																					
69	69		301								Aston	And as you can see, Ashlar suggested the Ascendants as our trading partner, while I, on the other hand, wanted to expand our options.	1																					
70	70		302								Us?	71	Why would you make deal with the Ascendants?	75																				
71	71		204							1																								
72	72		301								Aston	Yes, if Babylonia can provide a satisfying answer swiftly, then we need not head toward such dangerous areas full of Punishing Virus to "deliver the goods."	1																					
73	73		301								Aston	From how I see it, it's a win-win, and all that are wise would choose this.	1

95	95		301									The aristocrats behind Ashlar become agitated—																						
96	96		301									Some even ignore the leader of Akdilek standing right in front of them and scramble for the front carriages.
