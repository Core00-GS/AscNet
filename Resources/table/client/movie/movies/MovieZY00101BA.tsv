4	4		301			DialogEnable					Message	Gray Raven, here is the routine dispatch for your ground operation. We have left several supply crates on your planned route.																						
5	5		301								Message	There are serums, repair kits, and spare parts in these crates. I'm sure they will be helpful in your upcoming fights.																						
6	6		301								Message	Although I should end this message now with a typical "bon voyage"...																						
7	7		301								Message	I must apologize—there is an unexpected task we hope you can take on before collecting your supplies.																						
8	8		301								Message	We hope you can search for a few supply crates that have landed in no man's land after veering off their original trajectory.																						
9	9		301								Message	While you can ignore this request, I'm afraid this is the only supply drop for this mission, so...

24	16	1010	301								Liv	The Punishing Virus concentration in this area is pretty minimal... And they aren't acting like Corrupted, either.	1																					
25	17	1010	301								Lucia	Maybe, maybe not... But we would've been warned beforehand if there were a massive horde of Corrupted in this area.	2

29	18		301							1	Lee	Either way, this doesn't look like a no man's land at all.	3																					
30	19		301									Lee is referring to the various structures before you. These buildings might see some damage here and there, but they are largely intact overall.																						
31	20		301									You can even see signs of repairs done on the exterior walls.																						
32	1013		302								Did those mechanoids make these?	21	(Touch it)	22																				
33	21	23	301								Lee	In a way. All of these buildings are in fact holograms.	3																					
34	22	23	301								Lee	Commandant, I would refrain from doing that. They are all holograms only.	3																					
35	23		301									Lee points upward at the sky as he says it, and you all notice the recon drones hovering in the air.																						
36	24		301								Lee	They're simultaneously moving and scanning the area, all the while coordinating with each other to adjust their projections. It's quite an effective way to create a holographic environment.	3																					
37	25		301								Lee	Based on their scale, I'm afraid everything we're seeing here is just a projection.	3																					
38	1014		302								Who's controlling these mechanoids?	26	Let's look for the supply crates first.	27																				
39	26	1015	301								Lee	I have no idea. Should we look into it, Commandant?	3																					
40	27	1015	301								Lucia	The situation is peculiar, but our main objective here is to retrieve the supply crates. Let's start our search as the commandant said.	2

46	1018		302								And you are?	30	We aren't odd!	31																				
47	30	1019	301								Foreman	Y'all just gonna request a self-introduction right out of the gate, huh? I ain't got no name nor title, so you can just call me "Foreman" like the rest of them!	1

58	1022		302								(Explain yourself)	36																						
59	36		301								Foreman	...That means you just happened upon our place, is that so?	1

64	38		301							1	Lee	You can find Babylonia's logo on them. They should be quite easy to identify.	3																					
65	39		301								Foreman	I don't know nothing about supply crates, but we did pick up some weird boxes with strange pictures on them a while ago.	1																					
66	40		301								Lucia	That would be what we're looking for! Where are they now?	2																					
67	41		301								Foreman	They're now rewards for the "Fist of the Taoist".	1																					
68	42		301								Lucia	"Fist of the Taoist"?	2																					
69	1026		302								What is this "Fist of the Taoist"?	43	But those are ours!	44																				
70	43	45	301								Foreman	A competition to determine who the "Fist of the Taoist" is, obviously! Hey, seeing that y'all are here already, do you want to give it a go?	1																					
71	44	45	301								Foreman	You should've labeled them "Not Rewards for the Fist of the Taoist" then, shouldn't you? You want them back? Join the competition and win!	1																					
72	45		301								Lucia	What you're saying is... the only way we can get our supply crates back is to join this competition of yours?	2																					
73	46		301								Foreman	You're welcome to take them back by force, as long as you're cool with making enemies of us all.	1																					
74	1027		302								Let's take the path of least resistance.		Can you tell me more about this Fist of the Taoist?																					
75	47		301								Foreman	You should know that this is our big celebration for the yearly Ghost Festival! We mechanoids will be undergoing the trials to become a Taoist, as well as participating in a ghost-hunting competition!	1																					
76	48		301								Lee	I have no idea where you get all this information from, but does the title of the Fist of the Taoist mean anything special to you?	3																					
77	49		301								Foreman	Are you teasing us about our knowledge of ghost-hunting? I'll let you know that we folks here watch Ghost Expert daily! DAILY!	1																					
78	1028		204							3	10																							
79	50		301								Lee	...Are you telling me that all the mechanoids here are fans of Ghost Expert?	3																					
80	1029		302								What is this Ghost Expert?	51	Is this a fan convention?	52																				
81	51	53	301								Lee	Probably a movie about this Taoist Foreman was talking about.	3																					
82	52	53	301								Foreman	T-this ain't no fan convention! It's a study group with dedicated researchers! Not fans!	1																					
83	53		301								Lucia	So how do we participate in this competition, and how do we win?	2																					
84	54		301								Foreman	That's simple. First of all, you must pass the trials from our East, South, West, and North Generals, obtaining the qualification of a ghost hunter.	1																					
85	55		301								Foreman	Afterward, you will use your qualifications to enter the four ghost-hunting venues we set up according to their order and hunt some ghosts!	1																					
86	56		301								Foreman	The first one who goes through all four venues is the real Fist of the Taoist!	1																					
87	57		301								Lucia	We will get our supply crates back after we become the Taoist, right?	2																					
88	58		301								Foreman	You don't get them back—you're rewarded with them!	1																					
89	1030		204							2	1																							
90	59		301								Lucia	Speed is of the essence, then. In that case, we shouldn't waste any more time, Commandant. Let's go.	2
