17	17		301									After a long trek, Gabriel finally arrives at the base of the Observatory. Here inside the light wall, free of the flames of war, Gabriel is almost like a theater actor waiting for the audience.

19	19		301							1	Gabriel	The Corrupted I've brought should create enough of a diversion. This tower should hold what I seek.	1

21	21		301									The Gestalt-like creation must be inside, but the tower will certainly be littered with traps.																						
22	22		301									Direct confrontation does not concern Gabriel, but unforeseen circumstances—the prospect of disappointing Luna—does.
