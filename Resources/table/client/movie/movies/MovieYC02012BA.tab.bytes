6	6		301									Another agent. How interesting.																						
7	7		301									But Roland isn't surprised at all.																						
8	8		301									This gold-masked agent wouldn't spend so much time and effort to invite him for a coffee.																						
9	9		301									Still, the offer was very cliche. "What is this, a villain in some cult B-rated superhero movie"? Roland thinks.																						
10	10		301									But this man named Vonnegut... is looking at him.																						
11	11		201							1	500305																							
12	12		301							1	Vonnegut	You don't look too satisfied.	1																					
13	13		301								Vonnegut	You either think I'm a fool, or... you prefer to seize the thing you want with your own hands.	1																					
14	14		201							1	500334	2																						
15	15		301							1	Roland	Is there a difference?	1																					
16	16		201							1	500305																							
17	17		301							1	Vonnegut	No. Or, should I say, they are equally interesting.	1																					
18	18		201							1	500334	2																						
19	19		301							1	Roland	I'll go with the former if you can't give me a reason in your next five sentences.	1																					
20	20		201							1	500305																							
21	21		301							1	Vonnegut	"Miss Luna". Is that enough?	1																					
22	22		201							1	500334				1																			
23	23		301							1		Eureka, Roland thinks.																						
24	24		301									The question now is how to get the information from him.																						
25	25		201							1	500305																							
26	26		301							1	Vonnegut	Right now, you are probably thinking about how to get that information from me.	1																					
27	27		201							1	500334	2																						
28	28		301							1	Roland	Isn't that the standard procedure?	1																					
29	29		201							1	500305																							
30	30		301							1	Vonnegut	You know it yourself.	1																					
31	31		201							1	500334	2																						
32	32		301							1	Roland	Are you going to let me do that?	1																					
33	33		201							1	500305																							
34	34		301							1	Vonnegut	It depends on whether you accept my offer or not.	1																					
35	35		301									The man named Vonnegut gives Roland a meaningful look.																						
36	36		301									He does not seem to be in a rush for answers, but Roland cannot rule out the possibility that he won't be able to leave alive without a concrete answer.																						
37	37		301									Roland is pretty sure that if they want to keep him here, they are most likely able to.																						
38	38		301									That Cinderelik girl's power alone shocks him. Roland has never thought the power of Ascendants can be used in that way.																						
39	39		301								Vonnegut	Think about it. I know what you are pursuing. Even though I may not agree with you... but I will help you find it.	1																					
40	40		301								Vonnegut	"Find" is probably not a good word... But one day, you will get to see it.	1																					
41	41		301								Vonnegut	As long as you provide reasonable assistance to what I want to do. Of course, I promise I will put your talent to good use.	1

48	48		301							1	Roland	Really?	1																					
49	49		301								Roland	My former "colleague" might have a different opinion.	1																					
50	50		301								Roland	Too bad he cannot express this himself, so I'll do this on his behalf.	1																					
51	51		301								Roland	What do you think? Mr. "Vonnegut"?	1																					
52	52		201							1	500305																							
53	53		301							1	Vonnegut	...	1																					
54	54		201							1	500334	2																						
55	55		301							1		He's gone silent. This is good.																						
56	56		301									As long as...																						
57	57		201							1	500305																							
58	58		301							1	Vonnegut	What do you think of this former colleague of yours?	1																					
59	59		201							1	500334	5																						
60	60		301							2		Dammit, he throws the question back.																						
61	61		301									Gabriel... Roland had no comment for him ever since the Polyphage incident.																						
62	62		301									He only brought him up to make the guy in front embarrassed.																						
63	63		301									If that's the case...																						
64	64		204							1	2																							
65	65		301								Roland	He's a useless piece of junk.	1																					
66	66		301								Roland	I know he died. A well-deserved death, I would say?	1																					
67	67		301								Roland	That was as far as he could ever reach.	1																					
68	68		201							1	500305																							
69	69		301							1	Vonnegut	Oh?	1																					
70	70		201							1	500334	2																						
71	71		301							1	Roland	If you know what I want, you shouldn't be surprised at what I said.	1																					
72	72		201							1	500305																							
73	73		301							1	Vonnegut	So?	1																					
74	74		301								Vonnegut	In that case, you should already have an answer.	1																					
75	75		201							1	500334	2																						
76	76		301							1	Roland	What if I say no?	1																					
77	77		201							1	500308																							
78	78		301							1	Cinderelik	Are you turning Mr. Vonnegut down?	1																					
79	79		301									Before Roland realizes, Cinderelik is already standing behind him.																						
80	80		301									She is playing with a Jitterbomb. Her fingers are gently rubbing its belly, making its antennae tremble.																						
81	81		201							1	500334	2																						
82	82		301							1	Roland	What? Are you all too scared to say no to him?	1																					
83	83		201							1	500308																							
84	84		301							1	Cinderelik	Not really.	1																					
85	85		301								Cinderelik	But those who did all ended up proving that Mister was right when they lay six feet underground.	1																					
86	86		201							1	500305																							
87	87		301							1	Vonnegut	They only chose the future they deserved.	1																					
88	88		301								Vonnegut	And I had no right to stop them from doing that.	1																					
89	89		301								Vonnegut	The same applies to you, Roland.	1																					
90	90		201							1	500334																							
91	91		301							1		Roland did not reply. He just stares at Vonnegut, waiting for him to continue.																						
92	92		301									Just like what he has been doing all this time.																						
93	93		301									Roland has no need to disclose his real purpose, or to worry about Vonnegut's true intention.																						
94	94		301									If this agent throws him an offer, all he has to do is to repeat what he did before.																						
95	95		301									"What exactly do you want?" Roland is waiting for Vonnegut to tell him what he wants from him.																						
96	96		201							1	500305																							
97	97		301							1	Vonnegut	To make it simple, I'd like to watch you pursue your own future.	1																					
98	98		301								Vonnegut	I will therefore make your wishes come true, provided that you give me something of equal value in return.	1																					
99	99		301								Vonnegut	Then you only need to choose between "my future" and "your future."	1																					
100	100		301								Vonnegut	A very good deal, don't you think?	1																					
101	101		201							1	500334																							
102	102		301							1		Right, a very good deal. Too good to be true.																						
103	103		301									Even now, this man has not revealed what Roland wants to know most.																						
104	104		301									People have their desires. So do Ascendants.																						
105	105		301									Just like Luna, this guy has extremely strong desires.																						
106	106		301									Roland knows it very well, and he begins to fear the desire that Vonnegut is yet to reveal.																						
107	107		301									‚ÄîPerhaps this is exactly what Vonnegut wants him to feel.																						
108	108		301									Is that so? Keeping your card to make me fear?																						
109	109		204							1	2																							
110	110		301								Roland	Very good. But what do you want from me?	1																					
111	111		301								Roland	I don't think you are a philanthropist. I mean, you are keeping such a formidable sidekick.	1																					
112	112		301									Roland tilts his head at Cinderelik, who is standing behind him.																						
113	113		201							1	500308																							
114	114		301							1	Cinderelik	Mister is not a philanthropist.	1																					
115	115		301								Cinderelik	We had a very fair deal.	1																					
116	116		201							1	500334	2																						
117	117		301							1	Roland	So, what did he ask from you?	1																					
118	118		201							1	500308																							
119	119		301							1	Cinderelik	I need knowledge.	1																					
120	120		301								Cinderelik	Mister will take away the by-products from my experiments.	1																					
121	121		201							1	500305																							
122	122		301							1	Vonnegut	A very reasonable deal.	1																					
123	123		201							1	500308																							
124	124		301							1	Cinderelik	Exactly.	1																					
125	125		201							1	500334	2																						
126	126		301							1	Roland	That's enough business talk.	1																					
127	127		301								Roland	I'm not in the mood to appreciate your teacher-student relationship.	1																					
128	128		201							1	500305																							
129	129		301							1	Vonnegut	I'm sorry.	1																					
130	130		301								Vonnegut	Anyway, it's time to make up your mind.	1																					
131	131		301								Vonnegut	I sent Cinderelik to pick you up because of what you said to Voodoo.	1																					
132	132		301								Vonnegut	I trust you have seen enough now.	1																					
133	133		201							1	500334																							
134	134		301							1	Roland	...	1																					
135	135		201							1	500305																							
136	136		301							1	Vonnegut	Make your choice.	1																					
137	137		301								Vonnegut	Then accept all the things you deserve.	1																					
138	138		201							1	500334																							
139	139		301							1	Roland	...	1																					
140	140		301									What shall I do?																						
141	141		301									Roland isn't in fear or lost. He is not going with the flow, nor is he struggling.																						
142	142		301									This man in front of him is definitely offering him an opportunity.																						
143	143		301									But he does not know whether this gift box will bring him light or maggot when opened.																						
144	144		301									All he knows is the gift of destiny awaits.																						
145	145		301								Roland	I...	1																					
146	146		301									What is it? What's behind this gift?																						
147	147		301									Does it matter? Or not?																						
148	148		301									Enlighten me, hermano. It's been quite some time since you last showed up.																						
149	149		301									Why are you not showing up? Do you think I am capable of making decisions now? Or have you given up on me?																						
150	150		301									Roland feels his invisible nerves are getting tense. His eyes are getting dry.																						
151	151		301									The Construct body no longer has the function, but he feels like he is sweating at the back of his neck.

159	159		301								Roland?	You are just who you are.																						
160	160		301								Roland?	You aren't anyone else. You aren't an item. You are just yourself, the one and only you in this world.																						
161	161		301								Roland?	Go onward, and one day you will be able to answer me‚Äîwho are you?																						
162	162		301								Roland?	Your ideals, your recognition, your violence, your cunning.																						
163	163		301								Roland?	Maybe you need someone to rely on, some belief to follow, or a mission to give you a reason to live on.																						
164	164		301								Roland?	But you are unique. There's no one else like you in this world.

182	182		301									There is no such thing as destiny in this world. Heaven or hell does not exist either.																						
183	183		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The so-called "destiny" is one's own choice. It is their own path taken, the blood spilled on their own hands, the words they acknowledge.

186	186		301									Roland looks at the gold-masked man. He no longer hates the pressure from him.																						
187	187		301									From now on, everything will be his token. He will play them, use them, and sacrifice them.																						
188	188		301								Vonnegut	Well then, tell me what you want‚Äî																						
189	189		301									Of course, stronger tokens are more desirable.																						
190	190		301									These people in front of him make perfect tokens. Roland can send them to hell without hesitation.																						
191	191		301									How will the world become when Luna returns?																						
192	192		301								Roland	I want power. Yours, and mine.																						
193	193		301								Vonnegut	Of course I will give you your power. What about mine?																						
194	194		301									There is no need to think.																						
195	195		301									Roland feels the familiar yet strange world disappear around him. He sees a tight rope connecting him and fate.																						
196	196		301									Too easy. The choice is too easy.																						
197	197		301								Roland	I hope you can lend me a hand when I'm in need, Sir.																						
198	198		301								Roland	You won't lose anything.																						
199	199		301									Roland sees a trace of surprise in Vonnegut's eyes. He didn't expect such a request.																						
200	200		301									Out of the corner of his eye, Roland sees Cinderelik open her mouth, but Vonnegut dismisses her attempt.																						
201	201		301								Vonnegut	An interesting request. I cannot give you a guarantee, but you can look forward to it.

212	212		301									Who cares about how much fate will ask for what it bestows?																						
213	213		301									Roland finally understands what "result" means. He can now think beyond the orders and requests given to him.																						
214	214		301									When the price he asks is significantly higher than his value, his life no longer matters compared with the possibility of finding an "answer."
