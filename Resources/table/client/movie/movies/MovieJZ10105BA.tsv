6	6		301								Professor	Also, you asked, and I checked—your HLA matches with your younger brother's. But, are you sure about this?	2																					
7	7		301								Morian	As long as you keep your end of the bargain—the money for the surgery, an urgent slot for the operation, a guaranteed normal life for Murray afterward, and... my heart transplantation.	1																					
8	8		301								Professor	Not only so, but I'll also ensure your younger brother the highest degree of privileges for the rest of his life, even... a ticket to "Babylonia".	2																					
9	9		301								Morian	...As long as Murray's safe.	1																					
10	10		301								Professor	I did also test your brother's Tantalum-193 affinity, and it's also quite high. Would you perhaps consider an artificial heart for him? Then you wouldn't have to take this risk.	2																					
11	11		301								Morian	Don't even think about touching my brother. I know full well the danger of your experiments. You're gambling with our lives. I'll take the risk, so that my brother can stay out of this.	1																					
12	12		301								Professor	Don't be so pessimistic, if the experiment succeeds, you'll...	2																					
13	13		301								Morian	I'm not interested in your plans.	1																					
14	14		301								Professor	...Anyway, I'll have someone bring him here before the experiment begins. Don't worry, he'll get the best of the best.	2																					
15	15		301								Professor	A first-class doctor will be performing the surgery for your brother when our experiment begins.	2																					
16	16		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Professor	Go meet him for one last time... your last time as a human.	2
