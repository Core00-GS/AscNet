4	4		301									Back to when Roland first ventured into this prison.																						
5	5		201							1	500334	1																						
6	6		301							1		What compelled him to do so was nothing serious like a secret mission, but more due to his own curiosity.																						
7	7		202							1					1																			
8	8		301									The mechanoids in the prison were still carrying out the duty they were manufactured for. Apparently, all the guards were bionic mechanoids in order to lower the hostility of prisoners.																						
9	9		301									Their appearances are nothing but human, but all they know are to obey the rules. They did not accept bribes, nor did they require rest. To a prison, nothing is better than cheap yet efficient labor.																						
10	10		301									However, now corrupted, they are nothing but a virus to this abandoned prison. Usually, corrupted mechanoids would lose all self-control and would not be able to carry out the job they were programmed to do anymore.																						
11	11		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					But the Corrupted in this prison were still doing their jobs as if they were not corrupted at all. In this world where the prisoners were long gone, this kind of empty performances can be found all over a post-apocalyptic world.																						
12	12		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory35.jpg																								
13	13		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Roland has always loved participating in these performances. He pretended to be a prisoner arrested for theft and was "transferred" to a prison cell by a Corrupted, all the while observing the actions of all mechanoids he passed.																						
14	14		301									The cleaning bots kept cleaning the same spot, creating a patch of shiny tiles among the ruins; the guards patrolled the corridors, their movement precise enough to draw a line on the floor that showed their route. And then there was that poor guy who kept circling the stairs due to its broken navigation system.																						
15	15		201							1	500334	1																						
16	16		301							1		Among the tattered Corrupted stood a smiling "prisoner." Nothing could be more wrong with this picture, but Roland seemed to enjoy it.																						
17	17		202							1					1																			
18	18		301									The mechanoids' workflow was meticulously planned, but without regular maintenance from humans, only a slight disturbance in the flow could lead to chaos.																						
19	19		301									Because of the string of errors it triggered, a bionic mechanoid guard made the judgment that a prisoner was escaping, thus activating the alarm system of the whole prison.																						
20	20		301									—All because Roland decided to take the baton from a Corrupted guard when it was "changing shifts."																						
21	21		401							2	1501																							
22	22		401							1	201																							
23	23		301									This led to a series of chain reactions. The resting guards were activated, the red alarm lights kept flickering, and all exits were locked up, leaving Roland trapped in this complicated prison like a real prisoner who failed to escape.																						
24	24		301									Of course, these locks and doors of the old age were nothing to him. One blast later, Roland was strolling out of his destroyed cell.																						
25	25		301									—Which also caused all the Corrupted to descend into chaos. However, this was not a problem for Roland. Even when the gates were locked, it would not be hard to break out. It would just require some work.																						
26	26		301									That was when Roland discovered something far more intriguing than the Corrupted.																						
27	27		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					—An unfortunate fellow who was also trapped in this prison.

35	35		301							1	Roland?	Need you even ask, my friend?	2																					
36	36		301								Roland?	Of course we should fill this human with horror and despair, and then force them to abandon a stranger to save their own life.	2																					
37	37		301								Roland?	—Like in those boring Golden Age movies.	2																					
38	38		301								Roland?	Poor little Roland, abandoned in the face of danger once again.	2																					
39	39		301								Roland?	But one thing is different now, you're not that weak little human anymore.	2																					
40	40		301								Roland?	You have a choice. To kill or let live, you decide.	2																					
41	41		301								Roland?	I can't wait to savor the expression of that human when they realize that they are the one who is abandoned.	2																					
42	42		301								Roland	Why would I want to do that?	1																					
43	43		301								Roland?	Because you're bored, of course.	2

47	48		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The shadow in his heart replied.																						
48	49		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						—However, things did not go in the direction Roland had expected.																						
49	50		301									The person on the other end of the line was neither frightened nor desperate. They calmly planned an escape for the both of them.																						
50	51		301									Roland felt something familiar from his exchanges with this person even though it was only through text.																						
51	52		301									Even in dire situations, they were able to stay collected and devise an escape plan. They even examined different possibilities and created contingencies for them. They put the safety of others first in the face of danger—this kind of behavior feels more like an experienced veteran than a Scavenger.																						
52	53		301									It made him sick to think that person was nothing but kind to a stranger. It reminded him of a certain human whom he had come across a few times.																						
53	54		301									—Well, it may only have been a few meetings for that human, but Roland had actually been observing them for quite some time now.																						
54	55		301									Half out of curiosity and half to achieve his own "goal."																						
55	56		301								Roland	Can it actually be... them?	1																					
56	57		301									He scoffs at his own thought the next second. No reason for baseless speculations.																						
57	58		301									But he has to admit that this stranger has piqued his interest. He's even thinking of asking them to join him.																						
58	59		204							1	1																							
59	60		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	You have certainly caught my interest... Tell me, who are you?	1																					
60	61		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory84.jpg																								
61	62		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After the gates are unlocked, Roland reaches the planned rendezvous point—the cafeteria.																						
62	63		301									He makes his way up to the second floor, looking over the railings and at the Zone A entrance where that person will enter from.																						
63	64		301									Finally, he hears human footsteps from the other end of the corridor.																						
64	65		204							1	7																							
65	66		301									The second Roland gets a good look at the stranger, he feels like someone was clenching at his guts.																						
66	67		301									Even with all the thick exoskeleton and protective equipment, Roland can still instantly recognize that person.																						
67	68		301									—【kuroname】.																						
68	69		301									What was just a baseless speculation turns out to be true.																						
69	70		301									His imaginary "partner" is now standing opposite to him.																						
70	71		301									Roland immediately retracts his steps after coming to this realization. Instead of walking forward like he had wanted to, he backs up into the shadows by the wall.																						
71	72		301									There has always only been one ending for him—abandoned.																						
72	73		301									Abandoned by his parents, by his "friends," and as a failed experiment.																						
73	74		301									In the end, all he had was himself.

76	77		301							1	Roland?	You thought you found a "friend"?	2																					
77	78		301								Roland?	Don't make me laugh. You've always been alone and always will be.	2																					
78	79		301								Roland?	Everything was just an illusion.	2																					
79	80		301								Roland?	You're not others and others will never be you.	2																					
80	81		301								Roland?	You'll always be walking in this maze of your own making.	2
