112	113		301									In front of you is the familiar Gray Raven lounge. Fortunately, it is not in ruins as you imagined. You see a red package left at a very obvious place outside the lounge door.																						
113	114		301									It seems the sender wanted to tie a complicated knot, but gave up half-way.																						
114	115		301									The package is entangled in rope. It doesn't look like the rope can be easily untied.

177	178		301									It first starts to wiggle slightly on the table, but soon realizes something is limiting its movement. After a short pause, two lines of diamond-shaped black blades have pierced through the red paper.
