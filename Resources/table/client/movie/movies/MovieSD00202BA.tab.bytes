6	6		301								Chrome	Sorry for bothering you... I'm just wondering if you've seen Kamui anywhere?	1																					
7	7		302								I haven't, sorry.	8	I think I saw him heading that way.	9																				
8	8	10	301								Chrome	Oh, in that case... Thank you very much, I'll look somewhere else.	1																					
9	9		301								Chrome	So he's been here? Thank you very much. I'll check it out.	1

12	12		301									As the Strike Hawk Leader departs the corridor, a blond young man pokes his head out from a sliding door behind you.

15	15		301							1	Kamui	Is he gone? Alright, alright, alright... I knew you wouldn't betray me!	1																					
16	16		302								???	17	Where did you come from...	17																				
17	17		204							1	2																							
18	18		301								Kamui	It doesn't matter! What matters is that Capt doesn't find out what I've stolen from the armory...	1																					
19	19		302								???	20	What did you do again?!	20																				
20	20		204							1	1																							
21	21		301								Kamui	Take a look!	1																					
22	22		301									He turns around and shows you the peculiar-looking greatsword he is carrying on the back like a swordsman.																						
23	23		302								This is...	24	Star of Bethlehem?	24																				
24	24		202							1					1																			
25	25		301									A greatsword inspired by the Christmas tree, it is a custom-made weapon created for Christmas last year.																						
26	26		301									Its blade is in the shape of a Christmas tree, with the Star of Bethlehem attached to its point. Together the sword looks remarkably festive.																						
27	27		301									However, as a special festival weapon, the most extraordinary feature of the greatsword is perhaps the fact that it "can play Christmas-appropriate music."																						
28	28		201							1	1081001	1																						
29	29		301							1	Kamui	I know, right? The Weapon Department confiscated it last year after Christmas, saying a holiday weapon should only be used during a holiday...	1																					
30	30		302								I thought they took it because you were playing music with it in the corridor the whole night?	31																						
31	31		301								Kamui	But it's Christmas soon! We've gotta have it with us!	1																					
32	32		301									Kamui leans in like a puppy begging.																						
33	33		301								Kamui	Everyone in Babylonia deserves something this awesome. Imagine everyone playing the Christmas symphony with the Star of Bethlehem on Christmas Eve at the same time...	1																					
34	34		302								...	35	That's a cool idea.	35																				
35	35		301								Kamui	Anyway, I'm preparing it as a surprise this Christmas Eve!	1																					
36	36		301									Kamui's hand slams on your shoulder so hard that you almost black out for a second.																						
37	37		302								But is it a good idea to steal it?	38																						
38	38		204							1	2																							
39	39		301								Kamui	Oh, Ayla said she has my back! She'll sort this out for me as soon as I'm done helping her with her Christmas Tree...	1

41	41		204							1	1																							
42	42		301								Kamui	Just wait and see, Commandant! It's gonna be a super-duper perfect Christmas Eve!	1																					
43	43		302								Can't wait.	44	I hope you didn't just jinx it.	44																				
44	44		301								Kamui	Hehe, then I'll see you soon!	1

46	46		301									Kamui waves and heads toward the other end of the corridor.

48	48		301							1	Kamui	Right, Commandantâ€”	1																					
49	49		301									He turns around after a few steps, flapping his hands.																						
50	50		301								Kamui	In case I don't see you thenâ€”Happy Christmas Eve!	1
