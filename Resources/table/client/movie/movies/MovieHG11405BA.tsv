4	4		301							1	Rosetta	Do you know how to fish, Commandant?	1																					
5	5		301									While doing mission work in the snow, Rosetta suddenly throws a question at you.																						
6	6		302								Kinda sorta.	10																						
7	10		301								Rosetta	Kinda sorta...? Which means you should learn how to properly fish. Grab your fishing pole, Commandant.	1																					
8	11		301								Rosetta	We've had a few mishaps so far, but at least we managed to start a fire and set up camp.	1																					
9	12		301								Rosetta	Next up, time to learn about how to secure food.	1																					
10	13		302								Can't we just eat rations?	14	So we need to fish?	15																				
11	14	16	301								Rosetta	That's not really in accordance with nature. Plus, fresh fish is loads better than the rations from Babylonia.	1																					
12	15		301								Rosetta	Yup. The Forest Guards live in accordance with nature, so fishing is one of the ways we do that.	1																					
13	16		301								Rosetta	I have all the necessary tools ready this time. Commandant, we just need to find a good place to fish.	1

16	19		301									30 minutes later—																						
17	20		201							1	500214																							
18	21		301							1	Rosetta	...	1																					
19	22		302								Any bites, Rosetta?	23	(Feeling a little tired...)	23																				
20	23		301								Rosetta	...	1																					
21	24		301									Rosetta's silence speaks louder than words. The fishing bucket is sloshing around in the liveliness of pure sea water.																						
22	25		301									In other words, not so much as a nibble.																						
23	26		301								Rosetta	Today's not my lucky day... Can't help it...	1																					
24	27		202							1																								
25	28		301									As if taking a blow to her heart, Rosetta picks up a rock and hurls it after a long exasperated sigh.																						
26	29		302								Whoa, deja vu.	30	Stop!	30																				
27	30		201							1	500214	5																						
28	31		301							1	Rosetta	Special summon!	1																					
29	32		202							1																								
30	33		301									Instantly, you realize Rosetta's nefarious plans. However, you are helpless in stopping the tragedy from unfolding.																						
31	34		301									The special-summon rock skips for over twenty times before sinking into the sea.																						
32	35		301									Silence fills the air, then compresses into tension. Rosetta fixes her eyes on the shore, waiting for the fated arrival.																						
33	36		301									But her expectant gaze is only met with the reticent and gentle waves of the sea. The watery ritual did not summon the furry bionic; the air is absent of his signature roar.																						
34	37		301									Which is to be expected. After all, even coincidences have its limits.																						
35	38		201							1	500208																							
36	39		301							1	Bionic Bear	Oh. Just saw you two from afar and decided to come ashore early.	1																					
37	40		302								Huh!?																							
38	41		201							1	500214																							
39	42		301							1	Rosetta	Huh!?	1																					
40	43		201							1	500208																							
41	44		401							1	205																							
42	45		301							1	Bionic Bear	Why do you look so surprised? No, wait! The last two rocks might have been accidents, but this time, you're definitely tryna land it!	1																					
43	46		201							1	500214	8																						
44	47		301							1	Rosetta	Well... I only know how to summon you this way.	1																					
45	48		201							1	500208																							
46	49		301							1	Bionic Bear	...	1																					
47	50		301								Bionic Bear	So you want me to help catch fish this time, aye?	1																					
48	51		201							1	500214	4																						
49	52		301							1	Rosetta	Yeah. No bites so far, no choice but to catch fish directly. But Commandant does not have diving gear, and I'm also not built for underwater operations.	1																					
50	53		301								Rosetta	Think you could help out? We're about done for today, so I want the commandant to have a taste of the Arctic flavor if possible.	1																					
51	54		201							1	500208																							
52	55		301							1	Bionic Bear	Yeah, yeah... Y'know, you rocky horrorshow kinda rubs me the wrong way, but seeing you here with an empty bucket all day does make me feel kinda sorry.	1																					
53	56		301								Bionic Bear	Alright then, I'll give you some of my fish.	1																					
54	57		302								You'll give us fish?	58	Thanks.	63																				
55	58		301								Bionic Bear	What? Got a problem with that?	1																					
56	59		201							1	500214																							
57	60		301							1	Rosetta	I think Commandant is wondering why you're "giving" us fish, instead of catching.	1																					
58	61		201							1	500208																							
59	62	64	301							1	Bionic Bear	Pah. Then I'll have to get my fur all wet again.	1																					
60	63		301								Bionic Bear	Pfffah, just be grateful is all.	1																					
61	64		202							1																								
62	65		301									With that, the bionic bear opens up his tummy and a refrigerator compartment appears before your eyes.																						
63	66		201							1	500214																							
64	67		301							1	Rosetta	...You have a fridge for your belly? You bionics are just like Swiss Army knives, aren't you?	1																					
65	68		201							1	500208																							
66	69		301							1	Bionic Bear	There's like ten other functions or so, which are all highly practical. Alright! How about a roast fish for the human right here on the spot? You can trust your bear's grill!	1																					
67	70		202							1																								
68	71		301									The bear treats you to a delicious dinner.																						
69	72		301									——																						
70	74		201							1	500214																							
71	75		301							1	Rosetta	It's already night, huh... I went fishing some more after that, but no luck.	1																					
72	76		302								You'll get a bite eventually.	77	Let's just have the bear help next time as well.	78																				
73	77	79	301								Rosetta	I'll keep trying, but it seems like fishing still takes luck after all.	1																					
74	78		301								Rosetta	Yeah. If we still can't get any bites, let's do so.	1																					
75	79		301									With that, Rosetta looks up at the sky.																						
76	80		301								Rosetta	Only one last area to survey...	1																					
77	81		204							1	8																							
78	82		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Rosetta	Just... my lucky day.	1
