62	62		301							1	Vera	Happy April Fool's Day, Asimov.	2																					
63	63		301								Asimov	Stop digressing. You took the connection chamber out, didn't you? And you let those outside the project know about it.	1																					
64	64		301								Vera	Does it really matter? I've got the discovery of the century on my hands though. The Gray Raven Commandant can use the remote connection technique almost perfectly.	2																					
65	65		301								Vera	But you knew that long ago, didn't you?	2																					
66	66		301								Asimov	Stop answering my questions with questions... Whatever, I'd suggest you leave the commandant of Gray Raven alone.	1																					
67	67		301								Vera	So we aren't authorized to know about it. Is that what you're saying?	2																					
68	68		301								Vera	Tsk. A boring squad with a commandant like that one.	2																					
69	69		301								Asimov	Don't go yet. I've got something else to tell you.	1																					
70	70		301								Vera	What is it? Have you finally found a commandant for us?	2																					
71	71		301								Asimov	That's right.	1																					
72	72		301								Asimov	...	1																					
73	73		301								Vera	Really?	2																					
74	74		301								Asimov	If the report results are right, you'll soon be able to formally meet a commandant, who can use the remote connection technique "perfectly."	1																					
75	75		301								Vera	Hmph... Haha, great news. Wait, is this an April Fool's joke?	2																					
76	76		301								Asimov	Do I look like someone with such a terrible sense of humor? Get Noctis and 21 back to Babylonia ASAP. You're about to have your final adjustments.	1
