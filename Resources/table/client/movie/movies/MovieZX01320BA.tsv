6	6		302								Yep.	7																						
7	7		301							1	Asimov	Regarding both of the two separated consciousnesses, though minute, they both display stability decrease over time.	1																					
8	8		301							1	Asimov	Whether it's because of the effect of Tenebrion or something else, this kind of continuous decline is not a situation we'd like to see.	1																					
9	9		301							1	Asimov	The only solution we have right now, is to send Camu back to Kamui's frame occasionally, while keeping a close eye on them.	1																					
10	10		301							1	Asimov	We believe this will re-stabilize both consciousnesses.	1

27	999003		301								Asimov	To be honest, I was also surprised at the results of the surgery. Tenebrion might have helped him recover, or not... But well, there he is, now.	1																					
28	27		301							1	Asimov	Then, because he kept nagging the others to get him back to the park, we all decided he should be shoved in the next transport plane and sent over. Any problems that arise, we'll deal with them as they come.	1

76	74		301							1	Asimov	We've indeed considered such an option... But this isn't something that we wish to do.	1																					
77	75		301							1	Asimov	Instead, our recommendation is that you temporarily join Gray Raven and work together with 【kuroname】.	1
