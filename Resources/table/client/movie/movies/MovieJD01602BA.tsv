8	8		302								Lee, can you help?	9																						
9	9		301								Lee	...Yes.	2																					
10	10		301								Lee	Not without risk, though. I can use my computing power to do a brute-force filtering of all the signal sources, but I can't guarantee that I'll be able to filter out all the other interfering signals.	2																					
11	11		301								Lee	What that means is that we'll need to go through multiple rounds of filtering, which is going to take quite some time. I'll leave the choice to you.	2
