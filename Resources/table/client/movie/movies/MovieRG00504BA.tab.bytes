6	6		301								Kamui	The lead actor only had this one movie. An accident took his life during the filming. I was so upset!	1																					
7	7		301								Lee	I wonder what movies you have been watching...	2																					
8	8		201							2	500110		400																					
9	9		301							1	Ayla	Please, just stop talking for now, Mr. Lee. What happened at the end of that movie, Kamui?	2																					
10	10		301								Kamui	Let me think... In the end, the protagonist decided to use the power of the spirits and seek revenge against the local gang who murdered him. He charged into the enemy's building alone, slaughtering them...	1																					
11	11		301								Kamui	Under the revelation of his guardian White Owl, he resurrected and pushed the evil boss off a building!	1

13	13		301							1	Lucia	...Did you miss something in the middle?	2																					
14	14		301								Kamui	Oh, I didn't get to see that part. Someone called him away.	1

16	16		301								Everyone	?																						
17	17		301								Narration	The crowd continues to talk, not knowing danger is imminent.																						
18	18		301								Narration	You notice many people outside the window. You have no idea when it happened, but the local gangsters have already surrounded you.

20	20		201							2	500026		400																					
21	21		301							1	Kamui	Now this isn't what I saw!	1																					
22	22		301								Lee	Things are getting weird. What do we do now?	2																					
23	23		301								Narration	The dark shadows keep getting closer. You can even see the weapons in their hands. There is no way you can leave here in peace.																						
24	24		201							2	500110		400																					
25	25		301							1	Ayla	Kamui, did the movie mention any of the enemy's weaknesses? Or are there bombs planted nearby?	2																					
26	26		301								Kamui	No? The protagonist just beat the bad guys with fist and weapons!	1																					
27	27		302								Whether we rush into the enemy's base...	28																						
28	28		302								Or the enemies rush to us...	29																						
29	29		302								There's no difference, don't you think?	30

33	33		301								Lee	What kind of explanation is that...	2																					
34	34		201							2	500110		400																					
35	35		301							1	Ayla	It does make sense though...	2																					
36	36		302								?																							
37	37		301								Ayla	Either way, we are at the "Devil's Night" now. Next is the rising up, followed by the final battle.	2																					
38	38		301								Ayla	As long as we can complete these two stages, the flow of this movie should still make sense despite the change in the plot. Don't you think?	2																					
39	39		301								Lucia	Looks like you are right...	1																					
40	40		201							1	1081001		-400																					
41	41		301							1	Kamui	Then what are we waiting for? I'll beat them up right now!	1
