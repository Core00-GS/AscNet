249	249		301								Mom	I guess it's because... because it finally hit me that there is only so much I can do, and that I'm just going to keep blundering the harder I try to right the wrongs I caused.	1																					
250	250		301								Mom	And there are just too many things that we can't fix anymore... given how far we've already come.	1																					
251	251		201							1	500510																							
252	252		301							1	Noan	Mom, please...	1																					
253	253		201							1	500519																							
254	254		301							1	Mom	I've stored all the resources in a box that I left under the bed at home, and I've taped the key to the interlayer of one of the drawers in my office desk. They won't last you for long, though, so you need to use them wisely—until Rachel comes back.	1

267	267		201							1	500510																							
268	268		301							1	Noan	Let's apologize to people, Mom. We can start over after that.	1																					
269	269		201							1	500519																							
270	270		301							1	Mom	...I've lost my chance to.	1																					
271	271		301								Mom	I wasn't able to become the person I wanted to be... The only thing I've ever done is compromise with my pathetic self so I could look away from all the things I couldn't accomplish.	1																					
272	272		301								Mom	I thought that would help, but I guess it was all just wishful thinking...	1																					
273	273		301								Mom	See... a single blunder is all that it has to take... for someone to hit the rock bottom of hell.	1																					
274	274		301								Mom	Que sera sera—this is just a fat lie the survivors want you to believe.	1																					
275	275		301									Seeing the guards coming this way from the distance, she lets out a sigh as she picks up her pace of speaking.																						
276	276		301								Mom	Luck, power, courage, knowledge, and wise decisions—these are all the things you need to become a survivor, and that's why it's hard to be one. Now...	1																					
277	277		301								Mom	Noan, I hope you get to grow up and survive the apocalypse... I hope you get to become who you want to be.	1																					
278	278		301								Mom	And... if you still think what I did was wrong many, many years from now, then remember to never do what I did, okay?	1

291	291		301									There are so many things that he hasn't cleared up with his mother, and there are so many things that he wanted to ask—except he's lost his chance forever.																						
292	292		301									In the last 12 short years of Noan's life, they've never once had a heart-to-heart conversation. All the dodging, hiding, and blaming over the years dug a trench so deep in between them—that he never once had a chance to see his mother's true colors.																						
293	293		301									Her past, her aspirations, her worries, her longings—not once was he given a chance to learn about any of these, and it's only now that he finally learns of his mother's love for him for the first time.

320	320		301									The night after, a Cargo Crew member shows up to announce Julie's death.																						
321	321		301									The doctor ruled food poisoning to be the cause of her death, maintaining that she'd consumed expired, rotten food—which is a common cause of death among people living on the lower level.																						
322	322		301									Is that even possible?																						
323	323		301									He stands helplessly among everyone, awash in remorse and guilt. People, however, offer him no constructive answers to his questions. Instead, they shower him—this boy who's been a loner that puts up a tough front—with cold, piercing looks.

329	329		301									Umpteen hours later, he finally comes across an entry that reads "nitrite poisoning"—and a symptom of it is "cyanosis", reminding the boy of his mother's purplish fingers before she died.

338	338		301									They maintain that Julie was working together with some aristocrats and Cargo Crew members, and that, together, they pocketed a sizable amount of resources.																						
339	339		301									And that's as far as they went looking into the case—because Julie died during her trial, which made it impossible for them to find out where the pocketed resources are. Furthermore, the Cargo Crew members that had worked with her all went poof, erasing every last hint that might help.

344	344		301									The boy did try to be as economical as he could with what little food he had, but still found himself reaching the end of it just 15 days after his mother left. Having no other choice, he decides to leave his wooden bed of a "home" to seek help.																						
345	345		301									He comes across quite a few people who, in addition to hating his mother's guts for "having worked with those from the upper level", also despise him—for the mere fact that he's her son.
