5	5		301									She stares at the screen as the game world's time flows. She did her best to reconstruct the elements of this world—for example, the sea breeze that was blowing the sand—based on past records and documents.																						
6	6		301								Ayla	Alright, time to keep working. I was the one who invited them after all.	1																					
7	7		301									As a member of WGAA, Ayla is extremely skilled at creating game worlds.																						
8	8		301								Ayla	Let me summarize their progress first.	1																					
9	9		301								Ayla	Once I consolidate all the players' results, I can design the upcoming changes.	1																					
10	10		301									Ayla clicks open the world archive. The adventure team that spawned in the city is shown on the top.																						
11	11		301								Ayla	Hmm? So these are the players we found earlier on. Good, let me check what's happening over there.	1																					
12	12		301								Ayla	World influence factor is... 17.31?! Amazing. They just started the game and had already done something that could influence the entire kingdom.	1

19	19		301									Numerous pieces of paper fall from above. Soldiers who are riding fantasy creatures are grabbing the paper pieces from baskets and throwing them out.																						
20	20		301									Ayla pauses the screen and zooms in.

48	48		301								Soldier	Alright, we have all the evidence and witnesses. The criminal has confessed to the theft of the artifact. Light them up!

50	50		301								Kamui	Hey! I didn't admit anything!	1																					
51	51		301									Kamui begins to shake his body again, making more squeaking sounds between the ropes and the stake.

53	53		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	Failure, failure, failure, failure...																						
54	54		301								Soldier	Don't move!																						
55	55		301									After wasting all the ropes, the soldier ties Kamui up with a steel chain. He pulls both sides of the chain and kicks the stake hard to tighten him up.																						
56	56		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	DC to break free increased. DC to break free increased. DC to break free increased.																						
57	57		301								Kamui	I don't care! I keep struggling! With all my strength... Wait, why am I the only one that's rolling dice?	1

79	79		301									The moment the soldier walks past the corner...

91	91		301								Soldier	Ahem! The royal family has decided to start the execution early due to poor weather conditions. We don't want the rain to put off their fire.																						
92	92		301									The heated crowd bursts into a deafening cheer, as if throwing stones is not enough to calm their anger. The soldiers holding torches are getting restless.																						
93	93		301								Kamui	We don't even know what your artifact looks like! This makes no sense! I want to appeal!	1																					
94	94		301									Kamui tries to argue, but his futile attempt only stirs up endless insults. The crowd seems to have lost all sanity after hearing their crime.																						
95	95		301								Kamui	Calm down, guys...	1

102	102		301								Soldier	Hey! What are you doing?!																						
103	103		301									Ignoring him, Chrome focuses on breaking away while calculating the escape route.

116	116		301								Karenina	This is WGAA's public project. Ayla asked us to help her finish the script.	1																					
117	117		301								Karenina	Honestly, I'm not good at this. So I had been making weapons at a place.	1																					
118	118		301								Soldier	Who are you?!																						
119	119		301									The soldier throws his torch away as he pulls out a sword. The torch rolls down the road and finally comes to a stop near Kamui.																						
120	120		301									Kamui makes three rolls in a row trying to kick it away, but none succeeded.																						
121	121		301								Kamui	The dice just hate me today, don't they? If that's the case...	2																					
122	122		301								Kamui	Hey you, over there. You dropped something. DM, I want to use Mage Hand to pull that sword close.	2																					
123	123		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	Kamui rolls a... critical failure.																						
124	124		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	You tried to grab the sword's hilt with a magic hand but accidentally sneezed. The hand elegantly sent the sword flying into a crack in the floor.																						
125	125		301									The soldier's nervous look immediately disappears. Infuriated, he grabs Kamui's neck and shakes him rigorously, stating that he just bought the new sword.																						
126	126		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	The soldier rolls a Will check... Critical failure. He jumps over and disappears in the crack, following his sword.

165	165		301									Transparent ice blocks rise from the ground, forming a solid wall, making the soldiers quiver in fear as they fall back. An officer has to shout at them to force them to go back holding their weapons.
