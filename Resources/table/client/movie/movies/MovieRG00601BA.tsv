6	6		301									It sounds like the waves crashing against the cliffside, the unending sound of the tide.																						
7	7		301									You grab ahold of yourself and reorient your consciousness from these stimuli of unknown origins.																						
8	8		301									And then...																						
9	9		301									You suddenly see a small spot of light amidst the eternal darkness.																						
10	10		301									Like a moth to a flame, you desperately want to approach that ethereal light.

33	33		301									You are in a room that you can only describe as "dilapidated."																						
34	34		301									An old wooden bed, cracked and moldy walls, and a ceiling covered in cobwebs form the room. The smell of decay fills the air, offering a hint of how old this abandoned structure is.																						
35	35		301									Strange.																						
36	36		301									It is not just the environment—you are a stranger to yourself as well.

41	41		301									You hear a voice in your heart. Following its calling, you get off the bed.																						
42	42		301									You can see a courtyard surrounded by broken fences through the window. Beyond that is a dense forest.																						
43	43		301									You seem to be in the countryside near a town.																						
44	44		301									You can also hear the faint clashes of the waves hitting the shore. You might be in a coastal area.																						
45	45		301									You step out of the room and walk downstairs.																						
46	46		301									Your movement breaks the long-held silence of this decrepit estate. The sunlight illuminates the dust in the air through the gaps of the thick musky curtains.

55	55		301									Before you finish speaking in your raspy voice, you seem to have caught something in the corners of your eyes.

62	62		302								What... are you doing here?	63

70	70		302								Who are you...?	71	...Why are you waiting for me?	76																				
71	71		301								???	My name is Cradle. Who I am... is a more difficult question to answer.	1

73	73		301								Cradle	"Stop the sound of the tide, and end the eternal cycle..." Only some can accomplish this task, and my duty is to guide these people to the heart of the world.	1

81	81		301								Cradle	You are now on the "Path of the Curse Queller", which is why you woke up in a blank state.	1

83	83		302								...	84																						
84	84		301									The girl named Cradle explains to you after you have forgotten everything.																						
85	85		301									Regrettably, you do not understand anything she just said.																						
86	86		301									The amount of information threatens to suffocate you.																						
87	87		301									Luckily, now you have something to ponder over.																						
88	88		301									Your body functions automatically out of forgotten habits before you realize it, processing Cradle's words over and over again, trying to deduce their meaning.																						
89	89		302								What is the "sound of the tide"?	90																						
90	90		204							1	8																							
91	91		301								Cradle	It is the calamity that threatens to purge the world... It is the tragedy that never ends.	1																					
92	92		301								Cradle	You can hear it, can't you? The surging waves that are echoing in your ears, thumping and wailing.	1																					
93	93		301									Indeed, you have been hearing the sound of the tide from afar since you woke up.																						
94	94		301									But what does that have to do with the "calamity"?																						
95	95		204							1																								
96	96		301								Cradle	You don't seem to comprehend fully.	1

162	162		204							1																								
163	163		301								Cradle	That's right. The great tide surges from the depths of the ocean after a set period of time, devouring all.	1

176	176		204							1																								
177	177		301								Cradle	But the wisdom of the ancients became undecipherable mysteries. People had to start from nothing, slowly repeating what had happened.	1

179	179		301								Cradle	It destroyed the world over and over again as if trying to keep humanity's future locked away.	1

191	191		301								Cradle	In my opinion, however, let's figure out the "how" before the "why."	1																					
192	192		301								Cradle	The calamity is right before us. If we don't want the same tragedy to repeat...	1

210	210		301								Cradle	You can act after you make up your mind. There's no rush.	1
