5	5		301									You do not know where you are. At first, you feel like you are lying down. Then you feel something stand you up. Finally, you feel yourself being carried.																						
6	6		301									Your ears are buzzing. You hear someone crying out periodically, but you can only catch just a few fragmented sentences.

30	30		301									But it does not hurt. It is just a feeling.																						
31	31		301								Construct	【kuroname】 has been seriously injured! Blood-loss critical!																						
32	32		301								Construct	Help! It's an emergency! Where's the doctor?! Any doctor that can operate on humans?!																						
33	33		301									Ngh... Really? You are injured...?																						
34	34		301									Then someone must have treated you and carried you back.																						
35	35		301									You struggle to open your eyes. You catch a glimpse of the gray sky and a mountain of scrapped Constructs.																						
36	36		301								Scavenger Girl	(Whimpers) No... You can't! Don't die!																						
37	37		301									Someone... is calling me.																						
38	38		301								Vera	I guess desperate times call for desperate measures.

54	54		301								Construct	Hey! What'd 【kuroname】 just say?!																						
55	55		301								Construct	I didn't catch it. What was the order?!																						
56	56		301								Construct	That's not important right now... You sure there isn't a single doctor here?!																						
57	57		301								Vera	(Sneers)																						
58	58		301									You feel as if the red-haired Construct who is smiling gently behind the crowd of people gave out a cold sneer.																						
59	59		301								Vera	Alright, make way, you worthless pieces of scrap metal.																						
60	60		301								Vera	I won't allow the commandant to die on my watch. I'm going to need the field clinic for intensive surgery. Everyone else, get out and leave me alone!																						
61	61		301								Construct	W-wait... What do you think you're doing—																						
62	62		301								Vera	Are you deaf? I said LEAVE! Need me to use my weapon?																						
63	63		301								Construct	B-but you're wounded... You need to rest...																						
64	64		301								Vera	Hmph, you're worried about me? HAH! Don't even bother. Anyway, show's over. I don't care what you think of me. You wanna go back and tell everyone how bad of a person I am, by all means.																						
65	65		301								Vera	But if you get in my way, don't be surprised when I use force.																						
66	66		301								Vera	As for this wound, I'm fine as long as I can operate. Hell, it'll even help keep me awake.																						
67	67		301									The red-haired Construct makes her way through the crowd, or rather, the crowd actively clears the way.

73	73		301									Leaning by your face, she whispers in your ear. Her red hair brushes against your cheek.																						
74	74		301								Vera	Well, then. It's your lucky day. I'll heal you right up. It's gonna hurt a bit though...	1
