10	10		301							1	Chrome	Sorry to disturb you at this hour.	1																					
11	11		302								That's fine. You know what kind of "busywork" I'm doing.	12																						
12	12		204							1	1																							
13	13		301									Chrome does not respond to that directly. He gives you a slight smile, and you both understand each other perfectly.																						
14	14		204							1																								
15	15		301								Chrome	Recently, the Task Force has been searching for clues on the Hetero-Hive Mother on the surface.	1																					
16	16		301								Chrome	Do you remember Vonnegut mentioning the Hive Mother in the sewers was just a "test subject"?	1																					
17	17		302								Yeah.	18																						
18	18		301								Chrome	Right. After that, Asimov and I confirmed one thing as we exchanged data, which is that among the Hetero-Hive Mothers exists an advanced being, hidden somewhere on earth, waiting to hatch.	1																					
19	19		301								Chrome	The several Hive Mothers the Task Force found so far are not as developed as the one underneath City 075. Some of them haven't even developed a functional heart.	1																					
20	20		301								Chrome	This discovery also confirmed the idea that the same Hetero-Creature would multiply into multiple beings.	1																					
21	21		301								Chrome	Based on the Polyphage and the Hetero-Hive Mother in the sewers, Ascendants can have a pivotal role in helping the Hetero-Creatures grow.	1																					
22	22		301								Chrome	That undiscovered, advanced subject has Vonnegut aiding its growth, so its level of completion must be second to none.	1																					
23	23		301								Chrome	Which makes locating it a time-sensitive task. There are three reasons I'm looking for you now.	1																					
24	24		301								Chrome	First...	1																					
25	25		302								The specialized frame.	26																						
26	26		301								Chrome	Indeed. We defeated the Hetero-Hive Mother with my Glory frame, which means Lucia, with her specialized frame, is also capable of defeating the same enemy type.	1																					
27	27		301								Chrome	Second...	1																					
28	28		302								The Punishing Virus overloading.	29																						
29	29		301								Chrome	That's right. Since the Hive Mother will overload Inver-Devices with the Punishing Virus, we require a commandant on the scene to stabilize the Constructs to prevent infection.	1																					
30	30		301								Chrome	And the one who has multiple experiences fighting Ascendants and powerful Hetero-Creatures, as well as having connected to Corrupted by Huaxu without being infected is the perfect candidate.	1																					
31	31		302								So you know about what happened in City 075?	32																						
32	32		301								Chrome	Yes, I do. I took advantage of my father's position to gather some information.	1																					
33	33		301									Chrome answers directly. You can tell that he has no intention to use that information against you by how sincere his gaze is.																						
34	34		301								Chrome	Third...	1																					
35	35		302								Gray Raven on the frontline is the best encouragement for the army.	36																						
36	36		301								Chrome	Exactly. The frontline is dangerous, sure, but removing threats on the fiercest battlefield will score Gray Raven another major achievement, further stoking the flame of hope. This also matches what the Parliament wants for your team.	1																					
37	37		302								...	38																						
38	38		302								There's a fourth reason, isn't there?	39																						
39	39		204							1	1																							
40	40		301								Chrome	I knew I can't hide anything from you...	1																					
41	41		302								Is your frame really alright?	42																						
42	42		301								Chrome	It is. And thanks to that experience, we managed to record the abnormal data and confirm our hypothesis on the evolution of the Hive Mother.	1																					
43	43		204							1																								
44	44		301								Chrome	But the Science Council can't rule out that the overload will do further damage to the Glory frame, which is why Strike Hawk has to stay on Babylonia to help with the research on the Hetero-Hive Mother instead of fighting on the field.	1																					
45	45		302								What about Camu?	46																						
46	46		301								Chrome	A Camu who works alone away from Strike Hawk is deemed too dangerous by others.	1																					
47	47		301								Chrome	And given his uniqueness, he will be staying with us and assisting the Science Council on their research for now.	1																					
48	48		302								I see.	49																						
49	49		301								Chrome	In conclusion, I feel like Gray Raven is our best option when it comes to missions that concern the advanced subject.	1																					
50	50		301									Chrome stresses his voice when he says, "Gray Raven is our best option."																						
51	51		302								Thanks.	52																						
52	52		301								Chrome	No worries. I'll wait for you at Asimov's lab.	1

58	58		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Asimov's laboratory is way messier compared to the last time you were here. Different folders and machines are scattered in the space, making it difficult for you to find a place to stand.																						
59	59		301									Asimov is focusing on the report in his hands, quickly tapping on the keyboard when he thinks of something before returning to the papers.																						
60	60		301									A researcher is standing by his side, looking at Chrome and you by the door.																						
61	61		201							1	500023																							
62	62		301							1	Researcher	Please come in, Chrome and 【kuroname】. Turn left for 30 degrees and take 2 steps forward. That is the area Mr. Asimov has provided you to stand.	1																					
63	63		302								Where are the others?	64																						
64	64		301								Researcher	They left after delivering their reports. You two are the last ones.	1																					
65	65		301								Researcher	First, allow me to explain the current situation on behalf of Mr. Asimov once again.	1																					
66	66		301								Researcher	The Science Council's current research requires a large amount of Punishing Virus samples. With sufficient samples, the research progress can advance by 40%.	1																					
67	67		301								Researcher	But not any samples. The higher the strength of the sample, the more accurate the data it provides.	1																					
68	68		301								Researcher	Among Corrupted, Hetero-Creatures, and Ascendants, Hetero-Creatures are best-suited to study, given that it evolves from the Punishing Virus itself.	1																					
69	69		301								Researcher	Among the Hetero-Creatures, highly-developed entities like the Polyphage, Siren, and the Hetero-Hive Mother are the most ideal samples.	1																					
70	70		301								Researcher	Chrome has already told you about the advanced Hetero-Hive Mother.	1																					
71	71		301								Researcher	Currently, we have discovered and destroyed several Hive Mothers that developed naturally, but their completion rate cannot compare to the one found in the sewers.	1																					
72	72		301								Researcher	So we hypothesize that the Hetero-Hive Mother aided by Vonnegut is most likely the purest being made with the Punishing Virus.	1																					
73	73		301								Researcher	Now, let's exchange information to locate the advanced subject out there.	1																					
74	74		202							1					1																			
75	75		401							2	558																							
76	76		301									The researcher swipes across the air before him, and a large projection of Earth appears in the middle of the laboratory.																						
77	77		301									Chrome reaches out and touches a spot on the globe, asking.																						
78	78		201							1	500309																							
79	79		301							1	Chrome	This is where the sewers underneath City 075 are.	1																					
80	80		301								Chrome	There were two known factors. Data of Luna at her prime, recorded by Ouroboros, and the time difference between Strike Hawk's first retreat from the sewers and our second return there when we ran into Vonnegut.	1																					
81	81		301								Chrome	If Vonnegut had moved outside during this time frame, the furthest he could have traveled, given these two factors, would be within this area.	1																					
82	82		301									Chrome draws a circle on the globe as he says that.																						
83	83		301								Chrome	Although we couldn't guarantee that he had left for where the advanced subject was...	1																					
84	84		301								Chrome	But, if—	1																					
85	85		301									Chrome pauses for a second, hesitating before he continues.																						
86	86		302								?	87																						
87	87		301								Chrome	If I were him, I would go to confirm the state of that Hive Mother during this period of time.	1																					
88	88		301								Chrome	Although this was only my subjective estimation, we couldn't ignore the faintest possibility.	1																					
89	89		301								Chrome	And so Strike Hawk began to search for data related to Vonnegut on the surface, and we eventually discovered some of his unique signals recently.	1																					
90	90		301								Chrome	Afterward, we searched outward with the sewers as the center, before we finally came upon matches to his signals in these directions.	1																					
91	91		301									The circle on the globe gets smaller and turns into a few thin lines, displaying the directions Chrome has mentioned.																						
92	92		302								But this is based on a hypothesis.	93																						
93	93		201							1	500004																							
94	94		301							1	Asimov	That's fair, but it's not without its value. Science, after all, is the process to confirm a hypothesis.	1																					
95	95		202							1					1																			
96	96		301									Asimov says it out of nowhere, his gaze having not moved from his monitor.																						
97	97		201							1	500058																							
98	98		301							1	Researcher	Here is the intel the Science Council has organized—	1																					
99	99		301								Researcher	After analyzing the Hetero-Hive Mother, although we can't determine the principle on which it is formed, we can confirm several of its features.	1																					
100	100		301								Researcher	Abnormally energized Punishing Virus concentration and interference on the magnetic field nearby.	1																					
101	101		301								Researcher	Not only does that interference affect communication, but it could also even affect the surrounding environment.	1																					
102	102		302								...	103																						
103	103		301									The things the researcher is listing match the anomalies you have been encountering on the surface.																						
104	104		301								Researcher	If we can discover the exact coordinates of these anomalies on the surface, we will be able to narrow down the possible locations of the completed Hive Mother after combining that data with Chrome's circle.	1																					
105	105		201							1	500309																							
106	106		301							1	Chrome	Right. Now we just need to have the Task Force find those coordinates.	1

113	114		301									Their words have connected all the dots among the different anomalies you have encountered recently.																						
114	113		302								No wonder I felt like I was missing something.	115																						
115	115		301									The anomalies that have been happening all across the globe are no accidents. A new storm is brewing.

128	128		302								About 41 to 42 degrees.	129

143	143		301								Celica	19% of the cities are found freed from Corrupted activities despite not being reclaimed by us. It's believed that the Forsaken has managed to take them.	2																					
144	144		301								Celica	36 conservation areas have been constructed this month, and the preparation work to receive the nearby Scavengers is ongoing.	2																					
145	145		301								Hassen	Good.	1																					
146	146		202							1	2				1																			
147	147		301									Hassen stares at the projection of Earth before him, silent. More dots have lit up, meaning more conservation areas have been built. Babylonia's support has formed a network, linking the different areas to it, connecting humanity again.																						
148	148		301									With this network, cities are restored, and bases are reclaimed.

157	157		301								Hassen	Right. The coordinates point to the ruin of Pulia Forest Park, an area not prioritized for restoration due to the terrain and resource distribution. Having not been reclaimed, the existence of an advanced subject is possible.	1																					
158	158		301								Hassen	Woodcock was the closest to the Forest Park, so they have been sent there to confirm.	1																					
159	159		301								Nikola	That's why you agree with Gray Raven's application to move back to the frontline?	2
