15	15		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The logistics department is already cleaning up the reactor site.																						
16	16		301									There is debris everywhere, but no signs of burning near the reactor.																						
17	17		301									This is not surprising, considering that a zero-point reactor does not rely on the "primitive" combustion reaction to release its energy.																						
18	18		301									Lustrous immediately arrives at the scene. She seems to be totally untouched by the disaster and begins asking questions.

21	21		301							1	Lustrous	How's the situation?	1																					
22	22		301								Logistics Staff	The disaster prevention system was activated in the first moment to cut off the power supply and isolate the radioactive beams. All facilities and personnel above the reactor level remain unharmed.	2																					
23	23		301								Lustrous	How many casualties?	1																					
24	24		301								Logistics Staff	Two deaths, one seriously injured, fifteen lightly injured. The medical department has taken over the injuries.	2																					
25	25		301								Lustrous	Get the robotics department here to investigate, then upgrade the disaster prevention equipment.	1																					
26	26		301								Lustrous	Who was in charge of the experiment?	1																					
27	27		301								Logistics Staff	It's Lybia from the research department.	2																					
28	28		301								Lustrous	Remove her from the position, then send her back to land in the next supply ship.	1																					
29	29		301								Logistics Staff	Um...	2																					
30	30		301								Lustrous	Is there a problem?	1																					
31	31		301								Logistics Staff	She's the seriously injured one. I'm afraid she won't last long.	2																					
32	32		301								Lustrous	...	1																					
33	33		301								Logistics Staff	Would you like to see her, ma'am?	2																					
34	34		204							1	3																							
35	35		301									Lustrous closes her eyes.																						
36	36		301								Lustrous	I have no interest in fools, but she doesn't deserve to die of stupidity. Make sure the medical department does all they can.	1

40	40		301								Logistics Staff	Hello? Yes... She's here. I will let her know.	2																					
41	41		301								Logistics Staff	Ma'am, it's from the medical department. Lybia has passed.	2																					
42	42		301								Lustrous	Why bother me with such news? The admin team will handle the compensation and the funeral.	1																					
43	43		301								Logistics Staff	Lybia was pregnant. The medical team couldn't save her, but managed to keep her baby alive. They want to know what they should do with the baby. We have never had a newborn here...	2																					
44	44		301								Lustrous	Why is there a pregnant staff on the island?	1																					
45	45		301								Logistics Staff	Lybia was supposed to return to the land with the last supply ship, but she couldn't leave her ongoing research until her due date was close... As far as I can recall, you approved her stay.	2

55	55		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The light in the corridor of the medical department is extremely pale and bright. It seems even the shadows have faded a bit.																						
56	56		301									The ward is divided by a green curtain. On the bed in front of Lustrous lies a small, curled-up infant. Another bed is barely visible behind the curtain with a lifeless figure lying on top of it.																						
57	57		301									Lustrous frowns.																						
58	58		301								Lustrous	What is this, a monkey? Where's Lybia's child?																						
59	59		301								Medical Director	Ma'am, this is her child. It's a girl.																						
60	60		301								Lustrous	...																						
61	61		301								Lustrous	I'm not familiar with physiology. Is this what a normal baby should look like?																						
62	62		301								Medical Director	No. The lower half of her body was crushed in the accident, possibly due to the explosion. We gave her basic first-aid treatment, but...																						
63	63		301								Lustrous	How can we cure her?																						
64	64		301								Medical Director	I'm afraid we can't, ma'am. We did everything we could to save a premature newborn from death.																						
65	65		301								Medical Director	Honestly, I think it is a miracle that she is still alive.																						
66	66		301									Lustrous lifts her eyes to glance at Lybia's body under the green cloth. She frowns.																						
67	67		301								Lustrous	Is it a common thing that the mother has died but the baby is still alive?																						
68	68		301								Medical Director	It happened a lot in the old days. Back then, women could possibly die from excessive bleeding during obstructed labor. But modern medical science can save almost all the mothers nowadays.																						
69	69		301								Lustrous	What's with this child then?																						
70	70		301								Medical Director	It was pretty incredible. Lybia had a contraction on the brink of death. She was almost passing out, but she seemed to be determined to have the baby born... And she sort of succeeded. Well, it was us who took the baby out of her broken abdomen eventually.																						
71	71		301								Lustrous	...Is this a result of the so-called "maternal bond"?																						
72	72		301								Medical Director	I don't know. But I remember a story I once read. A pregnant woman had her head cut off in a car accident, but her body managed to give birth to a healthy baby on the spot.																						
73	73		301								Lustrous	...																						
74	74		301								Lustrous	When are the supply ships arriving? Send her back to the land with the next shipment.																						
75	75		301								Medical Director	I'm afraid we can't do it anytime soon. The "Submergence Day" is just around the corner...																						
76	76		301									Lustrous frowns again.																						
77	77		301								Lustrous	Just keep her for now.																						
78	78		301								Medical Director	Would you like to give her a name?																						
79	79		301								Lustrous	Whatever, just give her a code. Don't waste my time with such trivial matters. Names are but an identifier.																						
80	80		301								Medical Director	...																						
81	81		301								Lustrous	...																						
82	82		301									Lustrous lets out a sigh after a long time, as if she is making a compromise.																						
83	83		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lustrous	Her mother's name is Lybia. Let's just call her Lamia then.
