6	6		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
7	7		301									He had a blackout. After his ears stopped ringing, he began to moan in pain. For one moment, he thought he was already dead. Would it be better to die from falling as a deserter than dying on the battlefield as a hero? He didn't know.																						
8	8		301									While unconscious, he feels like someone is grabbing his shoulders and pulling his body.

12	12		301							1		Still dizzy, Yarha opens his eyes and sees a white figure. She looks like an innocent white soul on the battlefield.																						
13	13		201							1	500408	19																						
14	14		301							1	Yarha	I'm dead... I'm going to die...	1																					
15	15		301									He starts to sob. Knowing that he will never see the stars again, fear has taken hold of him.

18	18		301							1	??	Don't worry. Relax.	2																					
19	19		301								Yarha	...Liv? Is that you?	1																					
20	20		301								Medic	It's me. Yarha, I need you to relax. I have compressed your wound. Next, I'm going to wrap it up.	2																					
21	21		301								Yarha	I... defected... Am I... going to die?	1																					
22	22		204							2	5																							
23	23		301								Medic	...You are not going to die here, soldier...	2																					
24	24		202							1	2				1																			
25	25		301									Yarha is still dizzy, but he has heard her reply, as well as the unique crisp and heavy footsteps of Corrupted.																						
26	26		301									He asks himself if he still wants to live. But what can he possibly do even if he does? What punishment awaits him after he returns to the army as a deserter?																						
27	27		301									Is a coward like him... worthy to live on?																						
28	28		301									Yarha's body is getting heavy. His mind turns numb. Despair has taken over the fear of death.																						
29	29		301									He fumbles around, finally pulling out his gun.																						
30	30		201							1	500408	19																						
31	31		301							1	Yarha	I have one last bullet in my gun...	1																					
32	32		301									He took the gun with him and fired at Corrupted on his way, but none of the bullets landed so he could only keep running.																						
33	33		301								Yarha	I kept it... for myself...	1																					
34	34		301								Yarha	You should go.	1																					
35	35		202							1					1																			
36	36		301									Yarha tries to raise his hand, but can't even lift up the gun due to fear and injury. It falls to the side.																						
37	37		301									A cold liquid is washing his painful body. Liv didn't leave, but kept giving him emergency treatment instead.

39	39		201							2	500402	5	450																					
40	40		301							1	Medic	The last bullet should be kept for the enemy, not yourself.	2																					
41	41		301								Yarha	Hah... What can I do with just one bullet...?	1																					
42	42		301								Medic	Alright, the wound on your head isn't too bad, but don't move your legs too much.	2																					
43	43		301									The medic finishes treating his wounds. She kneels next to him, looking him in the eye.																						
44	44		301								Medic	You aren't the only one injured here. I will not leave you behind.	2																					
45	45		301									Yarha realizes there are other wounded soldiers lying next to him. This medic has saved them all...																						
46	46		301								Medic	As for the approaching Corrupted...	2																					
47	47		301									She puts the gun back into Yarha's hand again.																						
48	48		301								Medic	Its model is Domestic Gardener M-62, and is already significantly damaged. Its action module is located right behind the panel on its chest. If the module is shot, all its action logic will be disabled, and it won't attract any other Corrupted either.	2																					
49	49		301								Yarha	Are you... asking me to shoot it?	1																					
50	50		301								Medic	If you still want to keep going... That's the only way.	2																					
51	51		202							1	2				1																			
52	52		301									Yarha is trembling, but he doesn't have much time to hesitate. He takes a deep breath in, slowly lifts his gun, and tries to focus on it.																						
53	53		401							2	1510																							
54	54		301									Aim, fire.																						
55	55		401							2	1508																							
56	56		301									Sparks come out of the Corrupted's chest as it stumbles. Its mechanical body begins to tremble fiercely, and all its slim limbs are wiggling abnormally. After what feels like a century, it finally waddles in another direction.																						
57	57		301									Cold sweat races down Yarha's head, but he feels relieved inside. It is the first time that he solved a crisis entirely on his own.																						
58	58		201							1	500402	2																						
59	59		301							1		He turns to the medic. The white-haired girl makes a relieved smile.																						
60	60		301									Yarha's vision blurs. Her pale smile disappears as Yarha's mind is pulled back to the cold reality. He stares at the screen.

70	70		301									A pure-white frame is slowly spinning around on the holographic screen. There is a lot of data flowing next to it.																						
71	71		401							2	1515																							
72	72		301									Yarha lifts his hand and swipes the data with a finger, sending them into the icon of a file. He then opens Kurono's internal comms channel.																						
73	73		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					He taps "send", just like how he lightly pulled the trigger back then.
