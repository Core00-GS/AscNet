4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Karenina	All the weird stuff I said before... Just pretend that never happened.	1																					
5	5		302								I wanted to answer you.	6	That might be a bit hard.	6																				
6	6		301								Karenina	There are many things I don't like about this squad, but what I don't like most is you...	1																					
7	7		302								Well, that came out of the blue.	8	I didn't say anything to make you mad, did I?	9																				
8	8	10	301								Karenina	Well, I always speak my mind.	1																					
9	9		301								Karenina	You make me so mad!	1																					
10	10		301								Karenina	You're just an ordinary commandant, but you always do the impossible.	1																					
11	11		301								Karenina	You always have the silliest tactics, but they always work out as expected.	1																					
12	12		301								Karenina	You don't have our combat ability, yet you're stronger than all of us...	1																					
13	13		302								Sounds like that's a compliment.	14	Sorry...?	14																				
14	14		301								Karenina	And you have such a contagious attitude!	1																					
15	15		301								Karenina	That's why I don't like you. Put simply, I can't stand anything about you.	1																					
16	16		301								Karenina	I can't stand your undying optimism!	1																					
17	17		301								Karenina	I can't stand that you treat everyone fairly!	1																					
18	18		301								Karenina	I can't stand that... you always bond with other Constructs!	1																					
19	19		301								Karenina	Am I not strong enough? Or do you think I'm...	1																					
20	20		301								Karenina	...I'm gonna go back to base.	1																					
21	21		302								You're my friend, Karenina.	22	Let's go back together then.	24																				
22	22		301								Karenina	Huh...?	1																					
23	23		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Karenina	W-what kind of weird thing is that to say?	1																					
24	24		301								Karenina	Together...?	1																					
25	25		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Karenina	I hope one day, we can truly be together.	1
