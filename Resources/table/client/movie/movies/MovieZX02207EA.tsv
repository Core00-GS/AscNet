30	30		301							1		Above the Red Tide are static Corrupted frozen in place, scarlet liquid spilling out from the gaps of their bodies.

34	34		301									The Hetero-Sapiens, originally thought to only appear in Pulai Forest Park Ruins, are rising from the Red Tides in the video.																						
35	35		301									They step away from the tide and attack everything on their way, and the reaction from the ones attacked is all but unfamiliar.																						
36	36		301								Lucia	This is... the Red Tide...																						
37	37		301									In the footage, the victims' bodies break up after being attacked by the Hetero-Sapiens, falling to the ground, before dissolving and reforming by the Hetero-Sapiens' strikes, regardless if they are mechanoids or humans.

47	47		301								Hassen	Hetero-Creatures, as a product of the Punishing Virus, are rising from mechanoids that have been infected.	1																					
48	48		301								Hassen	They form small-scale Red Tides everywhere with Corrupted activities, breaking down machines and attacking humans, rapidly raising the virus concentration in the area, and turning more and more areas into Dead Zones.	1																					
49	49		301								Hassen	Based on our observation, the global Punishing Virus concentration is rising exponentially.	1

53	53		201							1	500286																							
54	54		301							1	Hans	Technically, some areas were cleared of the Red Tide.	1																					
55	55		301								Hans	We never understood how the Red Tide appeared. We only knew that it'd show up near a powerful Hetero-Creature, which was why Babylonia could tackle the Red Tide problem by taking down the Polyphage and Siren.	1

58	58		301							1	Hassen	The Red Tides now are different from the one in City 075. They appear within the Corrupted and spread with the help of Hetero-Sapiens. They move faster, hit harder, and mobilize more freely. It's a new threat to humanity.	1																					
59	59		301								Hassen	Babylonia is actively preparing a response for it. All Task Force members, remember your duties as a soldier. Hold your position, protect the civilians, and wait for our notice.	1

65	65		301							1	Hans	This is a warning to humanity, telling us not to let our guard down because of momentary victories.	1

70	70		301								Hans	That's why we can't stop as well. Like the President said, our duties come first. What we should do now is hold our positions and complete our missions.	1
