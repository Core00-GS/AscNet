5	5		301									After Golden Jegan was defeated, he took out the artifact fragment that he had been protecting just like other Demon Generals. This was probably a system setting.	1

9	7		301									The Demon General closed his eyes, but Lucia pulled her blade back.																						
10	8		301								Golden Jegan	Um, aren't you going to finish me off?	1																					
11	9		301								Lucia	Like I said, I didn't want to use violence. Plus, there's still something we want to know from you.	2																					
12	10		301								Golden Jegan	Hmph. As heroes of revelation, you are quite different...	1																					
13	11		301								Lucia	Just like Karenina said... Have you been watching us all along?	2																					
14	12		301								Golden Jegan	Of course... That's why I also know who you are looking for.	1																					
15	1003		302								Do you mean Liv?	13	Is she nearby?	14																				
16	13	1004	301								Golden Jegan	Indeed... That's how His Majesty calls her.	1																					
17	14	1004	301								Golden Jegan	She's further away, with His Majesty. They didn't go past here.	1																					
18	1004		201							2	500173		-400																					
19	15		301							1	Lee	Wait a sec. Are you suggesting Liv is with the Demon King?	2																					
20	16		301								Golden Jegan	Correct. She met His Majesty ever since she arrived in this world, and they have been moving together.	1

23	17		301							1	Kamui	...But the stone monument said the Demon King was already killed by the heroes. Did he come back to life again?	1																					
24	1007		201							1	500101																							
25	18		301							1	Golden Jegan	Before the last Demon King was destroyed, he separated a small potion of his power, which became the Demon King now...	1																					
26	19		301								Golden Jegan	He also realized his mistake and asked us to never harm humans again. But we never thought the humans would come at us this time.	1																					
27	20		301								Golden Jegan	So he decided to start his plan after you arrived here...	1

30	21		301							1	Lee	You call Liv the Holy Maiden. Does she have anything to do with that plan?	2																					
31	22		301								Golden Jegan	Of course... Only she can save us Demons.	1																					
32	23		301								Golden Jegan	And this world.	1																					
33	1010		302								How can she save you?	24	Where are they now?	25																				
34	24	1011	301								Golden Jegan	By going to the Demon King's Castle.	1																					
35	25	1011	301								Golden Jegan	On their way to the Demon King's Castle.	1

41	27		301							1	Karenina	But the gate can only be opened after all artifact fragments are collected!	2																					
42	1015		201							1	500101		400																					
43	28		301							1	Golden Jegan	It's called the "Demon King's Castle." Do you think a castle will not respond to its owner?	1																					
44	29		301								Golden Jegan	Not to mention the Goddess' artifact was originally... Wait, what's this...?	1																					
45	30		301								Karenina	What's wrong?	2																					
46	31		301									The conversation was interrupted as Golden Jegan became very anxious. He looked very shocked, then started to panic.																						
47	32		301								Golden Jegan	Heroes from afar, I am going to use my magic to launch the artifact away. Please follow it.	1																					
48	33		301								Karenina	Hah? Are you eating your words already?	2																					
49	34		301								Golden Jegan	No, but His Majesty and the Holy Maiden are in danger. As a Demon General, I cannot go out!	1																					
50	35		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Golden Jegan	Please, go help them!	1
