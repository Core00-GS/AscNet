6	6		301							1	Aston	...Emergency repair of the 11 functional carriages is complete. Train operation is back to normal. All damage is within the expected level.	1																					
7	7		301								Aston	A scan of the remains of Rail Heterozygote has been done. We found a higher than expected Punishing reaction level, but no trace of He-4.	1

11	11		301								Aston	Understood.	1																					
12	12		301								Jamilah	Is Sophia "guarding" the goods?	2																					
13	13		204							1	8																							
14	14		301								Aston	Yes. She's with the real one.	1

22	21		301							1	Aston	The credo for merchants. That's what you have always taught Sophia.	1																					
23	22		204							2	4																							
24	23		301								Jamilah	I also taught her to be honest in trade.	2																					
25	24		204							1	8																							
26	25		301								Aston	Yes. All I can say is, you have always been right.	1

29	28		301								Jamilah	All that business talk... You know how boring it is, Aston.	2

32	31		301								Aston	So you reward sincerity with sincerity and repay trickery with trickery. Everything's under your control, at least before the real trade.	1																					
33	32		301								Aston	"Pick the fine goods and get rid of the bad ones." This is the order you have given.	1																					
34	33		301								Aston	This "trade" has completely separated those aristocrats behind Ashlar from the rest.	1																					
35	34		204							1	8																							
36	35		301								Aston	They are probably hiding in one of the carriages with their treasures.	1																					
37	36		204							1	4																							
38	37		301								Aston	As you expected, only when on the cusp of death will this group of hereditary slicks shows their true face and attitude.	1

42	41		204							1																								
43	42		301								Aston	..."Trust." It was all part of Amir's plan, to leave the "kids" and "merchants" behind.	1																					
44	43		204							2	1																							
45	1001		301								Jamilah	Kids and merchants are similar in a way. Sincerity is a very rare quality, Aston.	2																					
46	44		301								Jamilah	"Every problem can be talked through." Kids believe in this, and so do merchants.	2																					
47	1002		204							2																								
48	45		301								Aston	You are always right.	1																					
49	46		204							2	4																							
50	47		301								Jamilah	This is a show, but with genuine supporters. Sincerity begets sincerity. A merchant should have a keen perception. Sophia's a smart kid, she's been growing.	2																					
51	48		301								Jamilah	She's mastered everything that she couldn't learn in this carriage.	2																					
52	49		301								Aston	You and Sophia...	1																					
53	50		301								Aston	Pardon me, Amir, but you don't have to pay for your predecessor's mistake...	1																					
54	51		301								Jamilah	It's not a "mistake." Aston, you should know what you can and cannot say.	2																					
55	52		301								Aston	You were only favored by fate.	1																					
56	53		204							2	1																							
57	54		301								Jamilah	The God of Fate never favors... Aston, so-called eternity does not exist.	2																					
58	55		204							2	4

63	60		301							1	Jamilah	As long as the world keeps turning, everything will eventually return to where it started.	2																					
64	61		301								Jamilah	If one can't see the end, it's only because the road is under their feet.	2																					
65	62		204							2	1																							
66	63		301								Jamilah	The real destination in Sophia's heart... will be her new starting point.	2

68	65		301								Jamilah	Time to deliver the goods. The false trade is completed. Time for the real one, Aston.	2
