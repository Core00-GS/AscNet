4	4		301			DialogEnable					HNB1	When I went to look for food, I went into a food processing plant.																						
5	5		301								HNB1	There's something off about the factory. It's empty, but it's still operating.																						
6	6		301								HNB1	I climbed over a noise barrier and entered the factory. The noise from the machines was deafening.																						
7	7		301								HNB1	Countless Tai'E and Guardians were hanging on the production line and moving along a huge machine.																						
8	8		301								HNB1	They were pulverized and flattened into scrap metal on the work bed.																						
9	9		301								HBG3	That's the right decision.

11	11		301								HNB1	I know that.																						
12	12		301								HBG3	Robots obey orders. The highest command of Tai'E is to protect mankind. All Tai'E are the sameâ€”simple and easy to understand.																						
13	13		301								HBG3	But you have always been different. I never know what you're going to do.																						
14	14		301								HBG3	I never hated you. I'm not installed with an emotion module, so I can't like or hate.																						
15	15		301								HBG3	I just feel... unaccustomed around you, and confused.																						
16	16		301								HNB1	G3... Sorry. For a moment, I wavered and had doubts about the point of my existence in the world.																						
17	17		301								HNB1	I feel that there is malice and confrontation in this world.																						
18	18		301								HNB1	But I have also felt that... humans... are full of goodwill and are worthy of protection.																						
19	19		301									So this time, I'm not executing orders because of my programming.																						
20	20		301									But because I want to. That's why I chose this human. Because this human being is special to me...
