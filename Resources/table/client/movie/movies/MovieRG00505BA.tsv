12	12		301								Tom	Alright, trick or treat!	1																					
13	13		301								Narration	The kid said the same line again in a natural and childish way.																						
14	14		301								Narration	Looks like he won't easily give up if you don't give him some candy.																						
15	15		302								Alright, you wait right here.	16	How about I give you 5 Black Cards, and you buy it yourself?	17																				
16	16	18	301								Tom	Okay.	1																					
17	17		301								Tom	What's that "Black Card" thingy? I want real money!	1

25	25		301									"Don't open the door."																						
26	26		301								Narration	But it's too late. The door is already open.																						
27	27		301								Narration	Outside the door is a creepy, gigantic shadow. It is so large that it can cover the entire door.

31	30		301								Narration	The shadow walks toward you, mumbling something that you cannot understand. You can't help but take a few steps back.																						
32	31		301								Narration	The shadow follows you into the room. You don't have much space left.																						
33	32		302								(Try to throw something at it)	33	(Keep moving back)	33

57	55		301								Lee	What...? Oh, I see.	1																					
58	56		301								Shop Owner	You're lucky that you can still use it. Otherwise, Lil' Tom won't get his candies.	2

89	85		301								Lee	Something isn't right with this town.	3
