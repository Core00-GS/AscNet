23	23		301									After they left the artifact chamber, someone soon found out that the artifact component was stolen.																						
24	24		301									The disappeared city guards were also found, making the situation even worse for the two of them.

33	33		301								Curious Man	I heard after the expedition army went out, monsters had come south and infiltrated the defense. They began to appear outside the city in groups.

38	38		301								Teddy	The rendezvous point is Stagnant Valley, the only path toward where the Realm of Dragons is located.	2																					
39	39		301								Karenina	I remember that name. There are hardly any living things near that valley, as if the world has stopped moving around it.	1																					
40	40		301								Karenina	Usually, monsters would also follow certain rules during migration. They can't deal with human towns...	1																					
41	41		301								Teddy	Since they cannot find enough food near Stagnant Valley, there is a high chance that...	2																					
42	42		301								Karenina	The monsters will keep going south, bringing doom to anyone who attempts to search for the Realm of Dragons.	1																					
43	43		301								Teddy	I think now is the time for some emotional plot. Like, somebody is going to sacrifice themselves.	2

92	92		301									Karenina suddenly shows up behind a rock and enters the communication.																						
93	93		301									Seeing Kamui is already geared up for battle, she just stands in front of everyone and throws you a box she took from the artifact chamber.

111	111		301							1	Teddy	If I recall correctly, the probability to observe the Realm of Dragons fluctuates over time. Now is the best opportunity. We cannot guarantee the probability will not rapidly decline later.	2																					
112	112		301							1	Chrome	I believe we should focus on existing resources first before striving for things beyond our control. We should follow this principle to allocate manpower when the situation is still largely unknown.	3

131	131		301								Karenina	C'mon! I just can't talk sense into you. Protection mission? What do you think we are, useless weaklings? Stop excluding us! We are the Engineering Force! Engineering "Force"!	1																					
132	132		301								Karenina	We are the Engineering Force! We are fully trained for combat and do not need your extra "protection"!	1																					
133	133		301								Kamui	You are the one who's excluding us. Sacrificing yourselves for the sake of us? Are you insane?	2

163	163		301									Her gentle smile smooths out the tension like the morning sun.

205	205		201							1	500494	13																						
206	206		301							1	Karenina	The decision is made. Gray Raven will move on to look for the target location. The Engineering Force and Strike Hawk will stay here to distract the incoming enemies.	1																					
207	207		301									Just as you expected, the problem was resolved in no time once they had said it out. After all, you are comrades. The only thing is...																						
208	208		302								I suggest we take care of the interception...	209

210	210		301							1	Teddy	Wow, you're awake! I thought our renowned Gray Raven Commandant had fallen asleep. Should I tell others that you were just watching them argue while doing nothing?	1																					
211	211		301								Teddy	Roll Intimidate.	1																					
212	212		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	Automatic success.																						
213	213		301								Teddy	There you go. Don't forget to tell us what you see in the Realm of Dragons when you return. I'm quite curious.	1

221	221		202							1					1																			
222	222		301									He looks at the direction that Karenina came from and sees lots of dust. Knights in shiny armor are holding their weapons up and inspecting the surroundings.

224	224		201							2	500495		400																					
225	225		301							1	Teddy	They probably are now... Thanks to someone who blew a hole in the city gate, I won't be surprised if they come all the way here.	2																					
226	226		301								Karenina	Great timing, isn't it? Now we can hold off the monsters together...	1

232	232		301									The familiar tone interrupts Karenina. Teddy immediately opens her terminal and displays the message on the screen.																						
233	233		301									Unlike Ayla's description, this text is very short.																						
234	234		301									It tells the same message to all the troops still in the surface Conservation Area—the Holiday is over.																						
235	235		201							1	500494	13																						
236	236		301								Teddy	Okay, I guess we have to call it a day?	1

238	238		301									The players quickly check their own equipment and adjust their mindset. To them, this is not a rare experience.																						
239	239		301									Unlike the world in Ayla's script, they are about to plan and engage in real battle.

243	243		301							1	Karenina	I think we just have to leave the Realm of Dragons to Gray Raven. As for the incoming meeting... Captain Chrome, considering the lack of manpower in the Conservation Area, you shouldn't rule us out again.	1																					
244	244		301								Chrome	Sure, it should be a lot easier with the Engineering Force joining us. Speaking of which, Teddy, can you take care of the heavy arms? We didn't have enough number to use them.	3																					
245	245		301								Teddy	Sure, just some easy target shooting practice. I'm even thinking of writing them a simple program. With the CPF around us, there is no risk of contamination.	2																					
246	246		301								Chrome	As for you, Karenina, the Scire frame will be our trump card. I will propose in the meeting that you come with us to the frontline.	3																					
247	247		301								Karenina	No problem. We will fight shoulder to shoulder, just like always.	1																					
248	248		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Chrome	Yeah, just like always... Let's go.	3
