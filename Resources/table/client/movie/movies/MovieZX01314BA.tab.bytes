9	9		301								Camu	I'm now in... I don't even know where I am.																						
10	10		301								Camu	I think I have a hatch to the surface here before me, but it ain't budging from my end.

12	999001		301							1	Karenina	I have an idea.	1																					
13	999002		301								Karenina	I just pulled the building standard reference of Venus Splash Park from the Ferris wheel terminal. I've roughly figured out the design system this whole place runs on.	1																					
14	12		301								Karenina	According to the reference, the hatches in this area are all installed on the ground end of the rotating mechanism. They have pyrotechnic fasteners for emergency activation.	1

18	15		301							1	Karenina	This kinda run-of-the-mill control system should a cakewalk for you to crack, yeah?	1

23	20		301							1	Karenina	Alright then! Access the network through the signature code I just sent you, and hack into the control system...	2																					
24	21		301								Lee	Done.	1																					
25	22		301								Karenina	Yo, that's pretty quick! Nice job, Lee!	2																					
26	23		301								Karenina	Okay, now we'll just have to input a manual overload command here...	2

28	25		301									You hear alarm bells ring in the park, followed by a dull explosion.																						
29	26		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Karenina	The hatch should be blown open. What's left is... to hope that we blew open the right one.	2
