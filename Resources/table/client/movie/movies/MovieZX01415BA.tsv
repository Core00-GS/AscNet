14	8		301									On the snowy field, the bionics exchange blows with the ARU. The ravage beasts charge incessantly in an attempt to rip apart the joint army of Babylonia and the ARU.																						
15	9		301									However, the ARU remains unbroken. On the contrary, their forces became more united under Simon's command.																						
16	10		301									Everyone is fighting as one. Even though Simon's tactical decisions are old-fashioned in Babylonia terms, they proved highly effective against the scattered bionics.

20	12		301								Simon	I wouldn't be so optimistic...	1

22	1008		204							1	10																							
23	14		301								Simon	The drawn out battle will exhaust the meat-and-bones ARU members, and the Constructs from Babylonia can't keep up for long due to M.I.N.D. exhaustion from combat.	1																					
24	15		301								Simon	If only I were as good at M.I.N.D. calibration like Boss...	1																					
25	16		301									Simon's pace of speech and breath quickens hastily as he speaks.

39	25		301							1	Amberia (Atiel)	Cough... Ugh! Ahhhhh!	1																					
40	26		301			RImgBg1Shake						The tremors grow within the chamber as the energy transfer continues.

42	27		301							1	Rosetta	Argh... My M.I.N.D...	1																					
43	28		301			RImgBg1Shake						Rosetta falls and kneels uncontrollably with Atiel's anguished scream. Her light wings deactivate, and her weapons slink out of her hand, landing on the floor with a series of metallic clinks.																						
44	1014		201							1	500209																							
45	29		301							1	Amberia (Atiel)	AAAHHHHHH!	1																					
46	30		301									Amberia's lower body, already charged, launches a chaotic flurry of attacks. She shoots at random, but is unusually effective at suppressing you and Rosetta.																						
47	1015		201							1	500214	5																						
48	31		301							1	Rosetta	...Ngh.	1																					
49	1016		302								Rosetta, is your M.I.N.D. okay?	32	(Stand in front of Rosetta)	33																				
50	32	1017	301								Rosetta	N-no... Amberia has forcefully linked with my M.I.N.D... The pain... Rgh!	1																					
51	33	34	301									Rosetta is unable to continue fighting in this state, so you pilot your mech in front of Rosetta to protect her from Atiel's attacks.																						
52	34	1017	301								Rosetta	Thank you... Commandant.	1

55	35		301							1	Amberia (Atiel)	AAAAGGHHH!	1																					
56	36		301									The energy pipeline seems to be practically writhing, speeding up energy transfer. Rosetta finally stands, lifting herself up with the back of your mech.

59	37		301							1	Rosetta	Commandant, this doesn't look good. Remember on the files...? Our roots also trace back to Amberia.	1																					
60	38		301								Rosetta	I feel weak all over... Can you try to remote link and dive into my M.I.N.D.?	1																					
61	1021		302								Do you need help calibrating your M.I.N.D.?	39	But if so, we'll both be left open.	40																				
62	39	41	301								Rosetta	No, something more crucial than that...	1																					
63	40	41	301								Rosetta	As I've said, I will keep you safe.	1																					
64	1022		204							1	5																							
65	41		301									With that, Rosetta unfolds her light wings once more. She grips the handle of her spear with her two still functional fingers.																						
66	42		301								Rosetta	Commandant, since Amberia is now linked with my M.I.N.D., you can use it as a proxy to hop into hers—	1																					
67	43		301								Rosetta	Then you can use this... The "code" I just managed to steal.	1																					
68	44		301									Rosetta shows you Evan's voice recorder. She somehow retrieved it in the mayhem just now.																						
69	1023		302								We'll put Amberia back to sleep?	45																						
70	45		301								Rosetta	Yeah... That might sever her link to the bionics... And end the war outside.	1																					
71	46		301				PanelActor1Shake				Rosetta	Commandant... Ngh!	1																					
72	1024		401							2	10007501																							
73	47		301									Amberia launches a sudden barrage at you. Rosetta arduously blocks it with her shield.																						
74	48		301								Rosetta	More importantly... If her M.I.N.D. is weakened, I can stand a chance against her.	1																					
75	49		301									Amberia's energy pellets land on Rosetta's shield and dissipates into an icy sheet of fog. Rosetta turns her head at you in pain.																						
76	1025		204							1	1																							
77	50		301									By the look in her eyes—you could see that she is determined to win.																						
78	1026		302								Win, Rosetta.																							
79	51		301								Rosetta	Please hurry... I don't know how much longer my M.I.N.D. can take it.	1
