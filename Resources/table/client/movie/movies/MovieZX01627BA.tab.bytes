3	3		301			DialogEnable						After walking down the corridor for nearly ten minutes, you finally arrive at a room similar to the entrance of the bomb shelter.

7	7		301									Following Lucia's line of sight, you look around to see a room full of Corrupted.																						
8	8		301									Or rather, what used to be "Corrupted".																						
9	9		301									You can distinguish parts of the Corrupted, while others appear to be deliberately crushed. Among all the carnage, the only recognizable parts belonged to Constructs.																						
10	10		301									The dried up vital fluid and Punishing organisms coagulate together. Even though the foul odor is blocked by your respirator, you still seem to be able to smell the dust and decay.																						
11	11		301									The broken remains remind you of "corpses."																						
12	12		201							1	500166	5																						
13	13		301							1	Lucia	I wasn't expecting to see so many Corrupted remains here...	1																					
14	14		201							1	1031001	14																						
15	15		301							1	Liv	By the looks of their ID codes... A lot of these were Constructs from Babylonia...	1																					
16	16		201							1	500026																							
17	17		301							1	Lee	...Why are they in such a remote place? And... why are there so many of them?	1																					
18	18		202							1					1																			
19	19		301									In any case, such a large amount of remains means...																						
20	20		302								Be careful, everyone.	21	Liv, do you detect any live Corrupted?	22																				
21	21		301									Without awaiting orders, Lucia takes out her katana and takes point in front of the rest of you.																						
22	22		201							1	1031001																							
23	23		301							1	Liv	Scanning for energy responses within 500 meters.	1

25	25		301								Liv	Multiple Corrupted detected. Many appear to be dormant... Ah! Commandant, watch out‚Äî!	1

27	27		401							2	1508																							
28	28		301									Before Liv is able to alert you, something grabs your feet from behind and pulls. A harsh noise like the wind from a broken bellow roars from within the remains.																						
29	29		302								(Open fire)	30	(Think of a way to free yourself)	32																				
30	30		401							2	1510																							
31	31	39	301									Without hesitation, you raise your hand and shoot in the direction of the sound. After a dull thud, the Corrupted on the ground stops moving, and the red light among the remains flickers twice before returning to darkness.																						
32	32		301									Opening fire will likely alert other enemies hiding in the dark. First order of business is to shake off the enemy behind you. Fortunately, the bindings on your legs are weak and take little effort to break free.

38	38		301									Lucia's blade quickly pierces the Corrupted brain with surgical precision. The Corrupted on the ground maintains its grip, but ceases function.																						
39	39		201							1	500026																							
40	40		301							1	Lee	...Dammit.	1																					
41	41		202							1					1																			
42	42		301									As the Corrupted in front falls silent, the surrounding remains gradually light up with red light. You hear the grinding friction of metal from all directions, and find more than a dozen Corrupted climb out of the ruins.																						
43	43		201							1	500026																							
44	44		301							1	Lee	‚ÄîThese aren't just obsolete models, they also come with defense mechanisms. They're older than I thought.	1
