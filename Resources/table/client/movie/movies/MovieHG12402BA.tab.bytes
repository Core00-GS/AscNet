3	3		301			DialogEnable						When you hear something like "hang out at the newly built amusement park," like most people, what comes to mind is a lovely day where everyone has fun.

7	7		201							1	500139																							
8	8		301							1	Staff Member	Alright. Best of luck taking care of these flowers. This task is part of your contract.	1																					
9	9		201							1	500166																							
10	10		301							1	Lucia	I know.	1																					
11	11		302								We're here to work?	12																						
12	12		201							1	500026																							
13	13		301							1	Lee	I thought it was Gray Raven's tradition to work while trying to sneak in some time off.	1																					
14	14		302								Why is it about flowers?	15

17	17		201							2	500166	1	450																					
18	18		301							1	Liv	That's because Gray Raven's rebuilding task has something to do with afforestation. We've been raising plants and flowers and sending them to the city.	1																					
19	19		301								Liv	I know we have machines to help us now, but we still need human minds to make sure everything is going well.	1																					
20	20		301								Lucia	Commandant, Liv told me you weren't feeling so well. Would you like to take a day off?	2																					
21	21		301								Lucia	Playing for free is one of our job benefits. Lee and I will take care of this task. We'll be controlling machines to do the planting for us. It shouldn't be too hard.	2																					
22	22		204							1																								
23	23		301								Liv	I'll give you a hand too.	1																					
24	24		301								Lucia	It's okay, Liv. You should stay and take care of Commandant.	2																					
25	25		302								I'm fine.	26	It's just I'm having trouble recalling things.	26																				
26	26		204							2	5																							
27	27		301								Lucia	Then you're not fine. We've come this far. I'll make sure the four of us live a long, peaceful life.	2																					
28	28		204							1	6																							
29	29		301								Liv	...Well... Lucia, are you sure you are okay on your own?	1																					
30	30		204							2	2																							
31	31		301									With a smile on her face, Lucia points at the gardener robots in the transport vehicle.																						
32	32		301								Lucia	Don't worry. They'll handle it.	2																					
33	33		302								Liv.	34																						
34	34		202							1	2				1																			
35	35		301									If you do not ask Liv to come and help out, she will probably be overwhelmed by guilt.																						
36	36		302								Let's go.	37																						
37	37		201							1	1031001																							
38	38		301							1	Liv	...Hmm...	1																					
39	39		301									Liv answers your call and comes to you, but she still looks worried.																						
40	40		302								We'll take a look around and come back to take over your shift.	41																						
41	41		201							1	500026																							
42	42		301							1	Lee	It's just a small task. You should try to relax. There's no need to worry about us.	1																					
43	43		301								Lee	After all, life is short. You gotta cherish every second of it.	1																					
44	44		302								...	45																						
45	45		301								Lee	What? You said it yourself.	1																					
46	46		302								Did I?	47																						
47	47		204							1	6																							
48	48		301								Lee	...	1																					
49	49		201							1	500166	2																						
50	50		301							1	Lucia	Anyway, you should go and have fun.	1																					
51	51		302								Alright.	52	Off to the amusement park that's filled with peace and love!	52

55	55		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The two of you say goodboye to Lucia and Lee and walk into the crowd, side by side.																						
56	56		301									It has only been five years since the Punishing Virus disaster ended, but it is clear there are now a lot more newborn human babies and animals.																						
57	57		301									The sunlight at noon is warm. You take a deep breath. The wind carries with it a pleasant smell of grass and dirt.																						
58	58		201							1	1031001	1																						
59	59		301							1	Liv	...	1																					
60	60		301									Liv doesn't utter a word. But the look on her face says it all.																						
61	61		302								Do you like amusement parks?	62																						
62	62		301								Liv	I do, especially in a time of peace like this. Everyone looks happy.	1																					
63	63		301								Liv	So, I'm happy too...	1																					
64	64		301									This young lady is like a flower, nourished by other people's happiness and thriving in a season that best suits her.																						
65	65		301								Liv	There is still much to do before we can rebuild this place, but we don't have to worry about losing our friends anymore.	1																					
66	66		204							1	19																							
67	67		301							1	Liv	...It's just that you don't seem very well, Commandant.	1																					
68	68		302								I'm fine.	69																						
69	69		302								But...	70																						
70	70		302								Now that peace has been restored...	71																						
71	71		302								You don't have to call me Commandant anymore.	72

81	81		301								Liv	Where... Where are we going now?	1																					
82	82		302								Where would you like to go?	83																						
83	83		301								Liv	I... I don't know.	1																					
84	84		302								You've never been to an amusement park before?	85																						
85	85		204							1																								
86	86		301								Liv	Well, my mother didn't feel well ever since she gave birth to me.	1																					
87	87		301								Liv	And then, she passed away... so I never had a chance to visit an amusement park.	1																					
88	88		302								(Patting her head)	89	It's okay. From now on, I can take you here whenever we have time to spare.	92																				
89	89		204							1	6																							
90	90		301								Liv	...C-Commandant...! Oh, I mean... „Äêkuroname„Äë...	1																					
91	91		302								I'll take you here whenever we have time to spare.	92																						
92	92		301								Liv	Wouldn't that be a burden for you?	1																					
93	93		302								It won't.	94																						
94	94		302								Liv, you like it when other people are happy.	95																						
95	95		302								And I like it when you are happy.	96																						
96	96		204							1	1																							
97	97		301								Liv	Well... Thank you.	1																					
98	98		301									She happily nods and gets closer to you.																						
99	99		301								Liv	Well... Shall we go check out what's the most popular thing here?	1																					
100	100		301									She points at the roller coaster with a sign that says "Galaxy Ship." You can hear the sound of people laughing and screaming from that facility.

You two only have to wait in queue for a few minutes before it is your turn to board the "Galaxy Ship."																						
106	106		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory100.png

116	117		301								Liv	The wind is cozy. Now that's something you don't get to experience in the universe.	1																					
117	118		301									The girl is calm on this roller coaster ride, unlike those who are screaming out loud.																						
118	119		302								Aren't you scared?	120	Haven't we seen enough space for a lifetime?	120																				
119	120		301								Liv	Well, we were driving transport crafts all the time whenever we were in an operation. This is nothing new.	1																					
120	121		302								Do you miss the old days?	122																						
121	122		204							1	1																							
122	123		301								Liv	I don't, because all my friends are here with me.	1

126	127		204							1	6																							
127	128		301									You put your hand on Liv's soft hand and notice that her hand trembles a bit.

129	130	132	301								Liv	...Hmm...	1																					
130	131		301								Liv	All my dreams have come true.	1

132	133		301									The bond you share allows you to read each other's minds without uttering a word.

137	138		301									She looks around and focuses her attention on a toy store nearby.																						
138	139		302								Would you like to buy a souvenir?	140																						
139	140		201							1	1031001	1																						
140	141		301							1	Liv	...It's okay. A souvenir is not a necessity.	1																					
141	142		302								Let's go check it out.	143																						
142	143		301								Liv	...Well, okay.	1																					
143	144		202							1					1																			
144	145		301									You go to the store and realize they are not just selling toys but holding a shooter game for participants to win toys as prizes.																						
145	146		201							1	500140																							
146	147		301							1	Tourist	Sir, are you sure this gun can hit the balloon?	1																					
147	148		301								Toy Store Shopkeeper	Of course it can. Would you like me to show it? Just because you can't hit the target doesn't mean the gun is not working!																						
148	149		301								Tourist	Tch!																						
149	150		201							1	500420

154	155		301							1	Liv	...Are you sure that is a good idea?	1																					
155	156		301									Having noticed the shopkeeper is looking at you, she lowers her voice.																						
156	157		302								Which one of us are you worried about?	158																						
157	158		301									Seeing how she has lowered her voice, you too start whispering to her.																						
158	159		301								Liv	...Well.	1																					
159	160		202							1					1																			
160	161		301								Toy Store Shopkeeper	Would you like to give it a try?																						
161	162		301									While she is still hesitating, the shopkeeper has sent away the other tourists and turned to the two of you.																						
162	163		301								Toy Store Shopkeeper	20 Black Cards to play a round. You have 20 bullets. If you land 17 shots, you get a small toy. 18 shots for a medium one. 19 shots for a large one. And if you land all the shots, you can have any toy, plus an extra round for free.																						
163	164		302								Liv, how about you give it a try?	165																						
164	165		201							1	1031001	3																						
165	166		301							1	Liv	Huh? But I'm not really a sharpshooter...	1

167	168		401							1	36																							
168	169		301								Toy Store Shopkeeper	Hold on a second. No Constructs are allowed to play this game. Otherwise, I'd be broke.																						
169	170		301									The shopkeeper points at the sign in his shop. It says, "Warning: choking hazard. Small parts. Not for children under 3 years." followed by "Only humans are allowed to play."																						
170	171		302								I gave you a chance.	172	I'll give it a try, then.	177																				
171	172		401							1	205																							
172	173		301								Toy Store Shopkeeper	?																						
173	174		301								Toy Store Shopkeeper	Even the Chief Commandant of Babylonia only managed to land 18 shots.																						
174	175		302								Huh? Which Chief was it?	176																						
175	176		301								Toy Store Shopkeeper	How am I supposed to remember that? It was a long time ago.																						
176	177		401							1	205																							
177	178		301								Toy Store Shopkeeper	Pay before you play.																						
178	179		302								Alright.	180

180	181		301							1	Liv	...	1																					
181	182		202							1					1																			
182	183		301									You pay the fee, take up the toy gun, and do a quick check to have a rough idea of how the toy bullets work and how the environment will affect your accuracy.																						
183	184		301								Toy Store Shopkeeper	You look like a pro. Were you a soldier before?																						
184	185		302								Yeah.	186																						
185	186		301									You observe the balloons that are moving up and down. It seems their speed changes slightly every five to eight seconds.																						
186	187		302								I see what it is.	188																						
187	188		301									So that's why the shopkeeper knows his players won't win this game.																						
188	189		301									You adjust the timing and aim at the balloons before firing.																						
189	190		401						500	2	1510

209	210		302								May I do the second round now?	211																						
210	211		301								Toy Store Shopkeeper	Uh, yeah, sure. I'm a man of my word.																						
211	212		301									Trying to stay calm, the shopkeeper hands you another gun.																						
212	213		302								(Take the new toy gun)	214																						
213	214		202							1					1																			
214	215		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					It is lighter and in a much poorer condition.

217	218		401							2	1510																							
218	219		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						But after some careful observation and adjusting, you once again land 20 shots.

231	232		302								(I knew it. She's picking toys for the others again.)	233																						
232	233		302								I'll do another round, please.	234																						
233	234		301									The shopkeeper doesn't say a word. Distressed, he nods at you and leans on the wall, his eyes still fixated on you.																						
234	235		302								You are not going to give me a new gun this time?	236																						
235	236		301								Toy Store Shopkeeper	No.																						
236	237		202							1					1																			
237	238		301									To your surprise, when you try to aim this time, it seems the balloons are moving at a higher speed.																						
238	239		302								...	240	I can handle that.	240																				
239	240		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You hold your breath, focus on the track of the balloons, and adjust your aim.

246	247		301								Toy Store Shopkeeper	In that case, how about we take a picture together to remember this special moment?																						
247	248		301									Before you can answer, the shopkeeper has raised his terminal and aims it at you.																						
248	249		301								Toy Store Shopkeeper	Say cheese!

259	260		301									Having noticed that her eyes are on the shelf where the frog plushies are, you lower your voice to remind her.																						
260	261		302								If I keep doing another round, the shopkeeper is going to cry.	262	Do you want me to continue until we have all the frog plushies?	262

262	263		301							1	Liv	I... No... Okay, fine. I get your point...	1

264	265		301									This girl always puts other people's needs before her own. The only way to stop her from doing that is to use a victim to make her feel guilty.																						
265	266		301									Liv walks into the store, her hands holding together, and picks her favorite sheep plushie this time.																						
266	267		302								Let me take that for you.	268

268	269		301							1	Liv	Sure...	1																					
269	270		301									Smiling, you put the toy gun on the arcade table and take the large frog plushie and the small robot from Liv's arms. Then you wave goodbye to the shopkeeper.																						
270	271		301								Toy Store Shopkeeper	Thanks for stopping by. Don't you ever come back again. You are on my blacklist now.																						
271	272		302								You are most welcome.	273

273	274		301									Holding large plushies in your arms, the two of you go through the crowd and realize that, while you were focusing on the game, you had helped the shopkeeper draw quite a lot of attention.

275	276		301							1	Tourist 1	This looks easy. I want to give it a try as well, sir.	1																					
276	277		301								Toy Store Shopkeeper	That will be 20 Black Cards. Pay before you play.

280	281		302								That's nice.	282																						
281	282		301									You turn your attention from the crowd to Liv. She is burying her head in the furry, cuddly sheep plushie in her arms.																						
282	283		301									Having noticed you are looking at her, she moves her head away from the plushie toy and pretends as if nothing happened.																						
283	284		302								Hah.	285

288	289		301								Liv	Because...	1																					
289	290		301									Feeling nervous, she tightens her grip on the plushie's fur.																						
290	291		301								Liv	If you hadn't put it that way... I might not get this toy.	1																					
291	292		301								Liv	But I feel... so happy that I can hold it in my arms. We earned it together.	1																					
292	293		301								Liv	So... thank you.	1																					
293	294		302								You're welcome.	295

295	296		301								Liv	We should head back. I gotta get these "loots" to Lucia and Lee.	1
