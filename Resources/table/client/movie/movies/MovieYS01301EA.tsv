21	21		301							1	Lee	We're lucky it was not the Ascendant... But she might be more of a trouble than the Ascendants. Why is she here anyway?	1																					
22	22		201							1	1041001																							
23	23		301							1	Nanami	It's such an interesting mission. How could you leave me out of it? That was unacceptable, Commandant.	1																					
24	24		302								Eh? Is it my fault?	25	I didn't think it through.	25																				
25	25		201							1	1011001	10

28	28		301							1	Liv	Commandant, according to the record analysis of the system monitor station, a data fluctuation with a deviation value of 0.0274 was captured not long after the mission was released. But since it was fixed soon...	1																					
29	29		301								Liv	There was no record of any information theft warnings or error reports in the system...	1

70	70		201							1	500071																							
71	71		301							1	Becky	You're individuals certified with Marshal Cottie's SEC2355 data inquiry. Thus, you're allowed to inquire about information with a confidentiality level below A.	1

73	73		301							1	Lucia	The analysis of the memory coordinate information has been uploaded to the tactical terminal.	1																					
74	74		301								Lucia	Are the storage coordinates of the original memory data of Moe Army that we acquired correct? And are there any changes or abnormalities in the state of memory?	1																					
75	75		201							1	500071																							
76	76		301							1	Becky	The error rate of coordinate information is 2.12%, basically consistent with the data.	1																					
77	77		301								Becky	Unable to determine the status information.	1																					
78	78		201							1	1021001																							
79	79		301							1	Lucia	And why is that?	1																					
80	80		201							1	500071																							
81	81		301							1	Becky	The networking module is damaged, so the current information cannot be obtained. I'm having trouble determining the status of other memories.	1																					
82	82		201							1	1021001																							
83	83		301							1	Lucia	I see. Thanks for your help.	1

87	87		302								Lucia is also like that.	88	Perhaps it's not like that.	88

95	95		301								Lucia	What? Excuse me, Commandant, I wasn't paying attention.	1																					
96	96		301								Lucia	Testing and recycling completed. Now let's head back to the base, shall we?	1
