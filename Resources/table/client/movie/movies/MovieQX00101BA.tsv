10	9		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						A few days had passed since you returned from the Venus Splash Park. Though your wounds had not fully healed, at least HQ had conveniently forgotten about your existence.

12	11		301							1	Liv	Judging from the test just now, you'll fully recover in a week.	1																					
13	12		302								Good.	13																						
14	13		301								Liv	By the way...	1																					
15	14		301									Liv handed over a fragrant, delicate cardboard box.																						
16	15		301								Liv	It's a gift from Celica. She said she'd come to visit you after finishing another hundred million tasks.	1																					
17	16		301									Picturing Celica with a cake box in one hand and a stack of papers in another on unsteady steps, you could not help but give a wry smile.																						
18	17		302								I see. Please thank her for me.	18	I'll thank her once I've recovered.	18																				
19	18		301								Liv	Of course.	1																					
20	19		301								Liv	But... sugar and carbs are no good for recovery...	1																					
21	20		301								Liv	Right now, it's still important to save your appetite for more proteins so that you'll recover sooner.	1																					
22	21		302								Alright.	22																						
23	22		301									Soon as you set the cake box aside, your communication device rang.																						
24	23		301								Liv	I'll get going then. I still have some work to do.	1																					
25	24		301									You nodded to Liv, and when you looked back at the screen, you found a surprising figure.

29	28		302								Pretty good.	29																						
30	29		301								Changyu	I heard you were beaten up in that Venus Splash Park. But now you're "pretty good"? Impressive.	1																					
31	30		201							1	500145	1																						
32	31		301							1	Pulao	【kuroname】, how about coming to the Nighter for vacation? It's almost the Double Seventh Festival.	1																					
33	32		302								Why are you two together?	33																						
34	33		201							1	500124	1																						
35	34		301							1	Changyu	Oh, curious?	1

37	36		301							1	Sophia	We've made a pact with the Nighter. So we're staying together for now.	1																					
38	37		301								Sophia	It's the first time we've worked together on a festival, so we'd like you to come and experience it.	1																					
39	38		302								I still haven't gotten over that last "vacation."	39																						
40	39		201							1	500145	1																						
41	40		301							1	Pulao	Relax, it's definitely a vacation this time.	1																					
42	41		201							1	500127																							
43	42		301							1	Sophia	That's right. It's a business partnership between Akdilek and the Nighter.	1																					
44	43		201							1	500145	1																						
45	44		301							1	Pulao	We've been very busy since losing our leader. So they've taken over the Nighter for the time being.	1																					
46	45		302								By the way, what is the Double Seventh Festival?	46																						
47	46		201							1	500124	1																						
48	47		301							1	Changyu	In short, it's a traditional festival where people gather to enjoy all kinds of entertainment, while folks like us do some business and sell some stuff...	1																					
49	48		201							1	500127																							
50	49		301							1	Sophia	Here is some information.	1																					
51	50		301									Sophia gave you a brief overview of the planned events on the Nighter.																						
52	51		201							1	500124	1																						
53	52		301							1	Changyu	How does that sound? Just think about it.	1																					
54	53		302								Why me?	3330																						
55	3330		201							1	500145	1																						
56	54		301							1	Pulao	You've been good to us. Think of it as our token of appreciation.	1																					
57	55		302								I need to discuss it with the others.	57	Nah, I'll pass.	58																				
58	57	60	301								Pulao	Alright then. I look forward to hearing from you. Be sure to come!	1

67	66		302								(Briefly explain)	67																						
68	67		301								Hassen	Oh, so the ACA took over the Nighter for now?	1																					
69	68		301									Hassen thought for a moment.																						
70	69		301								Hassen	Why not have a gander?	1																					
71	70		301								Hassen	Keeping in touch with them won't do Babylonia any harm, at least for now.	1																					
72	71		302								I request an overtime payment.	72	Sure.	73																				
73	72		301								Hassen	Don't be so defensive. Are you worried that it's another one of those... overtime vacations?	1																					
74	73		301								Hassen	It's an easy task—just write up a report about what's been going on in Kowloong when you get back. How does that sound?	1																					
75	74		302								...	75	Fine.	75																				
76	75		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Hassen	Bon voyage.	1

88	85		201							2	1031001	1	400																					
89	86		301								Liv	May I ask... What do we do on vacation in Kowloong?	2																					
90	87		201							2	500145		400																					
91	88		301								Pulao	Feel free to check the sightseeing guide for details—oh, wait, it doesn't seem to be ready yet...	2																					
92	89		201							2	500026		400																					
93	90		301							1	Lee	You wanted to expand your business and tourism, and your guide is not even ready?	2																					
94	91		301								Changyu	Look, it hasn't been long since we started working together. And there are so many things waiting to be done!	1																					
95	92		201							2	500127		400																					
96	93		301							1	Sophia	If I'm not mistaken, we're all supposed to submit a design. You're the only one who hasn't handed it in yet, Changyu.	2																					
97	94		301								Changyu	Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.	1																					
98	95		201							2	500145	1	400																					
99	96		301							1	Pulao	Never mind, I'll be the tour guide for you this time. It's an exclusive service I provide for Gray Raven!	2																					
100	97		301								Changyu	Wonderful. Pulao will show you around the night market on the deck.	1																					
101	98		301								Changyu	There are a lot of festival crafts over there exquisitely made with care. 【kuroname】, how about bringing some souvenirs back with you?	1																					
102	99		302								Hold your horses, Mr. Salesman.	100																						
103	100		301								Pulao	That's fine! You don't have to buy anything.	2																					
104	101		301								Changyu	You're not going to be an adequate merchant if that's your sales pitch!	1																					
105	5004		204							2																								
106	102		301								Pulao	Those crafts are made for the Double Seventh Festival. As our first event on the Nighter, it's more important to recreate and pass on the history recorded by Kowloong!	2																					
107	103		301								Pulao	Akdilek might have an established business model, but Kowloong does things our way. We don't do hard sells.	2																					
108	108		301								Changyu	Fine, fine...	1																					
109	109		301								Changyu	Right, 【kuroname】, you can't buy things without grubs. Would you like to exchange some with me?	1																					
110	110		302								Alright.	111	No thanks.	112																				
111	111	5005	301								Changyu	Good. Remember to enjoy your stroll around the night market and help promote it when you return. We can always use more guests here!	1																					
112	112		301								Changyu	Come on, don't say no to me! I'll give you a 10% off in exchange, how about that?	1																					
113	113		301								Pulao	【kuroname】 is a guest of mine, so I should offer you this!	2																					
114	114		301									Pulao hands you a bag of grubs without any explanation.																						
115	115		301								Changyu	Fine. Remember to enjoy your stroll around the night market and help promote it when you return. We can always use more guests here!	1																					
116	5005		204							2	1																							
117	116		301								Pulao	Let's get going. I'll show you what the Double Seventh Festival is like in Kowloong!	2																					
118	117		201							1	500166		-400																					
119	118		301							1	Lucia	The Double Seventh Festival?	1																					
120	119		301								Pulao	Exactly. It's said to be a festival that celebrates a love story.	2																					
121	120		301								Lucia	What kind of love story... would have people create a festival for it?	1																					
122	121		301								Pulao	There are a lot of versions of it. Mostly it's about a fairy from the heavens who fell in love with a mortal.	2																					
123	122		201							1	1031001	6	-400																					
124	123		301							1	Liv	...Fairy?	1																					
125	124		301								Pulao	Yeah, according to the myths, all fairies come from the skies.	2																					
126	3100		204							1	1																							
127	125		301								Liv	By the skies, do you mean Babylonia?	1																					
128	126		301								Pulao	Uhm... I guess? Maybe?	2																					
129	127		201							1	500166		-400																					
130	128		301							1	Lucia	What happened next? Did they end up together?	1																					
131	129		301								Pulao	No. Because of their different status, they were separated by their king and sent to the two ends of the starry sea, never able to see each other again.	2																					
132	130		301								Lucia	Just because of that?	1																					
133	131		301								Pulao	They say there are other reasons in different versions of the story, but there aren't that many records left on the Nighter, so that's all I can tell you.	2																					
134	132		301								Pulao	However, the story does not end here. After they were separated, the cries of the two moved the king. So they were allowed to meet once every year on July 7th on a "magpie bridge" built by magpies.	2																					
135	133		201							1	1031001	6	-400																					
136	134		301							1	Liv	Can magpies really build bridges?	1																					
137	135		301								Pulao	Of course they can—in stories! Legend has it that they'd work so hard they go bald while building it.	2																					
138	136		301								Liv	I hope they didn't get hurt...	1																					
139	137		201							1	500026	10	-400																					
140	138		301							1	Lee	These are just fantasies humans made up while looking up at the sky in ancient times. How could magpies build bridges?	1																					
141	139		301								Pulao	That's just what I know from the files on the ship! I'll tell you how magpies build bridges when I find more records in Kowloong.	2																					
142	141		204							1		4																						
143	140		301								Lee	So you're holding an event in the name of this festival when you don't fully know its origin and meaning?	1																					
144	142		301								Pulao	In the records of the Golden Age, the Double Seventh Festival was quite popular among people in Kowloong. There were a lot of related commercial and entertainment events.	2																					
145	143		301								Pulao	I thought it would be nice for this place to feel lively again. It's a festival, after all.	2																					
146	144		301								Pulao	Anyway, you'll know what it's all about after I show you around!	2																					
147	145		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Pulao	Just come with me!	2
