9	9		301								Rosetta	Waking up to find myself in a cell... What are you people up to?	1																					
10	10		201							1	500012																							
11	11		301							1	Nikola	I want you to join us in this battle, Rosetta.	1																					
12	12		201							1	500098	8																						
13	13		301							1	Rosetta	You're keeping me in the dark for how I got here, huh...	1																					
14	14		201							1	500012																							
15	15		301							1	Nikola	We told the Forest Guard that you have a better chance of recovery here, and look. That's exactly how it turned out. If you stayed in that dump, you'd probably still be in a coma.	1																					
16	16		201							1	500098	4																						
17	17		301							1	Rosetta	Coma... So what happened... after Alpha?	1																					
18	18		201							1	500012																							
19	19		301							1	Nikola	You can check the reports later. I have no obligation to explain this to you. So will you join the battle, Rosetta?	1																					
20	20		201							1	500098																							
21	21		301							1	Rosetta	Where, and against whom?	1																					
22	22		201							1	500012																							
23	23		301							1	Nikola	Kowloong Corp. The Ascendants are the enemy. Also, the Forest Guards are heading there too.	1																					
24	24		201							1	500098	14																						
25	25		301							1	Rosetta	Diana and the others? Why...	1																					
26	26		201							1	500012																							
27	27		301							1	Nikola	I can't give you a satisfactory answer. I come here, only for your strength.	1																					
28	28		301								Nikola	Although you're not as good as the Ascendants, you can still hold them in place for us. Use yourself for Babylonia.	1																					
29	29		301								Nikola	This is why I had you, a "sinner," given special treatment in Babylonia.	1																					
30	30		201							1	500098	8																						
31	31		301							1	Rosetta	...My weapons.	1																					
32	32		201							1	500012																							
33	33		301							1	Nikola	Centaur-type modules are not Babylonia tech, so we can only give you temporarily manufactured spears. Take on as many enemies as you can. Nod if you understand.	1																					
34	34		202							1																								
35	35		301									And so Rosetta nods.																						
36	36		201							1	500012

38	38		202							1																								
39	39		301			RImgBg1Shake						The guard follows Nikola's command and opens the cell wall. The instant Rosetta is free, she grabs Nikola by the throat with one hand, too fast for the guards to react.

41	41		301							1	Guard	You!	1																					
42	42		201							1	500098	5																						
43	43		301							1	Rosetta	You are Nikola, correct? Get this right in your head. I am not fighting for Babylonia.	1																					
44	44		301								Rosetta	I'm fighting for those who've helped me.	1

52	52		301								Rosetta	...It's me, Diana.	1																					
53	53		202							1	2																							
54	54		301									A familiar figure blocks Alpha's blade‚ÄîRosetta. As if in replay of their first meeting, Rosetta is clutching her javelin and shield, glaring at the upright Alpha.																						
55	55		201							1	500100																							
56	56		301							1	Œ±	To actually go so far... What did Babylonia do to you? Memory tampering, or are you a copy?	1																					
57	57		201							1	500098	5																						
58	58		301							1	Rosetta	I am me myself, Alpha.	1																					
59	59		202							1																								
60	60		301									Seeing the two, Diana is suddenly reminded of the past. The regret of not being there for Rosetta lingers deep in the recesses of her mind. So instead of doing as Rosetta said in the Arctic, she shuffles closer to her.																						
61	61		301									The other Forest Guards seem to have the same thoughts. To them, the collective is always the highest priority.																						
62	62		201							1	500098	5																						
63	63		301							1	Rosetta	Don't!	1

65	65		301							1	Diana	...Why?	1																					
66	66		202							1																								
67	67		301									At Rosetta's shout, Diana notices the golden particles floating around her, unknown, unforeseen, but no less frightening.

77	75		201							1	500100																							
78	76		301							1	Œ±	I would have. But that'd be putting me on the bench. You lot sure know how to ruin someone's day.	1
