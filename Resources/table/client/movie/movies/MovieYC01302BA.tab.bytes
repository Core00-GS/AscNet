5	5		301			DialogEnable				1	Roland	Miss Luna, we have fully investigated Venus Splash Park.	1																					
6	6		301								Roland	According to that scar-faced man, that place should be Shome's final destination. But...	1																					
7	7		201							1	500105																							
8	8		301							1	Luna	Worry not. He has no reason to lie about this. A non-fatal betrayal is pointless.	1																					
9	9		201							1	500008																							
10	10		301							1	Roland	Very well. Then we shall begin making preparations.	1

13	13		201							1	500105	13																						
14	14		301							1	Luna	Before you begin, there is someone that requires our attention.	1

17	17		301									Luna lightly tapped the screen next to her seat several times. A connection was made.																						
18	18		301								Vigorous Male Voice	Thank you for waiting, my fellow colleagues.																						
19	19		301								Vigorous Male Voice	These are the coordinates of Shome's current facility. Happy hunting to you all.																						
20	20		301									With the transmission of the middle-aged man's voice, the terminal screen flickered‚Äîa huge red mark pointing to the middle of a desert in North America.																						
21	21		301									With the coordinates confirmed, Luna cut off the connection.																						
22	22		201							1	500008	4																						
23	23		301							1	Roland	What is it that you wish for, Miss Luna?	1																					
24	24		201							1	500105	13																						
25	25		301							1	Luna	We want Shome dead, by hook or by crook. But we have to destroy all of his trump cards and research materials before he dies.	1																					
26	26		301								Luna	Covet that which shan't be coveted, and be prepared to go through fire and water.	1																					
27	27		301									Listening eagerly, Roland raised his chain blade. He looked excitedly at the seated Luna.																						
28	28		301								Luna	Which is why, I need you and Gabriel to drive this rat out of his hole.	1																					
29	29		201							1	500008	4																						
30	30		301							1	Roland	Huh?	1																					
31	31		201							1	500105																							
32	32		301							1	Luna	To allow him a soundless death is mercy. He will attend his own funeral at the place and time of our choosing.	1																					
33	33		301								Luna	And when that time comes, you will have plenty of time to play your game.	1																					
34	34		301								Luna	Of course. That must wait until after we achieve our goals. Do you understand?	1																					
35	35		202							1																								
36	36		301									Luna speaks lightly, but the Ascendants present can instantly feel the oppression in her words. Anyone who hears cannot help but obey.

42	42		301							1	Luna	Good. After you two confirm that Shome has departed, Alpha will make sure no one comes to intercept Shome on his way to the stage.	1																					
43	43		301								Luna	Until then, set up the hunting grounds, and wait quietly.	1																					
44	44		301								Luna	Lamia.	1																					
45	45		202							1																								
46	46		301									Luna's words echoed in the empty Ascendant base. A few seconds later, the scenery behind Roland and Gabriel distorted.																						
47	47		201							1	500165																							
48	48		301							1	Lamia	...I-I'm here.	1																					
49	49		201							1	500105																							
50	50		301							1	Luna	Very well. We shall split up and meet at Venus Splash Park.	1

60	59		301								Roland	Phew, guess we're finally here.	1																					
61	60		301									Gabriel's words remove Roland from his reminiscence. Roland returns his gaze from the sea and to the so-called speedboat he is on.																						
62	61		204							1																								
63	62		301								Roland	I never thought you had a penchant for modding. This thing runs fast. Though, the shape is quite... questionable.	1																					
64	63		301								Gabriel	Function over form. This thing can even be used as a mobile arsenal.	2																					
65	64		301								Gabriel	Press this button, and it will run on the current route and detonate when it hits the target.	2																					
66	65		301								Roland	Okay, that's more than I need to know. I have no plans of going on an explosive lover's leap with you.	1																					
67	66		301								Gabriel	The phrase lover's leap is inaccurate. According to the books...	2																					
68	67		301								Roland	Oh, yes, yes. You are just dull as dishwater, my man.	1																					
69	68		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	Enough bantering. Let's go ashore. We still have to set the stage.	1
