15	12		301								Lucia	Liv, did the radar pick anything up?	1																					
16	233		204							2	14																							
17	13		301								Liv	Cannot determine exact coordinates. Someone is interfering with Commandant's signals...	2

19	14		301								Liv	Lee is trying to locate and neutralize the source of the interference, but they're very good at hiding...	2

22	16		301							1	Lee	The signal is perfectly disguised. Whoever is doing it must be very familiar with how our radar positioning systems work.	2																					
23	236		204							2																								
24	401		201							2	1021001					1																		
25	17		301								Lucia	Let's note that down first. Right now, our priority is to locate Commandant. Lee, how long do you need to decode the signal?	2																					
26	402		201							2	500026					1																		
27	18		301								Lee	Ten minutes, or less.	2

37	25		301								Aston	Amir has important matters to tend to.	1																					
38	26		301								Aston	The mechanic patrols told us what happened. It is Akdilek's fault for not taking better care of its guest aboard Asslam.	1																					
39	27		301								Aston	We will do all we can to help find your commandant.	1																					
40	28		301								Aston	By the way, may I inquire as to the whereabouts of Miss Bianca? Could it be possible that she and your commandant left on some urgent business?	1

42	30		201							2	500127		400			1																		
43	31		301							1	Lucia	Commandant would never leave us without notice. As for Bianca, she returned to Babylonia yesterday for another mission.	1																					
44	32		301								Lucia	So Bianca's departure does not coincide with the time Commandant went missing.	1

62	50		201							1	500124					1																		
63	51		301							1	Changyu	Akdilek stores all kinds of spices for trade. You foreigners can't tell the smell apart, but I can... and I'm all too familiar with this scent.	1																					
64	52		301								Changyu	...It's the smell of a knockout drug.	1																					
65	53		201							1	500026					1

74	60		301							1	Changyu	I'm afraid your Commandant got "bought", much like how I got sold to this place.	1

81	66		301								Lee	I tried to pull up info about the city from the database, but I don't have the clearance. Only the names "Citong Port" and "Kowloong Chamber of Commerce" showed up.	2
