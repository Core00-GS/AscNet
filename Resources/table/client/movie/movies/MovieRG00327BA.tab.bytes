14	14		301								Liv	It's a dead end...	2																					
15	15		301									One could not run forever. Neither the Demon King nor Liv had any idea where to go.																						
16	16		301									They fell into a trap left by Vera in panic and were surrounded after more guards arrived.																						
17	17		301								Liv	Are you after the Demon King?	2

27	27		201							1	500181																							
28	28		301							1	Vera	It's the name given to those who can repair the artifact. It seems to be a special class generated by the system based on the player's skill.	1

33	33		301								Demon King	Yes. But I have never tried it myself, so...	1

36	36		301							1	Vera	Whoever gets the artifact gets the power of the Goddess. That seems to be how this game is configured. Whether it's the King or the Demon King doesn't matter.	1																					
37	37		301								Vera	Everybody has their eyes on this power.	1																					
38	38		301								Vera	Anyway, if we get you, we get half of the artifact. Your Commandant will bring the other half to us.	1

45	45		201							1	500181																							
46	46		301							1	Vera	Yeah, we have three, but it's only a matter of time before we get the last piece. You stand no chance, Demon King.	1																					
47	47		301									Vera waved her hand, sending all the guards forward.
