8	8		302								O-of course!	9	Not the biggest big shot, but still...	9																				
9	9		301									With your pride on the line, you have at least managed to finish your lantern before the three children completely lose their patience.

12	12		301								Deckard	Mission accomplished! Our supplier did come in quite handy—how about we take you around the camp and play?	3																					
13	13		301								Ann	We can't! We promised Uncle Watanabe not to wander off!	1

25	25		301									You can tell Zong is clearly hiding something from the children, which makes it difficult for you to inquire further as well... But you are certain this is not a prank.

51	51		301									Zong peeks at the entrance—and finds a medium-sized group of Corrupted waltzing through the gate before being divided and diverted by the intermingled paths, slowly advancing.																						
52	52		301								Zong	They're here, just like we planned... I mean, just like you planned! I'll leave the next part to you!	1																					
53	53		301								Watanabe	Go find a safe place to hide... and don't die.	2																					
54	54		301								Zong	One more thing... Since I've worked so hard on this, can we talk about the previous punishment where I cannot eat—	1

61	62		301							1	Guard Leader	Sir, check that out...	1																					
62	63		301									Outside the gates are speckles of lights—lanterns made with simple colored paper and plastic films, and yet they shine brightly nonetheless.

70	71		301									The CUB that has been staying by Watanabe's side runs ahead of the squad and gestures toward a direction.																						
71	72		301									As Watanabe acknowledges it, celebratory fireworks—as tradition dictates—explode above the Forsaken campsite in the distance behind the hills. The explosions offer the perfect cover for the coming fight.
