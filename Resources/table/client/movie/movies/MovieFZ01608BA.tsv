4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Bridget	Hey, you guys arrive at the right time.	1																					
5	5		301								Bridget	I'm caught up in all these rescue missions here and I'm in over my head. Would you be able to help?	1																					
6	6		302								No thanks...	7	Sure.	8																				
7	7	2301	301								Bridget	Come on. It's got to do with the Red Tide, and we can't really ask the newbies for help. I'm sure Gray Raven is a lot more experienced.	1																					
8	8		301								Bridget	I knew I could count on the Gray Ravens.	1

10	9		301								Bridget	So here's the deal: the Silk Worm Commandant and a Construct member have been engulfed by the rising tide. We've lost all contact with them.	1																					
11	10		301								Bridget	I think it might be too late to do anything now...	1																					
12	11		301								Bridget	One of the two remaining Constructs in their team has been assigned to a different group.	1																					
13	12		301								Bridget	Things are a little more complicated with the other one. She wasn't there with them when their commandant was attacked, because she had been under treatment for severe injury.	1																					
14	13		301								Bridget	She regretted not being able to save their commandant, and firmly believes that he is just too injured to contact us and that he's waiting to be rescued.	1																					
15	14		301								Bridget	So she refused to be assigned to a different team and later escaped at night. She's also somehow blocked location tracking.	1																					
16	15		301								Bridget	I would have asked a technician to track her down any other day, but we really need to do it ourselves now.	1																					
17	16		301								Bridget	So? Would you be able to help?	1																					
18	17		302								...Very well.	2302																						
19	2302		204							1	1																							
20	18		301								Bridget	Wonderful! Well, let me send her information to your terminal.	1																					
21	19		301								Bridget	She's probably looking for their commandant where the Red Tide has been. Look for her in the ruins.	1

23	21		301							1	Lucia	Ruolin, frame name Antler, Attacker Construct.	1

25	23		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Bridget	Yes, that's her. I'll leave the job to you.	1
