16	16		301									How long has it been since she made that promise?																						
17	17		301									Now, they are trapped inside this church, a sanctum that should be protected by the gods, and all they can hear is the sound of the Hetero-Creatures surrounding them.																						
18	18		301									She knows her companions are nearby, but she cannot move an inch from all the Corrupted and Hetero-Creatures blocking her way.																						
19	19		301									She tries to call for her companion, but the transmissions only return disjointed words and white noise.																						
20	20		301									Perhaps it is true that sometimes prayers do not get answered in this world.

24	24		301									In a brief moment of trance, Lucia recalls the place that sent her down the path of becoming a Construct.

29	29		301							1	Lucia	That... was also a church...	1																					
30	30		301									She lost her last family at a church. Is she going to fall at a place like it as well?																						
31	31		301								Lucia	This... isn't the end...	1																					
32	32		301									Supporting herself with her katana, Lucia struggles as she moves forward.																						
33	33		301								Lucia	We haven't...	1																					
34	34		301									Her will is still defiant, but her frame can no longer support the fight that has lasted over ten days.																						
35	35		301									It is time to face the truthâ€”perhaps this is the end of the line.																						
36	36		301								Lucia	...	1																					
37	37		301									Did they make the wrong choice?																						
38	38		301									Should they have followed Liv back no matter what?																						
39	39		301								Lucia	No...	1																					
40	40		301									More people would have been lost if they had not stayed.																						
41	41		301									That is not something she, or anyone from Gray Raven, would want to see.																						
42	42		301									Captain Chrome has not complained about the harsh battles once in the last ten days. He never regrets his choices because of what he is going through.																						
43	43		301									How would Captain Vera from Cerberus act?																						
44	44		301									Vera would look reluctant, but the truth is she would not stop fighting, Lucia thinks.																						
45	45		301								Lucia	Vera...	1

49	49		301							1		Vera was casually talking about her previous rescue missions on the transport craft back from Atlantis with the commandant.																						
50	50		301									Once, Vera found herself at a place where search and rescue equipment was not operable, but a sheepdog by her side helped her find the target.																						
51	51		301									It was because of that story that Lucia and Liv managed to find the pregnant Fantine at the ruins with the help of Matches.																						
52	52		301									As Lucia fights the endless horde of Hetero-Creatures, fragments of her memories flash by her M.I.N.D. like a merry-go-round.

57	57		301									The other teams might not be here, but Lucia believes that every one of them would have made the same choice.																						
58	58		301									Even Vanessa, whose whereabouts are unknown, has chosen this path not long ago.																						
59	59		301									Each of them has someone or something they want to protect, and each of them has fought until their very last breath.																						
60	60		301								Lucia	We do not regret...	1																					
61	61		301									But the world is not merciful.																						
62	62		301									Cutting down the enemies before her, Lucia looks around at the more Hetero-Creatures yet to come.

64	64		301									Her frame is pushed to the brink, her Inver-Device at the threshold. Lucia estimates that she has ten minutes before she stops moving.																						
65	65		301			PanelActor1Shake				1	Lucia	I won't stop even if I only have ten minutes left.	1																					
66	66		301									Her belief will be with her until her last moment.																						
67	67		401							2	1515																							
68	68		301									As if her determination is being rewarded, she hears a voice on the Gray Raven comms channel, one that she has not heard in a while.

72	72		301								Liv	Lucia!																						
73	73		301								Liv	What's happening? Why can't I see you on comms? Where's Lee? Why couldn't I contact you before?																						
74	74		301									The monitor on the comms is not showing anything. Lucia cannot see Liv, and Liv cannot see her.																						
75	75		301									That is because the moment she hears Liv's voice, Lucia immediately covers the terminal. She does not want Liv to see her like this.																						
76	76		301									And maybe Lucia's terminal was damaged during the battles, so she cannot see Liv on it as well.																						
77	77		301									But that is fine. Despite not being able to see Liv, it is good enough to hear her voice in the end, Lucia thinks.																						
78	78		301								Lucia	Are you still on Babylonia?	1																					
79	79		301								Liv	I'm on a transport craft to you. I'll be there soon.																						
80	80		301								Lucia	No, don't come here. It's too dangerous.	1																					
81	81		301								Liv	Lucia? What's going on? Why is it dangerous?																						
82	82		301								Lucia	...	1																					
83	83		301								Liv	It's okay, you don't have to worry about me. Do you remember the weapon President Hassen mentioned before I left? It's done.																						
84	84		301								Liv	It doesn't matter how dangerous it is. I can protect you.																						
85	85		301								Liv	...I can do it now, Lucia! Please, believe me!																						
86	86		301								Lucia	...	1																					
87	87		301								Lucia	...How long until you reach us?	1																					
88	88		301								Liv	It... should take another hour.																						
89	89		301								Lucia	An hour...	1																					
90	90		301									...It is too late.																						
91	91		301								Liv	What's wrong? Why aren't you saying anything?																						
92	92		301									If she cannot change the ending, then at least she can go accompanied by Liv's gentle voice.																						
93	93		301								Lucia	Can I...	1																					
94	94		301								Liv	Huh?																						
95	95		301								Lucia	...Can I hear you sing one more time?	1																					
96	96		301								Liv	What? Lucia... why are you...																						
97	97		301								Lucia	Think of it as a countdown. I'll feel more assured if I can hear your voice when I fight.	1																					
98	98		301								Lucia	When your song is close by, I'll know you're near.	1																					
99	99		301								Liv	Lucia...																						
100	100		301								Lucia	And Liv... sing it to Commandant someday, okay?	1																					
101	101		301								Liv	...																						
102	102		301								Liv	Lucia...																						
103	103		301									Has she realized the situation Lucia is in? Lucia can hear her gentle voice shaking.																						
104	104		301								Lucia	I'm sorry... it's untoward to ask you to sing mid-flight.	1																					
105	105		301								Liv	No...																						
106	106		301								Liv	...It's the only thing I can do before I reach you.																						
107	107		301								Liv	Let me stand by you this way.																						
108	108		301								Liv	But you have to promise me that you will keep yourself safe and never give up.																						
109	109		301								Liv	Hold on until I get there. I will be able to help.																						
110	110		301								Lucia	You have always been able to help, Liv.	1																					
111	111		301									In order to keep Liv from being more worried, Lucia tries her best to chuckle.	1																					
112	112		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Then... I'll be waiting for you here.	1
