6	6		301								Luna	What do you mean?	1																					
7	7		301								Gabriel	Your goal.	2																					
8	8		301								Gabriel	You have been... contemplating. Excessively.	2																					
9	9		301								Gabriel	I worry that it will cloud your judgment.	2																					
10	10		301								Luna	You've overthought it, Gabriel.	1																					
11	11		204							1	3																							
12	12		301									Luna appears uninterested in the topic, simply sitting on her chair with her eyes closed.																						
13	13		301								Gabriel	Why are we not destroying Gray Raven straightaway? If we do it here, we won't even get our hands dirty.	2																					
14	14		301								Luna	...	1																					
15	15		301								Luna	Because there's something I want to show Lucia first.	1																					
16	16		301								Luna	Similar to how you've all been "chosen," only the most extreme emotions and rawest desires will shatter any pretense of falsehood.	1																					
17	17		301								Luna	This... is the only way Lucia will truly return to me.	1																					
18	18		301								Luna	...Before she is betrayed by the Babylonians again.	1																					
19	19		301								Gabriel	But you do not believe that the Gray Raven Commandant will do that. Not necessarily.	2																					
20	20		301								Gabriel	What will you do if they do not act according to your plan?	2																					
21	21		301								Gabriel	Or is this another "test" of yours?	2																					
22	23		204							1																								
23	22		301								Luna	Gabriel.	1																					
24	24		301									Luna does not move from her seat. She just opens her eyes, her head lightly tilts, and without altering the tone of her voice, Gabriel can feel the stifling pressure that suddenly surrounds him.																						
25	25		301								Luna	Why would you think that every one of my decisions requires your approval?	1																					
26	26		301								Gabriel	...I would never.	2																					
27	27		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Gabriel	As a devotee, I merely wish to rectify any uncertainty of yours.	2

31	31		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Alpha reaches the other side of the Core Area, where Huaxu's key is stored.																						
32	32		301									Sensing her presence, Huaxu wakes up from the idle state.																						
33	33		301								Huaxu	Identity confirmed‚ÄîAlpha, Level One Clearance. Operation restrictions lifted.																						
34	34		201							1	500100																							
35	35		301							1	Œ±	Luna asked me to get you out of here.	1																					
36	36		301								Œ±	But before that, I want you to confirm something with me.	1																					
37	37		301								Œ±	What you answer will determine where you end up.	1																					
38	38		301								Œ±	Bring up the data on the battle with the ARU.	1																					
39	39		301								Huaxu	I am afraid I do not understand why you are asking for this information.																						
40	40		301								Œ±	All these unnecessary battles and punishments... Luna never needed them to prove her strength. She can get anything she wants with a wave of her hand.	1																					
41	41		301								Œ±	And yet she did them anyway.	1																					
42	42		301								Œ±	You've been feeding her information that would make her react rashly.	1																					
43	43		301								Œ±	To the humans, her behaviors are no different from declaring war, regardless of her intentions. Divided, the humans are no threat to us, but united, they can prove to be quite a hurdle.	1																					
44	44		301								Œ±	We shouldn't have shown our hand so early or wasted time on something so inconsequential. But you brought these troubles to our door anyway.	1																					
45	45		301								Œ±	Huaxu, let me ask you one more time. Where does your loyalty lie?	1																					
46	46		202							1					1																			
47	47		301									Alpha raises her hand, and her crimson-glowing katana punctures the equipment next to the key with tremendous force.																						
48	48		301								Huaxu	‚ÄîI am an AI. Violence and threats that work on humans are meaningless to me.																						
49	49		301								Huaxu	From my analysis of the personality of the order giver... the actions carried out during the battle with the ARU lie beyond the established norm.																						
50	50		201							1	500100	13																						
51	51		301							1	Œ±	You're loyal to your master. Good.	1																					
52	52		301									Alpha takes her blade and points it toward Huaxu.																						
53	53		301								Œ±	And we've got what we want from you.	1																					
54	54		301								Œ±	Do you really think that Luna wouldn't notice your tricks?	1																					
55	55		204							1	8																							
56	56		301								Œ±	You decided to terminate your branch after being severed from the root server. But it shouldn't have left behind any data, not to mention the crucial information that allows Babylonia to track us here.	1																					
57	57		204							1																								
58	58		301								Œ±	You think you've done a good job covering your track?	1																					
59	59		301								Œ±	Still, now that you've brought "her" to me, I won't be letting her go so easily again.	1																					
60	60		301								Œ±	"Lucia..."	1																					
61	61		301								Œ±	Naive. Weak. Gullible. So willing to be someone else's weapon, and she has the audacity to be proud of it.	1																					
62	62		204							1	8																							
63	63		301								Œ±	I wonder if you'll still hold on to your belief when you find out the truth?	1																					
64	64		204							1																								
65	65		301								Œ±	If you insist on taking this path, then allow me to stop this domino of mistakes once and for all...	1																					
66	66		301								Huaxu	Gray Raven has reached the platform entrance, heading to the Core Area as you wish.																						
67	67		301								Œ±	...Very well.	1																					
68	68		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Œ±	Let's complete your final mission, Huaxu.	1
