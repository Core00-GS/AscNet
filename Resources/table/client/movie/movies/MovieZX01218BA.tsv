18	11		301									The rudderless Corrupted begin to run amok, driven not by purpose, but by their killer instinct. Kowloong can only reinforce their defenses.

22	16		301								Chrome	Perhaps. But we only got rid of one of the Ascendants...	2																					
23	17		301								Kamui	But before she left, that fish lady mentioned something about Roland retreating.	1																					
24	18		301								Chrome	Even that only makes two. Gabriel, Alpha, and according to the report, their leader, Luna, might still be here somewhere.	2																					
25	19		301								Chrome	We can't let our guard down until we get a visual confirmation. Kamui, let's keep searching.	2

35	27		301								Chrome	I've read about you before. Do you require our help?	2																					
36	28		301								Bridget	Not me. It's Lucia, member of Gray Raven, that's asking for help.	3																					
37	29		204							1	5																							
38	30		301								Kamui	Gray Raven? What happened to them?	1																					
39	31		301								Bridget	They seem to be trapped inside the core area, you know, through that light wall. After losing contact with them for a while, the president got Lucia a new frame and sent her after them.	3																					
40	32		301								Kamui	Losing contact...? Could they be in danger? And how did Lucia get separated from the squad?	1																					
41	33		301								Bridget	It's a long story. Anyway, the clock is ticking—	3																					
42	34		301								Bridget	Lucia has been assigned an aircraft for this mission, and now she's on her way over. Could you please find a way to crack the light wall open ASAP so she could enter the core area?	3																					
43	35		204							1	4																							
44	36		301								Kamui	Yes, you can count on us.	1																					
45	37		301								Bridget	The aircraft is armed, but the gear is unlikely to do any damage to the wall. We'll be counting on you!	3

52	41		301								Chrome	At least wait until we get more info. Do you even know how to get the wall open?	2																					
53	42		301								Kamui	Uh... Good people of Kowloong? A clue maybe?	1																					
54	43		301									Kamui casually directs the question at the Kowloong guards next to him. Though they did fight together, the guards are still trying their best to avoid unnecessary contact with outsiders.

65	48		301									Without any hesitation, Kamui bows, pleading for the guards to tell him how to open the light wall. Chrome follows suit.

69	50		301									Without so much as a glance at the two, the guard captain begins talking, pointing at the explosives originally prepared for battle.																						
70	51		301								Guard Captain	Lady Qu is the only person who can open the light wall. But apparently, you can also use powerful explosives to create temporary cracks in the wall.	1																					
71	52		301								Guard Captain	With so many Corrupted running around, there's no telling if they might cause something to blow up.	1
