10	10		301									With Nanami's help, Martin successfully shot down several aircraft that were passing by. Nanami left a while ago to make sure the aircrew and the passengers were safe, and has now returned to Martin.																						
11	11		301									Nanami's question puts Martin in confusion. He plops himself onto the ground, looking lost.																						
12	12		201							1	500211																							
13	13		301							1	Martin	I can't receive any commands from the mother-frame. I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing now.	1																					
14	14		201							1	500091	8																						
15	15		301							1	Nanami	Receiving commands... Matty, are you a sub-unit under some big ol' mecha-lecker?	1																					
16	16		201							1	500211																							
17	17		301							1	Martin	Nanami, you know your stuff! But I guess, technically, we aren't really sub-units, more just Amberia's subordinate but independent frames.	1																					
18	18		201							1	500091																							
19	19		301							1	Nanami	Hmm... So this Amberia is the mother-frame you just mentioned?	1																					
20	20		201							1	500211																							
21	21		301							1	Martin	Yeah. All arctic bionics come from the same production line, and we all have a specialized receiver device installed.	1																					
22	22		301								Martin	This device allows us to receive the thoughts and feelings‚Äîthe commands‚Äîof our mother-frame, Amberia.	1																					
23	23		301								Martin	We all have independent minds on paper, but we're made so that Amberia can expropriate our frames through her commands at any time. Shooting down those aircraft was the last one I received.	1																					
24	24		201							1	500091																							
25	25		301							1	Nanami	So... that Amberia has been controlling you all since like, forever?	1																					
26	26		201							1	500211																							
27	27		301							1	Martin	Uh-huh. Before my receiver broke, I was just fighting against the ARU sort of in a daze... But then the thing broke during the last retreat.	1																					
28	28		201							1	500091	1																						
29	29		301							1	Nanami	Ahah. Nanami sees it now. Bionics and the ARU are enemies, yeah?	1																					
30	30		201							1	500211																							
31	31		301							1	Martin	Well, or more specifically‚ÄîAmberia and the ARU are enemies... But I know little about the history of it. When my receiver broke, I think I lost some data about us bionics.	1																					
32	32		201							1	500091	1																						
33	33		301							1	Nanami	Huh... Let's put aside what kinda bone this Amberia's got with the ARU-ru-ru... If the bionics and the humans go wangling their jangles around here, it'll just end in disaster for both of 'em!	1																					
34	34		301								Nanami	Okay then! Nanami jury has reached a verdict!	1																					
35	35		201							1	500211																							
36	36		301							1	Martin	...What kind of mess are you trying to make this time?	1																					
37	37		201							1	500091	1																						
38	38		301							1	Nanami	I'll go find Amberia, and convince her to stop making you attack humans!	1																					
39	39		201							1	500211																							
40	40		301							1	Martin	...Do you even know where Amberia is?	1																					
41	41		201							1	500091	1																						
42	42		301							1	Nanami	Don't you, Matty?	1																					
43	43		201							1	500211																							
44	44		301							1	Martin	Don't think so. Her location was part of the data I lost.	1																					
45	45		201							1	500091	8																						
46	46		301							1	Nanami	Awwwww. Fine! Then I'll just get everyone else to stop fighting instead! You just needa lob 'em receivers off, right?!	1																					
47	47		201							1	500211																							
48	48		301							1	Martin	That... may stop us from fighting with the humans, but why would you do that?	1
