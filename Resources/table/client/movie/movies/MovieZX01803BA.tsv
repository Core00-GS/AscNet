24	24		301									However, the oppressive sense of urgency still remains. If it is from the Red Tide before, it is now from surviving in such hostile conditions.																						
25	25		301									From behind, you hear the whale song again. You are no longer in the area inundated by the Red Tide, and the sound takes on a more ethereal tone.

33	33		301								Ayla	She may be a starry-eyed idealist, but she's also the most pragmatic person I have ever met. When she acts mature, she's decisive to an extreme. When she acts naive, she's romantic to a fault.	1

42	42		301									The equatorial radius is 6378.137 kilometers. It rotates from west to east and revolves around the sun. It is the third innermost planet of the solar system...																						
43	43		301									It goes without saying that the feeling of gravity upon entering the atmosphere is always a memorable part of each mission.

45	45		301								Ayla	Is that all?	1																					
46	46		301								Ayla	The Task Force commandants often get deployed to the surface. I don't think most residents born in Babylonia will ever know what true gravity feels like.	1																					
47	47		301								Ayla	Some members of the archaeological team haven't even been to the surface.	1

139	139		301									Obviously, there is only one light source. When seen from Babylonia, it is merely just an incandescent ball of light. Yet, how can it illuminate such a vast land?

160	160		301									To one side, a ragged and close-knit group resembling refugees who have long since lived here.																						
161	161		301									To the other side, a fully armed squadron of elite soldiers sent from Babylonia.																						
162	162		301									The sudden appearance of the latter obviously frightened the former. Now at the breaking point, fear and vigilance have given way to unclad hostility.

167	167		301									The soldiers on the calibration team grip their weapons tightly.																						
168	168		201							1	500019																							
169	169		301							1	Construct A	Chief Commander, this camp and its people are near the preset coordinates. They'll be caught in the blast. Should we force them to evacuate?	1

243	243		201							1	500294																							
244	244		301							1	Old Man	Put simply, it's a giant bright light that destroys everything it shines light on.	1

268	268		301								Old Man	I told them exactly that.	2

273	273		301								Lee	Briefly put, this area will be overrun with Punishing creatures soon, so Babylonia wants to eliminate them all in one fell sweep.	1																					
274	274		301								Lee	One of the designated coordinates is near this camp. If you continue to stay here, you'll be caught in the shockwave.	1

279	279		301								Old Man	As the pride and hope of mankind, after so many years, you return to Earth only to bring us news of destruction.	1																					
280	280		301								Old Man	We know that you came here to destroy that red tide of monsters approaching from the west. We know what it is. Many of our comrades have fallen victim to it.	1																					
281	281		301								Old Man	When you mentioned the Longinus Arsenal, I already knew what repercussions we were going to face. That's what I told them.	1																					
282	282		301								Old Man	Your tactics have always been simple and crude. It was before and it still is. I'm not surprised.	1																					
283	283		301								Old Man	We will not obstruct your mission or interfere with the coordinates you set.	1

290	290		301								Old Man	If we die, so what?	1																					
291	291		301								Old Man	Look around you. This place is home to only a few hundred people scattered throughout.	1																					
292	292		301								Old Man	We've been through the Great Evacuation. When faced with impending doom, some people boarded Eden. While others just barely missed the boat.	1																					
293	293		301								Old Man	The former lives a life of ease aboard Eden, while the other is left to eke out a life among the remnants of civilization.	1																					
294	294		301								Old Man	Just look at the old veteran behind you. He no longer concerns himself with the likes of us after receiving his golden ticket onto that doomsday ark.	1

333	333		301								Hassen	Because I already relayed it to Hans. That will suffice.	1																					
334	334		301								Nikola	In some regards, you're even more ruthless than me.	2																					
335	335		301								Hassen	Hah... So, you know what our subordinates think of us too, eh?	1																					
336	338		301								Nikola	Of course. I'm not deaf, and I'm certainly not a fool.	2																					
337	339		301								Nikola	If it was really just a calibrating mission, then the Gray Raven Commandant would've been enough to serve as the chief commander.	2																					
338	340		301								Nikola	They've encountered the Red Tide before, and their experience in active combat far exceeds that of others.	2																					
339	341		301								Nikola	Yet you chose Hans.	2																					
340	345		301								Hassen	Since the last battle in City 075, the Gray Raven Commandant's condition has become unstable. Asimov still isn't sure whether it has had any permanent impact on 【kuroname】 either mentally or physically.	1																					
341	346		301								Hassen	Moreover, the objective of this operation isn't combative. Rather, it requires cooperation to achieve a strategic goal. Since the Gray Ravens are used to fighting in isolation, 【kuroname】 may not be the most suitable choice as chief commander.	1																					
342	347		301								Nikola	The suitability of the Gray Ravens isn't the reason why you selected Hans.	2																					
343	349		301									Hassen pauses a moment, then continues to speak.																						
344	351		301								Hassen	Some decisions and responsibilities cannot be left to the younger generation.	1																					
345	352		301								Hassen	Even if there is only the slightest of risk.	1																					
346	353		301								Hassen	I trust Hans' judgment. He is our most prominent leader. He has enough experience to deal with any unforeseen issue that should arise.	1																					
347	357		301								Nikola	You're too kind and gentle to the younger generation.	2																					
348	358		301								Nikola	If you keep sheltering them, it will only backfire.	2																					
349	359		301								Hassen	Nikola, you and I have too much weight on our shoulders and too much blood on our hands.	1																					
350	360		301								Hassen	Friend and foe alike.	1																					
351	361		301								Hassen	We are remnants of the past. One day, history will use the guillotine to judge those disgraceful sins.	1																					
352	362		301								Hassen	At least spare the children from having to bear the responsibilities and sins of their forefathers.	1																					
353	363		301								Hassen	Our generation will be the one to sever the chains of hatred.	1																					
354	364		301								Nikola	In that case, why let them go down together?	2																					
355	367		301								Hassen	First and foremost, to observe whether 【kuroname】 is still suitable for serving as Gray Raven's commandant.	1																					
356	368		301								Hassen	Secondly... Sparing them from our responsibility doesn't mean asking them to turn a blind eye forever.	1
