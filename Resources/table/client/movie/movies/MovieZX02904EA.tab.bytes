11	11		301								Young Man A	I fought a whole lot.	1																					
12	12		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Young Man A	...I was part of the Cargo Crew... and I was the captain of Crew 08...	1																					
13	13		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				When it comes to ACA, people think about all the different classes of cars on Asslam.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory447.jpg		1																			
14	14		304							The class that occupies the greatest area isn't the "upper level"‚Äîto which the Noble Carriage, the functional car, and the guest car belong.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory447.jpg		1																			
15	15		304							But rather, the "lower level"‚Äîto which the Cargo Carriage, the Commoner Carriage, and the Industrial Carriage belong.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory447.jpg		1																			
16	16		304							The Commoner Carriage is a congregation of regular people with skills.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory447.jpg		1																			
17	17		304							They make up the Logistics Crew, Maintenance Crew, Cargo Crew, and the Bumblebee‚Äîsomething unique to ACA.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory447.jpg		1																			
18	18		304							Before the Bumblebee saw an expansion in its number of members, the majority living on the lower level of Asslam belonged to the Cargo Crew.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory447.jpg		1																			
19	19		304							Because of the Punishing Virus, however, machines are no longer omnipotent, and the streets now abound with Corrupted, robbers, and ruins.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory447.jpg		1																			
20	20		304							To keep the circulation of items and mail alive and to help resume trading in a world on the verge of destruction...	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory447.jpg		1																			
21	21		304							ACA formed a logistics network with the Cargo Crew‚Äîalong with sheer hard work and some homespun transport vehicles.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory447.jpg		1		1																	
22	22		304							They recycle resources produced by the reservation area, bases, and some rebuilt factories...	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory447.jpg		1																			
23	23		304							And occasionally either sell them to other places, or have the Bumblebee process them again, and then sell the final products.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory447.jpg		1																			
24	24		304							To many bases, the Cargo Crew is a sign of hope‚Äîbecause they come with much-needed supplies and take away with them what isn't needed.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory447.jpg		1																			
25	25		304							They help homeless merchants keep their heads above the water, and many times they've come to rescue when people were in dire situations.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory447.jpg		1																			
26	26		304							Most importantly, they brought a ridiculous amount of wealth to the aristocrats living on the upper level.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory447.jpg		1																			
27	27		304							The job is dangerous, and one might often face either robbers or the Corrupted, and that's when they might lose their goods or their life.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory447.jpg		1																			
28	28		304				AniZhuanchangBegin			Still, the job was a dream job to many homeless Scavengers‚Äîuntil what happened back then, that is.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory447.jpg		1			1																
29	29		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Young Man A	Was...?	1																					
30	30		301									Something doesn't seem right‚Äîand it rolls around in his M.I.N.D. like a glass ball.																						
31	31		301									At some point, people stopped seeing the job as a dream job‚Äîbut as a symbol of slavery and sucking-up, rather.																						
32	32		301								Young Man A	What happened back then...?	1																					
33	33		301								Young Man A	That's why... That's why Rachel said she was going to strike the aristocrats with a revolution for those living on the lower level...	1																					
34	34		301								Young Man A	Did she manage to pull it off, though?	1																					
35	35		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					The boy tries to recall what happened‚Äîonly to realize that his memory takes him no further.
