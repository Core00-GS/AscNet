4	4		301							1	Bianca	Where is this...?	1																					
5	5		301									When everything finally calmed down, Bianca saw a wetland.																						
6	6		202							1					1																			
7	7		301									As far as she could see, there was only greenery and mud. Fallen leaves and new buds scattered on the swamp. A few insect sounds could be heard every now and then.																						
8	8		301									A grassland not far away was covered in white.																						
9	9		301								Crane	Whoop—																						
10	10		301									It was cranes, tens of live cranes gathering over the swamp.																						
11	11		301								Crane	Whoop—																						
12	12		301								Crane	Whoop—whoop—																						
13	13		301									Bianca heard a few cries from the sedge. Unlike the audio file, they sounded more ear-piercing, but quickly weakened.																						
14	14		201							1	500128																							
15	15		301							1		Even without necessary knowledge, Bianca could sense exhaustion, restlessness and discomfort in their sounds. She knew that in the time of war, making such sounds would only wear them down sooner, and eventually lead to extinction as humans no longer had the luxury to provide necessary care.																						
16	16		202							1					1																			
17	17		301								Crane	Whoop—whoop—																						
18	18		301									Suddenly, one of the cranes made another clear whoop, not as sharp but louder than any others.																						
19	19		301									The sound had a mechanical texture.																						
20	20		301									Bianca saw a pair of raising wings, giving a silver shine under the sun.																						
21	21		301									It was a bionic machine. Its mechanical voice overwhelmed all the other cries.																						
22	22		301									The voice gradually soothed and ceased, which reminded Bianca of the lullaby that she heard in Babylonia. The mechanical crane then pulled one leg back, burying its head in its wings.																						
23	23		301									The "lullaby" was only met by more noisy screaming in the beginning. The few loudest cranes seemed to be upset and gathered near the mechanical crane, knocking it with their long bills.																						
24	24		301									But as it continues, a couple of cranes begin to mimic the mechanoid's pose, awkwardly curling up their legs and resting their heads on the body. It is the most suitable position for them to rest.																						
25	25		301									Soon, more cranes began to follow, until Bianca saw a group of resting cranes, a common sight in the database.																						
26	26		301									The restless cranes are comforted by the mechanical crane's voice.																						
27	27		201							1	500128																							
28	28		301							1	Bianca	...The CTO mentioned Toniris was based on a bionic machine in the Golden Age.	1																					
29	29		301								Bianca	Is this a recording of you and your friends?	1																					
30	30		202							1					1																			
31	31		301									During the Golden Age, the earth was overdeveloped and animals could only be kept in nature reserves.																						
32	32		301									Humans "blessed" them with stable environments and food supplies, which made them forget their nature over time.																						
33	33		301									Without such blessings, the animals were extremely fragile in the wilderness during the Post-Pandemic Age as they lost all the instincts.																						
34	34		301									—But they survived.																						
35	35		301									They managed to survive till today. Until recently, Bianca heard rumors about the sighting of cranes on the earth.																						
36	36		301									A group of bionic machines kept them alive.																						
37	37		301									They were originally allocated in the natural reserve with the duty to maintain the environment and monitor the health of live animals.																						
38	38		301									When animals were left in the wild to survive, these bionic animals became their protectors.																						
39	39		301									They taught the cranes how to open their wings, as well as how to find the air holes left by shellfish in the riverbed when taking a walk.																						
40	40		301									Migration, foraging, avoiding enemies... The bionic machines slowly awakened the animals' forgotten instincts, teaching them how to survive on their natural perception.																						
41	41		301									They were different from their peers right from the beginning. When humans stopped giving them orders, they still continued the seemingly meaningless guide duty.																						
42	42		301									When all beliefs were long gone, what could her prayers possibly do?																						
43	43		301									But even if it made no sense, the action itself still became a symbol. A symbol that could make changes happen.																						
44	44		201							1	500128																							
45	45		301							1	Bianca	I see... You're just like me. They didn't understand you. They thought you were different. But you were still guiding them in your own way.	1																					
46	46		301								Bianca	You worked until the very last moment. When you heard the other cranes, you thought you were back...	1																					
47	47		301								Bianca	You've done a lot, Toniris...	1																					
48	48		301									The bionic crane raised its head as if it had heard Bianca from afar. It made a gentle tweet and went back to rest.																						
49	49		301									Next, the steel leg supporting its body collapsed, and it broke into many pieces. Bianca saw the rust on its body even from a distance.																						
50	50		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The holographic scene reverted to data streams. Gone were the grass, the cranes, and the blue sky.

53	53		201							1	500312																							
54	54		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		Only Toniris was left there, standing at where the bionic crane fell.																						
55	55		301									Bianca gently touched its body.																						
56	56		301									She does not send a connection request, only stroking along its body like patting a nestling.																						
57	57		202							1					1																			
58	58		301								Comms	Miss Bianca... Can you hear me...																						
59	59		301									Bianca was alerted after hearing the voice in the comms channel.																						
60	60		201							1	500128																							
61	61		301							1	Bianca	What is it?	1																					
62	62		202							1					1																			
63	63		301								Comms	Lots of Corrupted are approaching your location!																						
64	64		301								Comms	I have contacted other squads... But there is still a massive amount of signals heading your way!																						
65	65		301								Comms	It is impossible for one Construct to face them.																						
66	66		201							1	500128																							
67	67		301							1	Bianca	...	1																					
68	68		202							1					1																			
69	69		301								Comms	S-sorry. I should have been more proactive and worked with you. You could have escaped...																						
70	70		201							1	500128																							
71	71		301							1	Bianca	That's okay.	1																					
72	72		202							1					1																			
73	73		301								Comms	No, it's not!																						
74	74		301								Comms	Miss Bianca, you are different from other Purifying Force members. I know this sounds very abrupt...																						
75	75		301								Comms	But I don't want you to die.																						
76	76		301								Comms	There are so many jerks out there that deserve death. Why? Why do you have to face this? You are so kind and resilient...																						
77	77		201							1	500128																							
78	78		301							1	Bianca	...	1																					
79	79		301								Bianca	Is that what you are hoping for?	1																					
80	80		202							1					1																			
81	81		301								Comms	Huh?																						
82	82		201							1	500128	1																						
83	83		301							1	Bianca	I'm just being thorough. You said one Construct couldn't face them alone, right?	1																					
84	84		301								Bianca	But it's not just a Construct here.	1																					
85	85		202							1					1																			
86	86		301								Comms	Whaaat?																						
87	87		301									Numerous Corrupted swarm across the horizon. They soon discover Bianca with her human-like consciousness, and rush directly toward her.																						
88	88		301									Bianca does not move. Instead, she pulls her bow and starts attacking the Corrupted.																						
89	89		201							1	500312																							
90	90		301							1		Toniris opened her wings elegantly, hovering in mid-air and crying out. For one split second, Bianca thought the church was struck by thunder.																						
91	91		301									Maybe her "Veritas" also formed part of the roaring thunder.																						
92	92		201							1	500128	1																						
93	93		301							1	Bianca	Now I understand why you didn't want other Constructs to connect to you.	1																					
94	94		301								Bianca	Individuals who are always rejected will tend to alienate themselves in return. They get tired of explaining themselves, and refrain from unnecessary contact or conversations...	1																					
95	95		301								Bianca	You were one such individual among the cranes. None of your kin could understand you. That's why I know exactly what you are thinking.	1																					
96	96		301								Bianca	Because I'm no different...	1																					
97	97		301									Bianca closed her eyes and recalled the looks on other Constructs when she wanted to pay her tribute in the funeral, and the fear in the voice of the coordinator over the line earlier.																						
98	98		301									She also remembered that formal, pretentious "professional" she had to fake.																						
99	99		301								Bianca	...But even though our actions were not understood, we still managed to protect the "present" that we wanted to cherish.	1																					
100	100		301								Bianca	You have done a lot in the "past." Would you like to join me to protect the "future" of our friends?	1																					
101	101		301									Bianca calls Toniris's name. Her call is not loud, but she stops Toniris's cry.																						
102	102		201							1	500312																							
103	103		301							1	Toniris	...	1																					
104	104		301									Toniris' head slowly turned to Bianca and stopped for a few seconds, as if it was staring at her through those tiny eyes.																						
105	105		301									Bianca rests her hand on the bottom of Toniris' neck. She quietly looks it in the eyes, and initiates the connection once again.																						
106	106		301									This time, she does not create a direct connection, but many mini-handshake requests, trying to stimulate a reaction.																						
107	107		201							1	500128																							
108	108		301							1	Bianca	"Give me your plume, and we shall walk together."	1																					
109	109		301									Bianca whispered in a prayer tone, calling for another being in the world that had the patience to listen to her.																						
110	110		301									Soon, she felt a slight shock in her palm.																						
111	111		301									Along with energy injected from the wings.																						
112	112		301									It felt massive but calm, like a thunder slowly building up.																						
113	113		301								Bianca	...Thank you.	1																					
114	114		301									She let her hands slide down the wings, then picked up her familiar weapon.																						
115	115		301									"When God stands, he creates a field of peace. Holy light shines upon, cleansing all his enemies."																						
116	116		301									Now a Construct and a mechanoid had such holy light in their hands.																						
117	117		301								Bianca	Charging complete.	1																					
118	118		301									The long bow bent to her hand, lightning gathering in front. One could easily mistake it for holy light in her hand.																						
119	119		301									She never felt her arrow so light.																						
120	120		301									The Combat Unit Booster's connection makes the lightning bolt as light as a wooden arrow. The enormous energy can be triggered at any time.																						
121	121		301									The relentless Corrupted storm through the church's broken door, facing Bianca.																						
122	122		301								Bianca	In the name of the Lord... We shall bring you eternal peace.	1																					
123	123		301									She inhales a deep breath and releases her finger. Toniris calls nearby.																						
124	124		202							1					1																			
125	125		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					The lightning bolt launched from her bow, bringing destruction to their enemies.
