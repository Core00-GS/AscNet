7	5		301							1	Karenina	Why do you say that?	2																					
8	6		301								Camu	Just based on my experience. I have seen similar plots in the games that Kamui played.	1																					
9	7		301								Camu	The humble-looking King could actually be the final Boss.	1																					
10	2003		302								That's a lot of detail!	8	I don't think Hassen is like that.	9																				
11	8	10	301								Camu	Details are always good. They help us to locate the objective. Don't you think?	1																					
12	9	10	301								Camu	Remember, this is a game. That wasn't the real Hassen.	1																					
13	10		301								Camu	I kind of learned what type of person Celica was yesterday. This King is probably set like Hassen in purpose to make others think he is a good guy.	1																					
14	11		301								Karenina	A disguise, huh? Are you saying this Hassen is evil, and the Demons are good?	2																					
15	2004		302								Both can be evil though.	1001	Are you so sure that Hassen is evil?	1004

23	13	14	301							1	Vera	A good ruler doesn't necessarily have to be kind, but he must let others fear his authority. That Hassen apparently failed to do so.	3																					
24	14	15	301								Karenina	Yeah, no matter what we said, he was always smiling. Disgusting.	2																					
25	15		301								Vera	So why didn't we just beat that Hassen up? If he was evil, we could have skipped a lot of hassle.	3																					
26	16		301								Camu	He had no HP bar.	1																					
27	17		301								Karenina	HP bar... What is that?	2																					
28	18		301								Camu	Remember the enemies we fought earlier on? I could check their status and remaining health through the system, but not NPCs like Hassen.	1																					
29	19		301								Camu	They were not configured as enemies that we could attack.	1																					
30	20		301								Camu	This is a game. Even if we can attack him, if he has no HP bar, he "cannot" be killed.	1																					
31	21		301								Karenina	...How are we going to deal with enemies like that?	2																					
32	22		301								Camu	There are many ways, but all are up to the game settings, we can't really change that from our end.	1																					
33	23		301								Vera	How annoying... Anyway, let's focus on the Demons and Liv now.	3																					
34	24		301								Camu	True. But if my guess is right, Hassen should be the final Boss.	1																					
35	25		301								Vera	What a boring plot.	3																					
36	26		301									The three villain Constructs kept attacking the old-school plot and inappropriate game settings, as if they were professional game designers.																						
37	27		301									Which completely destroyed the unfortunate listener's interests and dreams.

43	29		301							1	Vera	So this must be one of those compulsory fights. Well, Commandant of Gray Raven, now is your time to shine. Make sure we clear in the first attempt!	1																					
44	2009		302								Just do whatever you want.	30	Alright, leave it to me.	3000																				
45	30		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Vera	Fine, we don't need a stable mind to unlock our full strength here. Just hide somewhere safe, okay?	1
