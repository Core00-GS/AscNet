3	3		301			DialogEnable						The city you are walking through is eerily silent. All you can hear is the snowfall and the wind howling.																						
4	4		302								Huff... Puff... A-are we there yet?	5																						
5	5		201							2	1091001																							
6	6		301							1	Bianca	We are close, Commandant.	2																					
7	7		301								Bianca	It's already the middle of the night. I'm not sure if you are accustomed to the temperature. And the continuous battles... must be weighing on you.	2																					
8	8		301									With Bianca leading you, your journey to meet Karenina has been fairly calm.																						
9	9		301									On her own, Karenina seems to be less forceful and odd than usual.																						
10	10		301								Bianca	Karen, what are you doing here?	2																					
11	11		301									Her hood is covered with a thin layer of snow. It appears that she has been waiting for quite a while.

14	14		301							1	Karenina	Bianca's capabilities aside, the fact that you've arrived with 【kuroname】in one piece tells me that someone's not being a giant pain in the butt.	1																					
15	15		301									Although her expression is as animated as ever, you can tell that Karenina is purposefully lowering her voice.																						
16	16		301								Bianca	What's our situation here, Karen?	2																					
17	17		301									Karenina holds her finger to her lips, indicating you to be quiet.																						
18	18		301									Your eyes follow the direction she is pointing, and you find the CUB hovering, perfectly still, as if monitoring something.																						
19	19		301								Karenina	I did discover some unusual tracks, which was why I ran off earlier. But things aren't what I expected.	1																					
20	20		301								Karenina	I've discovered a trail that suggests a mechanoid on the move from where we are to where the CUB is. That's how I put all our clues together...	1

22	22		401							1	201																							
23	23		301									As she speaks, you hear a low-frequency warning broadcasted from where the CUB is hovering.

26	26		301									Karenina is the first to respond. She jumps to her feet and dashes toward the CUB.																						
27	27		302								Where are you going, Karenina?																							
28	28		301								Bianca	I've set the CUB to hunt mode. You don't need to rush!	2																					
29	29		202							2					1																			
30	30		301									Bianca raises her voice toward Karenina to no avail. Frustrated, she also chases after her.																						
31	31		201							1	1111001																							
32	32		301							1	Karenina	Stop wasting time—【kuroname】! Follow!	1																					
33	33		301									Karenina turns to look at you confidently.																						
34	34		301								Karenina	Stamina shouldn't be a problem for you?	1																					
35	35		302								...Of course not!	36	I'm only human!	37																				
36	36	38	301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Karenina	Keep up, then!	1																					
37	37		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Karenina	You can rest afterward! I'll see you at the finish line!	1

44	44		301								Strange Voice	～Where are you from?～																						
45	45		301								Strange Voice	～Do roses bloom in your garden?～																						
46	46		301								Strange Voice	～And where are you going?～																						
47	47		301								Strange Voice	～When you wake, do people sing?～																						
48	48		301									The young girl softly hums her made-up melody, her delightful voice sounding especially pleasant in the calm and silent ruins.																						
49	49		301									Behind the singing girl inside the shadow, however, lurks a chilling presence.																						
50	50		301									The girl is not concerned, or maybe she has not noticed the sound of mechanical parts slowly approaching.																						
51	51		301									...																						
52	52		301									...																						
53	53		302								That voice... sounds familiar...	54

56	56		301							1	Karenina	It's her!	1																					
57	57		301								Karenina	Commandant! Take cover!	1																					
58	58		301									As if she has noticed something, Karenina strikes proactively. Her CUB also activates at the same moment.																						
59	59		301									Karenina becomes extra nervous as she notices who her targets are surrounding.																						
60	60		301									It is indeed a familiar voice—perhaps that is why Karenina is so eager to chase her down in the first place.																						
61	61		301								Karenina	Bianca, I'll count on your support!	1																					
62	62		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Karenina	Hey! We're coming to save you!	1
