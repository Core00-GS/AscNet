53	53		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Hearing Lee's desperate plea, Shrek smiles.																						
54	54		301								Shrek	I was thinking... if those two monsters didn't avoid the handbag or the tumbling human...																						
55	55		301								Shrek	It stands to reason that they wouldn't duck from a guy with a handbag like me, no?																						
56	56		301									Hearing that, Lee finally notices that Shrek is holding onto the handbag with the masking device that Lee hid in the carriage earlier.																						
57	57		301								Lee	Enough with that nonsense...!																						
58	58		301								Lee	There are still other ways we haven't tried! Get up first, and we'll figure it out!																						
59	59		301								Shrek	But time's running out, isn't it? They've noticed the potential danger, and they're hesitant to mingle with us anymore.																						
60	60		301								Lee	Get up and we'll talk!																						
61	61		301								Lee	We're surrounded! I can't pull you up with my broken arm!																						
62	62		301									Standing at the edge above the speeding train, Lee is struggling to keep himself safe. All he can do is kick the approaching Hetero-Creatures away while pressing Shrek to save himself.																						
63	63		301								Lee	It's meaningless! You die, and you lose all possibilities!																						
64	64		301								Shrek	You're right...																						
65	65		301								Shrek	I had someone once. I lost her, and it was "meaningless," like you said.																						
66	66		301								Shrek	But her death changed me, you know?																						
67	67		301								Shrek	I became a novice medic because I regretted not being able to save her.																						
68	68		301								Shrek	I couldn't change the past, but I've saved a few people since she's gone.																						
69	69		301								Shrek	It's meaningless for the dead, sure, but my death has to amount to something for the living, right?																						
70	70		301								Lee	Enough! I told you to stop that nonsense!																						
71	71		301								Lee	I don't need your sacrifice for a mere chance...!																						
72	72		301								Shrek	Lee... you ought to be more honest with yourself.																						
73	73		301								Shrek	Otherwise, you're gonna regret it one day.																						
74	74		301								Lee	What are you talking about?																						
75	75		301								Shrek	Let me tell you a secret.																						
76	76		301								Shrek	Although I always bring bad luck to those near me, I'm unbelievably lucky myself.																						
77	77		301								Shrek	Even if you drop me here, I might still be able to walk out of this in one piece.																						
78	78		301								Shrek	Who knows, I might be standing before you with rainbow hair in a few days as a Construct.																						
79	79		301									Lee spends an extra 0.53 seconds to come up with a reply in the face of Shrek's absurdity.																						
80	80		301								Lee	I don't think the technicians are interested in making rainbow hair.																						
81	81		301									The wind breezes past them to somewhere beyond reach, chuckling like the young man hung by the edge.																						
82	82		301								Shrek	See, you're not dismissing the Construct part, impossible as it is.																						
83	83		301									Shrek begins to loosen his grip.																						
84	84		301								Shrek	I've been hoping to reunite with my friends since they passed.																						
85	85		301								Shrek	Not because I've decided to give up the possibility they gave me...																						
86	86		301								Shrek	I'm just making the same choice they did. I'm passing this ticket to the future to someone else.																						
87	87		301								Shrek	I finally understand...																						
88	88		301									Winter does not take, for some would light fires with their souls. Small and frail as their flames may be, they... are enough to light a fuse. All possibilities stem from a big bang, after all.																						
89	89		301								Lee	Stop talking! Get up, now!																						
90	90		301								Shrek	Thank you, Lee. But I think I've done almost everything I wanted to do. There's just one thing left.																						
91	91		301								Shrek	Forsaken, Babylonians... you all deserve to live. You live, and you save more lives, yeah?																						
92	92		301								Shrek	It's my genuine pleasure to have spent this time with you...																						
93	93		301								Shrek	So, this is my last wish. This is the reason why.																						
94	94		301									Shrek smiles, and he lets go of Lee's broken arm.																						
95	95		301								Lee	SHREK!!!																						
96	96		301								Shrek	...Until next time, kind stranger.

101	101		301			RImgBg1Shake						As the twins catch the tumbling young man unsuspectingly, Omega II finally unleashes its unmatched rage amidst the cries and roars.																						
102	102		301									The tunnel fully collapses at its impact, blocking off the barrage of Hetero-Creatures completely.																						
103	103		301									Countless charging monsters crash into the fallen debris, disintegrating into dust as they enter Omega II's domain.																						
104	104		301									The leaders of this mad tide of calamity wail as they examine their festering bodies. They flung the bloodied human in their hands toward the debris before them.																						
105	105		301									With twisted, frightened expressions, they stare at the blocked tunnel, the exit beyond their reach.

136	136		301									Would he consider it misfortune or luck?

138	138		301							1	Vonnegut	What an incredible will to live... Interesting.	1																					
139	139		301								Vonnegut	I didn't expect the twins to leave a "sample" behind. Seems like they're starting to have a will of their own.	1

143	143		301								Vonnegut	You mean the "fear" they instilled?	1																					
144	144		301									The dark figure walks back and forth before the ruins, observing the giant creature that once was lying not far away from them.																						
145	145		301								Vonnegut	It seems that the damaged Hive Mother... also sensed her children's "fear," rushing here from a nearby hive to their aid. Is that the maternal bond?	1																					
146	146		204							2	8																							
147	147		301								Cinderelik	...	2																					
148	148		301								Vonnegut	Are you feeling sad for her?	1																					
149	149		204							2																								
150	150		301								Cinderelik	No. She's just a vessel for data, a being that takes the role of a "mother." She isn't my real mom.	2																					
151	151		301								Cinderelik	Even if she would mimic my mom and speak the words she once said... I wouldn't feel sad for a vessel.	2																					
152	152		301								Cinderelik	Everything we're doing is for the day real mom and "Cinderelik" return.	2																					
153	153		301									She closes her eyes, her hands caressing the wings that once belonged to "Cinderelik" in order to conceal the despair that is about to burst through her heart.																						
154	154		301								Vonnegut	Are you thinking about that day?	1																					
155	155		301								Cinderelik	...I'm sorry.	2																					
156	156		301								Vonnegut	I'll give you your freedom once it's all over.	1

162	162		301								Cinderelik	I do.	2																					
163	163		301									The detached girl looks up at the dark shadow before her, as compliant as a rabbit.																						
164	164		301								Cinderelik	Whether he... whether Mr. Kugawa Kurono remembers killing mom... Whether he agrees with everything I've done...	2																					
165	165		301								Cinderelik	I want to see him again and tell him that mom has woken up.	2																					
166	166		301									The dark figure does not comment on the girl's wish. He acknowledges it plainly before gazing at the other end of the tunnel, like the two creatures who stood here did.																						
167	167		301								Vonnegut	They're back inside the Red Tide, aren't they?	1																					
168	168		301								Cinderelik	They are. The twins will need some time to recover.	2																					
169	169		301								Cinderelik	But the attack command on the three Constructs has yet to be lifted. The Hetero-Creatures will be hunting for those three.	2																					
170	170		301								Cinderelik	Should we follow?	2																					
171	171		301								Vonnegut	No... We should watch from the sideline until the end.	1																					
172	172		301								Cinderelik	The captain that you favor is among them too.	2																					
173	173		301								Vonnegut	Obstacles should clarify the current situation for him.	1																					
174	174		301								Vonnegut	We don't have to get involved in this game of survival.	1																					
175	175		301								Cinderelik	But the survivors have already left the damaged train, and they happen to be trapped at her...	2																					
176	176		301								Cinderelik	...At the church the Merciful One frequents...	2																					
177	177		301								Vonnegut	Oh? We don't have to interfere if she wants to get involved.	1																					
178	178		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Vonnegut	After all, she... is "oblivion" itself.	1
