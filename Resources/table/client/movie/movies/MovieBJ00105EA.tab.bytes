10	152		301									As the banging of the drums and gongs fades away into a gentle hum, the pulley for the curtains begins to move, grinding through yellowed rust and dried grease.																						
11	153		301									The pulley, rusty after fifty years of disuse, can no longer support the two-ton curtains. The set falls apart, slamming onto the stage, sending dust flying.

19	161		301									Bunshiro, for his part, remains unaffected. The feedback from his receiver tells him that the long-awaited end has finally come.
