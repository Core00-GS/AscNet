3	3		301			DialogEnable						It has been 15 days since the transport craft vanished into the sky.																						
4	4		301									Time is a pot that brews misery from the hunger and pain of those who have remained on the surface.																						
5	5		301									After the twins were hurt, they have since changed their course, heading north once again. This time, they are approaching from the plains on the east.																						
6	6		301									With the south returning to momentary peace, many without shelter have started gathering at the underground base of City 047.																						
7	7		301									Even with the many resources stored there, they will run out one day.																						
8	8		301									Having been informed about the presence of the barrage of Hetero-Creatures, most people want to depart the area to avoid exhausting the resources. Still, they are apprehensive about the regions without Constructs.																						
9	9		301									While everyone is at a loss, Gray Raven coordinates with the other elite squads and has Strike Hawk and Cerberus meet up with them in City 047, as the two teams switch their posts with other Constructs who have stayed behind.

13	13		301							1		Although they have not seen each other for a while, most of the three squads are in no mood to catch up, save a quick confirmation of each member's status and conditions.	1	2	3																			
14	14		301									Given the situation they are in, they can tell what each other has been through without needing to say anything.

27	27		301									The day after the catastrophe, Strike Hawk and Cerberus were both assigned missions to escort the transport crafts traveling between the surface and Babylonia.																						
28	28		301									In the beginning, the rate of successful rescues was high, with the elite squads leading the charge.																						
29	29		301									But even they could not withstand the many attacks mid-flight. Although they managed to protect the personnel, they could not save the transport craft from crashing to the ground.																						
30	30		301									They tried multiple times with little to no results, and so their escort missions turned into rescue missions on the surface.																						
31	31		301									At least the Constructs remaining here are safe, as well as Liv, who managed to return to Babylonia. That is all they can ask for.

37	37		301									Having checked everyone's status, the three captains assign the 687 people in City 047 into 8 platoons according to their expertise.																						
38	38		301									Each member of Gray Raven, Cerberus, and Strike Hawk will form a new squad with two other Constructs who have stayed behind, each squad leading a platoon to head for the different conservation areas.																						
39	39		301									In smaller groups, they are more capable of handling unexpected situations while reducing conflicts for scarce resources. If worst comes to worst, the loss will be minimal.																						
40	40		301									With everyone's agreement, people begin to collect their belongings before waiting outside the base, ready to follow the Constructs and leave.

48	48		301								Chrome	There are more wounded in Wanshi's platoon. He would've been too occupied with them to fight.	2

58	58		301								Chrome	About that, we did talk to Camu when we received the notice.	2																					
59	59		301								Chrome	Even if the Omega Weapon is really capable of that, he has no wish to change who he is right now. Not to mention that there are still a lot of uncertainties regarding the weapon's power.	2
