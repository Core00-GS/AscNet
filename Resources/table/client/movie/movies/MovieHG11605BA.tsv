12	12		301									It does not matter for now. You are treading on a tightrope—better keep up the unconscious act and observe quietly.																						
13	13		401							2	1516																							
14	14		301									Right then, you hear footsteps closing in, and with them a sense of hostility that further weighs down your heavy breaths.																						
15	15		201							1	500225																							
16	16		301							1	Changyu	Hey, hands off the goods! 【kuroname】 is not yours yet. How about your part of the deal?	1																					
17	17		301									Changyu's protest is followed by the sound of a connected hit, and the hostile presence stumbles away from you.

26	26		201							1	500225																							
27	27		301							1	Changyu	Reminding you of the terms of our deal. No one benefits if you violate 'em.	1																					
28	28		301								Changyu	Or maybe you do want to fight a Construct?	1																					
29	29		301								Changyu	My left wrist comes with a special little trinket today. Perhaps y'all want a demonstration?	1

32	32		301									Taking Changyu's hint, you stealthily twist your left arm under the cover of the wall, activating the beacon in your bracelet.																						
33	33		301								Serious Female Voice	Trinket? What are you talking about?																						
34	34		301									Changyu only answers with a disdainful grunt.																						
35	35		201							1	500226																							
36	36		301							1	Gravelly Male Voice	Just show him the thing.	1																					
37	37		401							2	1509																							
38	38		301									You hear the sound of a suitcase unlocking.																						
39	39		301								Gravelly Male Voice	Take a look.	1																					
40	40		301									Changyu takes a few steps and stops nearby.																						
41	41		201							1	500225	1																						
42	42		301							1	Changyu	Yep, looks good. This device'll help us sort out the knockoffs.	1

44	44		301								Calm Female Voice	If everyone's happy with their merchandise, let's move on and pay your... "deposits."																						
45	45		301								Calm Female Voice	Once we've sealed our deal, Akdilek will remove our enemies for us; in exchange, we will no longer adulterate your products. Perhaps that's enough to salvage your name, or whatever's left of it.																						
46	46		302								(I see...)	47	(So that's what Changyu's after...)	47																				
47	47		301								Calm Female Voice	However, in the event of a breach of contract...																						
48	48		201							1	500225	13

52	52		301									Changyu sneers in the far corner of the room. He turns around, the sound of his footsteps heading toward you.																						
53	53		302								(Carefully open your eyes)																							
54	54		301									In your hazy vision, you can see Changyu approaching and flexing his wrists. He, however, is brimming with satisfaction, without a trace of his mocking sneer.																						
55	55		201							1	500225	1																						
56	56		301							1	Changyu	Hey, you awake?	1																					
57	57		302								What's going on?	58	...Didn't you already know?	59																				
58	58	61	301								Changyu	I'm really sorry. I promise I'll make it up to you in a sec.	1																					
59	59		301								Changyu	Yeah... Truth is, I don't think I can handle this by myself.	1																					
60	60		204							1																								
61	61		301									Quiet as you two may be, you have alerted the others in the room.

63	63		301							1	Gravelly Male Voice	That piece of trash's awake?	1

65	65		301							1	Changyu	I'll explain later. Prepare to bolt—	1																					
66	66		301									Before he can finish, the female guard leaps onto Changyu with her weapon in hand, only to receive a kick from him square in the stomach that sends her flying.																						
67	67		201							1	500226																							
68	68		301							1	Gravelly Male Voice	You dare?! Everyone, charge! Kill the Babylonian first, we'll settle the boy's debt later!	1

75	6450		401							2	1512																							
76	75		301									Changyu dodges the attacks coming from the front, and he sends the attackers reeling on the floor with a well-placed uppercut. A dash—and he is right next to the suitcase he is after. He picks it up and throws it backward.																						
77	76		302								(Catch the suitcase)	77																						
78	77		201							1	500225	1																						
79	78		301							1	Changyu	Nice catch! Now GO!	1																					
80	79		401							2	1502																							
81	80		301									Seeing his human followers are no match to a Construct, the leader sounds the alarm, and the place is immediately swarmed with mechanoid guards.

87	86		301									Out of nowhere, a flurry of blades tear apart the front door, alongside the mechanoid guards that were flooding in—and as the dust settles, there stand the three members of Gray Raven.																						
88	87		201							1	500166																							
89	88		301							1	Lucia	Commandant! Are you alright?!	1

96	95		301							1	Changyu	Oh shut it, just run!	1																					
97	96		201							1	500226																							
98	97		301							1	Gravelly Male Voice	Stop! Do you have any idea what you're doing?! Do you understand what this transgression would cost Akdilek?!	1																					
99	98		201							1	500225	1																						
100	99		301							1	Changyu	Oh, I'm afraid you're the one in the dark. When was the last time you heard from your guy?	1																					
101	100		201							1	500226																							
102	101		301							1	Gravelly Male Voice	Enough with your bullshit! I've just heard from him!	1																					
103	102		201							1	500225	1																						
104	103		301							1	Changyu	You mean you've heard this?	1																					
105	104		301									Changyu takes out a small cubic apparatus from his pocket, and with a tap comes a familiar voice.																						
106	105		301									"All is good, bossman. No need to worry."																						
107	106		204							1																								
108	107		301								Changyu	He kept following me around, so I decided to record everything he said... The trick is to hide the cuts with some static, y'know? As for the trash you placed on our train... I haven't heard from them, have ya?	1																					
109	108		302								That's what you meant by "cleaning"?	110																						
110	109		204							1	2																							
111	110		301								Changyu	That's right, with the time you bought me.	1

118	117		301							1		At the sound of his howl, all the mechanoid guards burst in the house through the broken door, the smashed windows, even the torn down air ducts—and surround the group in a swirl of chaos.	1	2	3

123	122		202							1					1																			
124	123		301									The incoming mechanoid guards keep shoving each other into the confined space, causing more and more mayhem.																						
125	124		301									Fortunately, each fallen mechanoid guard becomes another brick of a metal wall that shields you. Unfortunately, the more they fall, the more your escape route is clogged.																						
126	125		301									You cannot reach the three Gray Ravens at the door, and you are getting further away from Changyu, as the two of you are slowly forced to the two sides of the room.																						
127	126		201							1	500225	3																						
128	127		301							1	Changyu	Hey, shouldn't we be retreating?	1																					
129	128		302								The best-laid plans go astray.	129	Hey, dream, meet reality.	129																				
130	129		301									Taking a step away from this metal wall of fallen machines means an open season for the rest of them.																						
131	130		302								Humans are kind of fragile!	131	I'm not a Construct!	131																				
132	131		301									Changyu lets out a sigh. The fight is straining on him, but he manages to turn around; with his punches leading the way, he moves toward you, one mechanoid at a time.																						
133	132		301									Suddenly, the faint sound of a ticking clock catches his attention.

137	136		301									Changyu's moves become frantic, his fists swinging wildly—but none of it matters, as he still fails to breach the walls of mechanoids and fallen machines.																						
138	137		301								Changyu	—GET OUT OF MY WAY!!!	1																					
139	138		202							1					1																			
140	139		301			RImgBg1Shake						Changyu's cry rings with a thunderous quake, shattering a wall nearby and the mechanoid guards in his way—but then—

145	144		301									A blinding white light coats your vision; a deafening buzz pierces your eardrums. You are deprived of your senses—and yet, amid this pulsating chaos, a voice, almost heartbreaking in its desperation, reaches you.
