7	7		301								???	Cheers to yet another success of yours?																						
8	8		301									The speaker sitting in front of the robot raises his glass, his figure hidden out of sight in the shadows. The liquid in the glass reflects the light and glitters gold.

10	10		301							1	"421"	Stop digressing. Where is the thing?	1																					
11	11		202							1					1																			
12	12		301								???	I don't have it yet. The authority to use Kurono's army isn't something you can get whenever you want it.																						
13	13		201							1	500162																							
14	14		301							1	"421"	I don't need the entire army. All I need is enough weapons to ensure one single person's safety.	1

23	23		301							1	"421"	Deal, then.	1

25	25		301								???	Wasting no time. I like that.																						
26	26		201							1	500162																							
27	27		301							1	"421"	Don't forget about how I want those weapons.	1

29	29		301								???	I understand.																						
30	30		301								???	Private, efficient, safe.																						
31	31		301								???	They'll complete any mission without catching anyone's attention.																						
32	32		201							1	500162																							
33	33		301							1	"421"	Well, I sure hope so.	1

35	35		301									The little robot cuts off the communication following a buzz. The speaker sitting in the shadows stands up from the red sofa and empties his glass of wine.
