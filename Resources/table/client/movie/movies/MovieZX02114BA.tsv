6	6		301			DialogEnable						The recording is over.																						
7	7		301									All the questions you have on the way here have been answered.																						
8	8		301									There was no evacuation, no bodies. Everyone stayed until the last possible moment. This brain above the Atlantic Ocean did not stop thinking until the end.																						
9	9		301									Except all the fuel was consumed, with barely any cinder remaining.																						
10	10		301									But the last spark is safely kept at the top of this light house.																						
11	11		301									Vera steps back.																						
12	12		201							1	500345	13																						
13	13		301							1	Vera	This is insane...	1																					
14	14		301									Despite her murmur, she grins like a mad woman.																						
15	15		301								Vera	Ha! These people were out of their minds like me. Absolutely unhinged.	1																					
16	16		302								Vera?	17																						
17	17		301								Vera	You were right. They didn't take what they went through as a lesson.	1																					
18	18		301								Vera	They could have a second chance and nothing would change.	1																					
19	19		202							1					1																			
20	20		301									They only treated it as a failed experiment.																						
21	21		301									Experiment. Fail. Experiment again, and fail again. This was but their daily lives.																						
22	22		301									Vera wipes away the tears at the corner of her eye.																						
23	23		301									She suddenly remembers why she was recruited by Nikola in the first place.																						
24	24		301									Kill. Survive. Kill again, and survive again. That was the whole of her existence.																						
25	25		301									She was always the one who remains, carrying everyone's pain. She could not tell what could possibly await her at the finish line of this endless cycle.																						
26	26		301									So that man showed up and offered her a way out.																						
27	27		301									He told her it would be a path filled with obstacles and pain, but he promised there would be light at the end of the road.																						
28	28		201							1	500345	8																						
29	29		301							1	Vera	I see.	1																					
30	30		301									Vera closes her eyes and mutters a few words that only she can hear.																						
31	31		204							1																								
32	32		301									Then she turns to look at you.																						
33	33		301								Vera	Do you remember what I asked you?	1																					
34	34		302								About the torch?	35																						
35	35		301								Vera	Yeah.	1																					
36	36		301								Vera	I wouldn't put it out.	1																					
37	37		301								Vera	I wouldn't, because I want to find out what is there at the end of the darkness.	1																					
38	38		301								Vera	I want to find the person who planted the detonating cord and kick their ass.	1																					
39	39		202							1					1																			
40	40		301									—Don't lose the courage to go further just because we are being plundered.																						
41	41		301				DialogDisable					—Seize it, conquer it, fall, and stand again. Keep going.																						
42	42		302								Then we're just like them.	43																						
43	43		302								So are the President and the others.	44																						
44	44		302								That's why we're standing here now.	45																						
45	45		301			DialogEnable						The story of humanity is the story of the fight against fear and the unknown.																						
46	46		301									At first, humans were afraid of beasts. Then they feared fire, and the gods after that... But they have driven away the beasts, harnessed the flame, and discovered secrets withheld by gods with science.																						
47	47		301									Everyone is afraid of punishment and death, but no one has ever stopped because of them.																						
48	48		301									If they have, humans would have believed the earth to be the center of the universe. They would have thought fire and lightning were the gods' wrath. They would have hidden in the trees from the predators.																						
49	49		301									Newton said humans were playing on the seashore next to the ocean of truth. Or perhaps we are standing in the dark, fearing the unknown in the dark. But we raise our torch higher every time. Because we are curious.																						
50	50		301									That is the purest, the most primal kind of courage, the greatest gift our two million years' worth of evolution has given us.																						
51	51		301									There lies the mountain, thus our will to climb it triumphs over our fear of falling.																						
52	52		301									We would choose the same even if we could do it all over again.																						
53	53		201							1	500345	2																						
54	54		301							1	Vera	You're out of your mind too, you know?	1																					
55	55		302								Takes one to know one.	56																						
56	56		202							1					1																			
57	57		401							2	772																							
58	58		301									A sudden "Crack!" interrupts your conversation.																						
59	59		301									You look toward the sound and find the glass wall breaking, but the crack has yet to go through.																						
60	60		302								The water pressure is too high.	61																						
61	61		201							1	500345	4																						
62	62		301							1	Vera	We have to find a way to stop it.	1																					
63	63		302								Lamia.	64	But the central control system...	65																				
64	64	69	301								Vera	Right, the goddamn fish. I don't know why she can control the system, but she's the one with the clearance.	1																					
65	65		204							1	5																							
66	66		301								Vera	Of course I know you can't access it!	1																					
67	67		204							1	4																							
68	68		301								Vera	But the goddamn fish can, even if we don't know why.	1																					
69	69		301								Vera	We'll just grab her and take her here, and we force her to—	1																					
70	70		301								Vera	If the Ascendants are also after information on the zero-point energy, then there's only one place she'll be heading.	1																					
71	71		302								The top of the tower.	72																						
72	72		301								Vera	The top of the tower.	1																					
73	73		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The two of you almost say it at the same time.

77	77		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The floor below you keeps shaking. As water pours into the lower levels of Atlantis, the breeze blowing from your back also gets stronger, like the last breath of a drowning man.																						
78	78		301									You look down from the edge of the street, and there is but darkness and a trembling rumble.																						
79	79		401							2	1501																							
80	80		301									The alarm goes off—not for the breaching water, but for you, the invaders.																						
81	81		201							1	500345	5																						
82	82		301							1	Vera	Dammit! What quarrel does this place have with us?	1																					
83	83		301								Vera	Why can that Ascendant travel uninterrupted? Why does the city accept her identification?	1																					
84	84		302								Break it.	85	We're out of time.	85																				
85	85		301								Vera	I know!	1

91	91		401							2	631																							
92	92		301									The sound of Vera's spear hitting the metal echoes every time, long and petrifying. It travels downward, intensified by the empty expanse between the walls and the water, making it more haunting.																						
93	93		401						500	2	1501																							
94	94		401							2	1501																							
95	95		301									Annoyingly, every time you breach a door, you find more alarms, sealed entrances, gates, and checkpoints waiting for you.																						
96	96		301									The machine that is this city does not falter, despite its administrators gone.																						
97	97		301									Except it considers Lamia as an ally, and you two the enemy.																						
98	98		401							2	778																							
99	99		301									Water follows you closely from behind. Every time you put some distance between you, you find the road stopping before you. By the time you open a passage, the water once again closes in.																						
100	100		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					The Corrupted Lamia has brought here are amassing. They were only wandering outside in the beginning, but now they have followed the water and blocked your way to the top.
