26	26		301								Task Force	I am the leader of task force "Dodo"—don't ask about the name. None of your concern.	1

31	31		301									You can read about the situation at Southwood Road in the file. If I have to describe it... due to certain necessities of the post-pandemic generation, the place is not exactly abandoned.

33	33		301								Task Force	Didn't even read the file, huh?	1																					
34	34		301								Task Force	This section was shared by two major East Asian cities—that is to say, before the pandemic, it was pretty much no man's land.	1																					
35	35		301								Task Force	When the pandemic happened, the two major cities exiled the incurable humans and possibly infected mechanoids to this area.	1																					
36	36		301								Task Force	As you know, "humane treatment" is usually reserved only for humans.	1																					
37	37		301								Task Force	Still, what they called "humane treatment" was simply to offer the incurable humans rations and ammunition enough to last them four lifetimes.	1																					
38	38		301								Task Force	Back then, "Arcadia" had priority over everything.	1
