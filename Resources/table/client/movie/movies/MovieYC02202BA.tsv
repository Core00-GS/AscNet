6	6		304							But Roland shows no concern for this at first, unable to understand the Ascnet's favor toward him.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory448.jpg		1																			
7	7		304							Perhaps this is the privilege of humans who share the same origin as Miss Luna. They are different from me. They don't need to be pieced together.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory448.jpg		1																			
8	8		304							Therefore, I cannot understand the real greatness of Ascnet.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory448.jpg		1

11	11		304							But his meaning is hard to decipher. The defective Construct looks nothing like a flower. Similarly, I have been unable to understand his behavior.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory448.jpg		1																			
12	12		304							He obviously has the power to destroy his prey, yet he spends the time to set traps.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory448.jpg		1

16	16		304							After reaching this conclusion, I detected a mood fluctuation similar to "disappointment" in my memory circuit.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory448.jpg		1																			
17	17		304							No one seems to pay any mind to this earth-shattering power, but I am sure that this power is the gospel brought to me by the Ascnet.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory448.jpg		1

21	21		301									He'll never forget how those creatures came out from the slimy eggs.																						
22	22		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					They were squirming and twisting and looked absolutely disgusting.

26	26		301									Gabriel raises his cane and points it at the Hetero-Creature.																						
27	27		301									The back of the Hetero-Creature bulges with pus and then from it breaks transparent wings. Its insect-like wings are slowly stretching out.

36	36		301									Lazily leaning up against a wall in the corner, Roland speaks in a relaxed voice as if it is just a casual inquiry in his spare time.																						
37	37		301									He's still watching the scene closely from within the darkness.																						
38	38		301									Gabriel seems to be accustomed to Roland's indolent attitude. He doesn't even turn his head to look back.																						
39	39		201							1	500101																							
40	40		301							1	Gabriel	I need the most powerful servant as possible at my disposal. So I'm testing trial after trial.	1																					
41	41		301								Gabriel	As long as they understand that we are superior as Ascendants, then we can easily bend them to our will.	1

43	43		301								Roland	...I've been wondering if these things have feelings or thoughts. They look pretty dumb.	1																					
44	44		201							1	500101																							
45	45		301							1	Gabriel	They have no use for those.	1																					
46	46		301								Gabriel	An experienced beast only fixates on its prey. Lock, and then attack.	1																					
47	47		301								Gabriel	They are merely tools at my disposal to achieve the long cherished dream of Ascnet. Whether it is emotion or cognition, they will only become obstacles for me to control them.	1																					
48	48		301									The dark Mechanoid is gazing into the deep, bottomless tide of red, with a crazy red glint in his eyes.																						
49	49		301									Everything Gabriel pursues is in that deep pool, devouring all the "nourishment" he prepares and constantly searching for whatever he deems "most powerful" .																						
50	50		201							1	500008																							
51	51		301							1	Roland	It's strange... I remember you weren't like this before.	1

55	55		301							1	Roland	Relax. I'm almost ready. They didn't notice.	1

58	58		301							1	Gabriel	...So am I.	1																					
59	59		301								Gabriel	I have explored all possible variables that will affect the power of these creatures. All I need to do now is wait for them to evolve and reach their full potential.	1

66	66		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Gabriel has been searching in the deep pool for the strongest power as he understands. What is now presented to Roland is likely to be the answer to that power.																						
67	67		301									The indescribably massive incubator for integrating mechanoid and biological structures is suspended deep underground. Countless tubes flowing with red liquid are connected to it.

70	70		301							1	Roland	...Babylonia would never have expected this kind of thing to be hidden under the Central Purification Filter that was once the lifeline of the human race. Quite the bold decision.	1																					
71	71		301								Vonnegut	I wasn't the one to decide on the position of "Mother". The seed merely landed here and successfully germinated.	2																					
72	72		301									Vonnegut looks up at "Mother", which rises and falls with its regular "breathing". He feels reassured.																						
73	73		301								Vonnegut	This is even better than the "test subject".	2																					
74	74		301								Vonnegut	This CPF was used by humans to reduce the concentration of the Punishing Virus. But due to the existence of "Mother", it has turned into a hotbed for it to absorb nutrients.	2																					
75	75		301								Vonnegut	In the absence of the Red Tide, this is a place more suitable for "Mother" than that "greenhouse." Unfortunately, Gabriel faltered on his way to uncovering the truth.	2																					
76	76		301								Vonnegut	Perhaps, he was 99% of the way to achieving his goal, but it was the 1% he ignored that is key to achieving it. I found this in the Gabriel memory data collected by Cinderelik.	2																					
77	77		301									Speaking with a solemn tone, Vonnegut takes out an old storage device from his pocket.																						
78	78		301								Vonnegut	Gabriel thinks that emotion is useless, but he deliberately ignored what the turning point was for him becoming an Ascendant.	2																					
79	79		301								Vonnegut	Hatred, pain, obsession... These feelings are very familiar to every Ascendant, but they are completely unfamiliar to Hetero-Creatures.	2																					
80	80		301									Standing in front of "Mother", Vonnegut opens his hands as he explains his theory without hesitation.																						
81	81		301								Vonnegut	The Hetero-Creatures incubated by Gabriel have given us new possibilities and may have even inspired the Punishing Virus to develop toward intelligent lifeforms.	2																					
82	82		301								Vonnegut	However, the newly created Hetero-Creatures cannot feel emotions innate in humans, which means that they lack the primary conditions to pass the "filtering" process.	2																					
83	83		301								Vonnegut	What we need is not a beast with shackles, but a companion who can walk side by side with us in the new world.	2																					
84	84		204							1	2																							
85	85		301								Roland	Did you call me here just to show off your new pet?	1																					
86	86		301								Vonnegut	No, of course not.	2

90	90		301									Vonnegut turns around with a smile and looks at "Mother" behind him...																						
91	91		301								Vonnegut	This is the deal between us—our next step.	2																					
92	92		301								Vonnegut	It's an experiment driven by human instinct, shifting against emotions, and producing results from suffering.	2

98	98		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Roland	Vonnegut... Unbelievable. I can never tell what's on his mind.	1																					
99	99		301								Roland	To let something come into being that he's not sure if he can control... Is that what he really wants? Didn't he learn any lessons from Gabriel?	1																					
100	100		301									It's a gamble with no clear outcome ahead, a game that will only show the result when the box is open. Whether it's confidence or conceit lies in the ability of the one in control. At least for the moment, Vonnegut looks confident instead of conceited.																						
101	101		301									This "experiment", which gives Roland mixed feelings, seems to confirm what Vonnegut thinks.																						
102	102		301								Roland	So far, 14 groups of Scavengers have joined this "experiment."	1																					
103	103		202							1					1																			
104	104		301									Each batch of humans introduced into the CPF to come into contact with "Mother" has caused substantial stimulation to her body. This causes the "creatures," for lack of a better word, within it to mutate.																						
105	105		301									Roland can't find the words to describe the scene before him. Hetero-Creatures and Hetero-Plants show consistent variations at regular intervals, as if something is artificially controlling their boundaries.																						
106	106		301									Simultaneously, "Mother" has become increasingly active as if the unknown "creatures" within the incubator are beginning to achieve memory within the sea of chaos. They even seem to unconsciously respond to external stimuli.																						
107	107		301									Just like the subconscious movements of a baby in the womb, this is something even more terrifying to him than the Hetero-Creatures in Gabriel's deep pool.																						
108	108		301									As for the "experiment"...

114	114		301								Vonnegut	"Mother" is hatching, and as it matures, the abnormalities in the tower will soon spill over to the outside.	1																					
115	115		301								Vonnegut	I can wait for the birth of a new life in "Mother", but sooner or later, those in Babylonia will be able to sniff out where "Mother" is.	1																					
116	116		301								Vonnegut	So when the time is ripe, you, as an outsider, will step in and make sure "Mother" can hatch successfully.	1
