4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Liv	Lee said you wanted to talk to me about what's been going on, Commandant?	1																					
5	5		301								Liv	What exactly do you mean? I hope we can settle it during this break before I return to work on the documents.	1																					
6	6		302								Liv, you've been acting like someone else.	7	N-nothing...	8																				
7	7		301								Liv	Someone else? Do you mean my appearance?	1																					
8	8		301								Liv	Commandant, suppressing your problems will only allow them to fester and create more troubles in the future.	1																					
9	9		301								Liv	Am I sensing concerns about how my personality has changed?	1																					
10	10		301								Liv	I understand that you will worry about my attitude and approach, Commandant.	1																					
11	11		301								Liv	Let's put it this way. I haven't become someone else. I've merely adapted to suit our situation better.	1																					
12	12		302								What situation?	13	I think I prefer the old you.	14																				
13	13	15	301								Liv	Combat, support, exploration, work. Everything.	1																					
14	14		301								Liv	Nothing would be done if I kept going on like that...	1																					
15	15		301								Liv	Anyway, I should go back to taking care of the dormitory and the document from Babylonia.	1																					
16	16		302								Isn't that my job?	17	You're helping me on those too, Liv?	18																				
17	17	19	301								Liv	We don't have to bother you with this kind of trivial work, Commandant. I'll take care of the documents.	1																					
18	18		301								Liv	Of course. I don't think you'll have time to worry about them when you have the crucial job of commanding, Commandant.	1																					
19	19		301								Liv	Commandant, I hope you aren't asking for those jobs back.	1																					
20	20		301								Liv	This is something I want to do. And I'll finish what I started properly.	1																					
21	21		301								Liv	Please trust me.	1																					
22	22		302								...Don't overexert yourself.	23	I see.	24																				
23	23		301								Liv	I'll pay attention to it.	1																					
24	24		301								Liv	Then please disconnect and rest up, Commandant. It's getting late.	1																					
25	25		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	I should return to my work.	1
