20	20		301									However, there are also multiple obstructions interfering with the signals within the detector's range. There is no way to pinpoint the location of a specific target.																						
21	21		301									Chiko nods and continues asking.																						
22	22		301								Chiko	How's the hacking on the surveillance authorization going?	1

31	31		204							1																								
32	32		301									Almost every member of the Purifying Force is used to working alone. There has never been an operation that requires a team of more than five ever since the Purifying Force was formed.																						
33	33		301									Not to mention that the Purifying Force has enlisted many members from other squads, as well as new recruits fresh out of school, leading to the current situation.																						
34	34		301								???	I'm sorry. Were you asking for me, Vice-Captain?																						
35	35		301									Chiko takes a deep breath and calms herself, asking the same question the third time.																						
36	36		204							1	4																							
37	37		301								Chiko	Have we gotten access to the cameras?	1

40	40		301									A brief commotion of panic comes from the back. A young Construct is staring at the terminal, his fingers flying all over the keyboard.																						
41	41		301									His name is printed on the custom terminal—Delapoer.																						
42	42		301								Delapoer	The security system here isn't using the popular encryption method from the Golden Age. It's a bit difficult to crack it from the outside...	1																					
43	43		301								Delapoer	But if you can give me another 15 minutes... no, 10 minutes...	1																					
44	44		201							1	500498	14																						
45	45		301							1		Looking at the corpses on the floor and her injured teammate, Chiko contemplates for a moment.																						
46	46		204							1	4																							
47	47		301								Chiko	That's longer than we can afford. We've encountered five Corrupted attacks already. Who can say when the next one's coming?	1																					
48	48		301								Chiko	How long will it take if we hack it from an access point within the administrative room?	1																					
49	49		201							1	500028																							
50	50		301							1	Delapoer	Copy that, Vice-Captain... If I have access to the administrative room, I can transfer the virus directly to reset the system authorization.	1																					
51	51		201							1	500498	4																						
52	52		301							1	Chiko	I'm adjusting our objective. Prioritize making our way to the administrative room and access to the cameras.	1																					
53	53		301								Chiko	And stop saying "copy that" before every sentence, rookie. We don't need your habits from boot camp in the field.	1

57	57		301							1	Construct A	But our mission here is to search for the Red-Tide-worshipping cult "Scarlet Revelation" that got tricked here by the Ascendants. The higher-ups won't be happy if we get sidetracked and get them killed.	1																					
58	58		201							1	500498	4																						
59	59		301							1	Chiko	If they were indeed tricked here by the Ascendants as the intel said, they could be monitoring us right now.	1

77	77		301							1	Norris	And what's wrong with you today? You can usually hack into small cameras like this just with your toes! Are you getting stage fright joining a big operation for the first time?	2																					
78	78		301							1	Norris	Or is the customized terminal I gave you not to your liking? I remember that you used to need the same pillow or you couldn't sleep well. Aren't you still using Sleeping Pod 3? Does it apply to terminals as well?	2																					
79	79		301							1	Delapoer	My toes... Stop exaggerating...	1																					
80	80		301							1		Delapoer shakes his head, bombarded by his terrible friend's endless questions.																						
81	81		301							1	Delapoer	The terminal is great. Like I said, the encryption here is uncommon.	1																					
82	82		301							1		Delapoer looks confused as he says that.																						
83	83		301							1	Delapoer	But most assets Copperfield left on the surface use the same encryption method. This is the first time I've seen something like this.	1																					
84	84		301							1	Norris	Maybe the guy was getting creative that day... or perhaps the Ascendants altered the encryption, haha...	2																					
85	85		301							1		Delapoer shivers, quickly covering Norris' mouth.																						
86	86		301							1	Delapoer	Knock on wood! I don't want to see any Ascendants today!	1																					
87	87		301							1	Norris	You're part of the Purifying Force now. Sooner or later you'll run into them.	2																					
88	88		301							1		Norris easily removes his hold and rests a hand on his shoulder instead, speaking to him earnestly.																						
89	89		301							1	Norris	This is part of growing up, you know?	2																					
90	90		301							1	Delapoer	You talk like you had met an Ascendant before...	1																					
91	91		301							1		Delapoer knows the person before him. Had Norris survived an encounter with an Ascendant with an intact speech module, Delapoer would have had to disable his own audio module, or he would never have heard the end of it.																						
92	92		301							1	Norris	Haha! Even though a new Ascendant pops up every other day, and many of them showed up during the Kowloong War, I still haven't met one! I'm kind of lucky, I guess.	2

100	100		301								Norris	Don't you worry even if we run into Ascendants. You specialists are rare in the Purifying Force.	1																					
101	101		301								Norris	You'll be safe with us in the front.	1																					
102	102		301								Norris	And Vice-Captain is with us, too. Not the best reputation, sure, but her skills on the battlefield are unmatched.	1

128	128		301									Out of nowhere, Delapoer suddenly wonders if the fish in there consider the humans some aliens trapped in their own glass cages.																						
129	129		301									The members of "Scarlet Revelation" believe the dead are reborn in the Red Ttide. Since it retains their memories, data, and consciousness, the Red Tide Projections are considered echoes of their lives.

247	247		301							1	Hassen	Thank you for your hard work on the last mission.	1																					
248	248		301				DialogDisable				Hassen	You mentioned in your report that Lithos has some unique insights on the Red Tide?	1																					
249	249		302								He seems to believe that the lives taken by the Red Tide aren't completely gone.	250																						
250	250		302								They merely live on in another fractured form.	251																						
251	251		301			DialogEnable					Hassen	Hmm. This seems to match what Noan said...	1																					
252	252		301								Hassen	I suspect that the incident at Copperfield Aquarium is the work of the Ascendants.	1																					
253	253		302								Copperfield Aquarium?	254																						
254	254		301								Hassen	You heard me. That's where you're going next.	1																					
255	255		301								Hassen	The truth is, the Ascendants aren't just targeting Constructs with their rumors... They have also swayed some Scavengers groups that hold similar ideals.	1

259	259		302								"Scarlet Revelation"?	260																						
260	260		301								Hassen	It is a new group that believes the Red Tide can resurrect the dead.	1																					
261	261		301								Hassen	From the testimonials we gathered, they were a small group of 13 before gradually expanding into a group of thousands.	1																					
262	262		301								Hassen	The original 13 that started the group call themselves the "13 Revelationists".	1																					
263	263		302								...	264																						
264	264		301								Hassen	They haven't done anything as fanatical as pushing or luring people into the Red Tide yet.	1																					
265	265		301								Hassen	But, recently, the 13 Revealationists all received invitations from an unknown Ascendant one after another.	1																					
266	266		301								Hassen	The Ascendant promised them rebirth through the Red Tide if they showed up at a specific location and passed the Ascendant's test and filtering.	1																					
267	267		301								Hassen	Even though the 13 only considered "Rebirth through the Red Tide" a tale of solace, any comfort they could find turned into a lifeline in these desperate times.	1																					
268	268		301								Hassen	Most of them died on their journey. The Purifying Force only found dead bodies and a handful of survivors when they arrived.	1																					
269	269		301								Hassen	Only 1 of the 13 Revealationists survived.	1

276	276		301							1	Hassen	Grace last appeared in Copperfield Aquarium.	1																					
277	277		302								Were the Ascendants trying to turn the people into one of them?																							
278	278		301									Noan mentioned that it was not humans but Lithos who turned him into a Construct. You do not know how or why, but the Ascendants also seem to possess Construct technology.																						
279	279		301								Hassen	Not really. Their situations were different from Noan's.	1																					
280	280		301								Hassen	They all tested negative for Tantalum-193 affinity in conservation areas in the past. There was no way they could become Constructs.	1																					
281	281		301								Hassen	And we've found that the technology used on Noan's frame was more or less identical to ours apart from the anomaly in his M.I.N.D.	1																					
282	282		301								Hassen	In theory, even the Ascendants couldn't turn them into Constructs.	1																					
283	283		301								Hassen	Nonetheless, we couldn't just watch as our own were sacrificed for some Ascendant conspiracies.	1																					
284	284		301								Hassen	We sent a team of Purifying Force to investigate the aquarium, but they also disappeared.	1																					
285	285		302								Even Chiko?	286

297	297		302								Understood.	298

302	302		301									There are so many questions you want answers to that you have no idea where to begin. However, Hassen seems to know what you want to ask just at the mention of Lee.																						
303	303		301								Hassen	I understand your worry, but I can't tell you too much yet.	1																					
304	304		301								Hassen	But I want you to know that we're doing what we're doing to prevent another "Empyrea".	1

320	320		301									You are not surprised to find her as the captain of the squad. You are surprised to find her using a frame you have never seen instead of the Veritas frame while the Zero frame is under repair. Even her bow has been replaced with a Swordstaff.																						
321	321		301								Bianca	Our mission takes place indoors this time. Since a bow isn't the most optimal weapon of choice, I've been provided with alternative equipment.	1																					
322	322		301									Noticing the confusion in your eyes, she explains the reason why she has changed her weapon.																						
323	323		301								Bianca	By the way, Vesalius asked me to give this to you.	1																					
324	324		301				DialogDisable					Bianca hands you a familiar-looking connection device.																						
325	325		302								Is this the improved Deep M.I.N.D. connection device?	326

330	330		302			AniZhuanchangEnd					"Phantom Tracer"?	331																						
331	331		301			DialogEnable					Bianca	That's right. It's the new technology at the core of the Stigmata frame.	1																					
332	332		301									According to Bianca, the lamp-shaped "Phantom Tracer" can help her reconstruct the past in a set area.																						
333	333		301									The "Spear of F.O.S." that Gray Raven used could do the same as long as there are functional digital devices on the scene if this is all the tracer is for.																						
334	334		301									But...																						
335	335		301								Bianca	Unlike the Spear of F.O.S., the Phantom Tracer can read part of the data stored within the Punishing Virus before deciphering it with an enhanced version of the Spear of F.O.S.	1																					
336	336		301								Bianca	Limited by the Construct hardware, we cannot perform the same kind of analysis and simulation as a dedicated machine. A machine like that, however, is easily infected by the Punishing Virus, which limits its mobility.	1																					
337	337		301								Bianca	The Spear of F.O.S. Asimov invented can be used by Constructs, but it only works on the data stored inside functional digital devices.	1																					
338	338		301								Bianca	The "Phantom Tracer" fills the gap between them. Given how the surface is filled with the Punishing Virus, we can use this tracer to figure out what happened to an area in the past.	1																					
339	339		201							1	500166	5																						
340	340		301							1	Lucia	So the Punishing Virus is capable of storing data... Now that I think about it, the Red Tide Projections have proven to show similar traits.	1																					
341	341		201							1	500533																							
342	342		301							1	Bianca	According to the researchers, they have been investigating this property of the Punishing Virus for a long time, dating back to before even the Red Tide was first discovered.	1																					
343	343		301								Bianca	But it wasn't until Noan's recent appearance that gave them the final piece of the puzzle.	1																					
344	344		302								Using the Phantom Tracer will lead to M.I.N.D. deviation?	345																						
345	345		301									Although you do not understand how the Phantom Tracer works, it is clear to you that deciphering information from the Punishing Virus is not as easy as clicking open a document from a terminal.																						
346	346		301								Bianca	Yes. If a Deep M.I.N.D. connection isn't established after running the tracer for a certain amount of time, it can lead to permanent damage and deviation to the M.I.N.D.	1																					
347	347		301								Bianca	And given that the deciphering process involves the Punishing Virus, establishing a Deep M.I.N.D. connection while the tracer is running exacts a heavier toll on the commandant than usual.	1																					
348	348		302								How long do we have?	349																						
349	349		204							1	5																							
350	350		301								Bianca	...We don't know yet.	1																					
351	351		302								You don't know? Hold on...	352																						
352	352		302								Bianca, has Stigmata been calibrated and tested in simulations?	353																						
353	353		301									Noan only arrived on Babylonia a while ago. If the researchers were only able to complete the Phantom Tracer after Noan's appearance, then Stigmata must not have been made for long.																						
354	354		204							1	8																							
355	355		301								Bianca	...	1																					
356	356		204							1	5																							
357	357		301								Bianca	Given how urgent the situation is, this frame has only been briefly tested and calibrated. But we're certain that it won't damage my M.I.N.D. when we're not using the Phantom Tracer.	1																					
358	358		301				DialogDisable				Bianca	As for the tracer itself... There wasn't a suitable testing venue on Babylonia, and it was too late to test it on the ground.	1
