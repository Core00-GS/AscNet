9	9		301			DialogEnable						Ten minutes ago, the Travelling Wizard was made speechless when he saw the crates full of bamboo leaves.																						
10	10		201							1	500410																							
11	11		301							1		To ship the materials back, he borrowed the largest boat in the village from the fisherman. Still, he underestimated Gray Raven's ability.																						
12	12		301								Travelling Wizard	Did you take all the bamboo leaves from the mountain...?	1

14	14		201							2	1031001		-400																					
15	15		301							1	Liv	Sorry, Wizard. I forgot the boat had limited space.	2																					
16	16		301								Travelling Wizard	I reserved some space for you to hide in the boat... I mean, we need to go past the ferry, and I don't think you want to be surrounded by villagers again...	1																					
17	17		301								Travelling Wizard	Tch... Actually, don't worry. I can use my alteration magic to turn you into children, so you can hide inside the crates.	1																					
18	18		301								Travelling Wizard	That also solves the problem.	1																					
19	19		301									After throwing four successful rolls, Gray Raven became Little Gray Raven.																						
20	20		301									But the Travelling Wizard never explained what the problem was.																						
21	21		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Just before the team arrived at the Travelling Wizard's temporary workshop, the villagers somehow found out where they were. Almost the entire village rushed to see their heroes.

25	25		301			DialogEnable				1	Travelling Wizard	We've got all the materials ready, folks. Rest assured that the crisis will soon be resolved.	1																					
26	26		301									The Travelling Wizard holds the bamboo leaves up high, trying to convince the crowd to leave.																						
27	27		301								Travelling Wizard	What? Where are the heroes now?	1																					
28	28		301									Overwhelmed by the noisy crowd, he has to scream at the top of his lungs to answer them.																						
29	29		301								Travelling Wizard	The heroes have gone back to the mountain. If you want to thank them, just wait in the village.	1																					
30	30		301								Travelling Wizard	It's true! I swear! They are right there!	1																					
31	31		301									The Travelling Wizard points to the roof to make himself more convincing as he makes an oath.																						
32	32		301									The crowd has finally left. The Travelling Wizard collapses to the ground.

35	35		301							1	Liv	Thank you, Travelling Wizard.	2																					
36	36		301									Liv peeks out from the roof. After feeling the villagers' extreme passion and hospitality, Gray Raven dares not show up directly in front of them.																						
37	37		301								Travelling Wizard	No problem. I just didn't expect you to reject the honor without even thinking.	1																					
38	38		301								Liv	We didn't help the village for that.	2																					
39	39		301								Travelling Wizard	And that's exactly why I would like to thank you once again on behalf of the villagers.	1																					
40	40		301								Travelling Wizard	But we don't have much time left. Where are you going next, heroes?	1																					
41	41		301								Liv	Like what you said, there weren't enough materials outside the Realm of Dragons to make the replicas of the Ancient Triangle.	2																					
42	42		301								Travelling Wizard	Correct.	1																					
43	43		301								Liv	If we can solve the problem once and for all, we would love to give it a try. But we need a replica of the Ancient Triangle to enter the Realm of Dragons in the first place.	2																					
44	44		301								Liv	So we want to go to the capital and get all the three parts needed first.	2																					
45	45		301								Travelling Wizard	Great.	1																					
46	46		301								Liv	Besides, we also collected a lot of materials from the bamboo forest. Once you have taken the portion you need, we'll give the rest to other villages in need along the way. After all, the forest is too dangerous for non-combatants to enter.	2																					
47	47		301								Travelling Wizard	That's fantastic. When are you going to head out? Like, right now?	1																					
48	48		401							1	205																							
49	49		301								Lee	Hold on...																						
50	50		301								Lee	I think we need to settle our rewards first.																						
51	51		301								Travelling Wizard	...	1																					
52	52		301								Liv	We didn't help you for the sake of rewards, but if we can get what we deserve, I'm sure we can help more people in the upcoming journey.	2																					
53	53		301								Travelling Wizard	Oops, I almost forgot.	1																					
54	54		301								Lee	I saw the Mountain God give you a large bag of gold coins. We must have completed some tasks along the way.																						
55	55		301								Lee	Now I understand why the villagers forced you to make an oath.																						
56	56		301								Travelling Wizard	Oh, don't say that. I was just comforting the villagers on behalf of gods.	1

58	58		201							2	500032		-400																					
59	59		301							1	Lucia	You mean lying in the name of gods?	2																					
60	60		301								Travelling Wizard	In the name of gods, I didn't lie.	1																					
61	61		301									The Travelling Wizard holds his head up high, as if it is one of the few things he can take pride in.																						
62	62		301								Travelling Wizard	Anyway, here's the Heroes' Journal that records all the related information about the Realm of Dragons. It has been revised by many generations of heroes and can definitely be of help.	1																					
63	63		301									The Travelling Wizard holds something up high that resembles a notebook with many pieces of paper inside of different sizes. Just like what he described, its surface has been modified many times.																						
64	64		301									Liv stretches her hand as much as she could, but cannot reach the notebook with a child's body. Lucia has to hold her lower body so she can extend a little further to grab the Heroes' Journal.																						
65	65		301									The Travelling Wizard then strikes a pose to wave a silent goodbye.																						
66	66		302								Thanks for giving it to us.	67																						
67	67		302								But this is just the addendum at the bottom of the list of rewards, isn't it?	68																						
68	68		301									The Travelling Wizard crouches down as he prepares to run, pretending he didn't hear you.																						
69	69		202							1	2				1																			
70	70		302								(Immediately leap off the roof)	71																						
71	71		302								(Roll a Dexterity check)	72	(Roll a Strength check)	75																				
72	72		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	Because you have been shrunk to a child's body, the DC (difficulty class) is very high. The dexterity roll is... successful.	1																					
73	73		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	The Travelling Wizard takes a luck roll...	1																					
74	74	78	301								Dungeon Master Ayla	Alright, Commandant lands from above and pounces on the Travelling Wizard, grabbing his robe. However, he quickly unties the robe, gets away, and disappears in the bush.	1																					
75	75		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	Because you have been shrunk to a child's body, the DC (difficulty class) is very high. The strength roll is... successful.	1																					
76	76		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	The Travelling Wizard takes a luck roll...	1																					
77	77	78	301								Dungeon Master Ayla	Alright, Commandant lands from above and knocks the Travelling Wizard to the ground, but he quickly casts a spell to make himself slippery, losing the robe and disappearing in the bush.	1																					
78	78		201							1	500032																							
79	79		301							1	Lucia	Commandant, shall we catch him?	1																					
80	80		302								Of course. He ran away with our rewards.	81																						
81	81		301									The team is about to go after the wizard, but something unexpected has caught up to them.

84	84		301									Lucia tries to land but ends up falling on the grass.																						
85	85		201							1	500032																							
86	86		301							1	Lucia	Why?	1																					
87	87		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	As your bodies are shrunk to children's, you lose all attributes and any action that requires a check has their difficulty doubled before you get used to the new bodies.																						
88	88		202							1					1																			
89	89		201							1	500049																							
90	90		301							1	Liv	Let me try. Roll.	1																					
91	91		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	Rolling... Check failed. Little Liv stumbles upon her own feet, falling next to Little Lucia in the exact same way.																						
92	92		302								...	93																						
93	93		302								Lee, would you like to give it a go too?	94																						
94	94		302								I mean, there's no ladder nearby anyway.	95	Don't worry, I'll catch you from below.	95																				
95	95		301								Lee	Thanks, but no thanks.																						
96	96		301								Lee	Commandant, don't forget that you are also a child now. Such action has its risks. Ayla, I'll roll a check.																						
97	97		301									Little Lee falls backward off the roof before he even starts to jump.																						
98	98		302								(We have trusted him too soon.)	99																						
99	99		301									Maybe we are the "problem" that he mentioned earlier...																						
100	100		302								Ayla, is there any way we can dispel this magic?	101																						
101	101		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	Only those with the corresponding spell can do so. For example, a powerful wizard.																						
102	102		301								Liv	If the Heroes' Journal was passed down by previous heroes, will it contain the information they left? Surely there must be some powerful wizards among them?	1																					
103	103		301									Liv opens the notebook and soon finds a hand-drawn map.																						
104	104		301								Liv	Oh, here it is. The path to the capital... Commandant, we will go past a Nameless Sage along the way.	1																					
105	105		302								Ayla, what does the writing about this Nameless Sage look like?	106																						
106	106		301								Dungeon Master Ayla	Looks pretty new. It almost has not faded at all.																						
107	107		302								Let's go there then.	108																						
108	108		202							1																								
109	109		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					We need to transform back to our original looks first...
