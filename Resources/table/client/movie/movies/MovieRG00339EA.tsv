3	3		301			DialogEnable						When the Demon King was finally defeated, everything around us turned blurry. I felt a force grabbed me and threw me away.

5	5		301							1	Lucia	Commandant!	1																					
6	6		301									When I realized, it was all dark around me. There was a light spot in the distance. It was where we fought moments ago.																						
7	7		302								What just happened?	8	Where's everyone else?	10																				
8	8		201							1	500001																							
9	9		301							1	Goddess	Just some preparation for the ending.	1																					
10	10		201							1	500174	1																						
11	11		301							1	Liv	Don't worry, we are all fine.	1																					
12	12		201							1	500001																							
13	13		301							1	Goddess	Congratulations, heroes. You have cleared this game.	1																					
14	14		201							1	500176																							
15	15		301							1	Camu	Are you the Goddess, or the Demon King?	1																					
16	16		201							1	500001	2																						
17	17		301							1	Goddess	Of course I'm the Goddess. By the way, both the King and the Demon King are still alive.	1																					
18	18		201							1	500176																							
19	19		301							1	Camu	What? Still alive? Don't tell me we have to play one more time!	1																					
20	20		201							1	500001																							
21	21		301							1	Goddess	I said you cleared it. This run is over. Neither the King nor the Demon King could do anything anymore.	1																					
22	22		201							1	1081001	1																						
23	23		301							1	Kamui	So, is the world peaceful now?	1																					
24	24		201							1	500001																							
25	25		301							1	Goddess	Yes, the world is peaceful, until the next time it is restarted.	1																					
26	26		302								The next restart?	27	Isn't the peace forever?	28																				
27	27	29	301								Goddess	We have independent minds, but we are still a part of the game.	1																					
28	28		301								Goddess	If another hero enters the game and chooses to restart, the world will change accordingly. Another Demon King, or something else, will start wreaking havoc.	1																					
29	29		201							1	1081001	17																						
30	30		301							1	Kamui	Are you saying all our efforts are wasted?	1																					
31	31		201							1	500001																							
32	32		301							1	Goddess	But we live by such "rules." Even if we keep repeating the same cycle, we are still living in this world.	1																					
33	33		301								Goddess	Perhaps we cannot realize the changes to this world, but we are a part of the story, and we help the heroes to create the next cycle.	1																					
34	34		301								Goddess	That gives us a great sense of accomplishment.	1																					
35	35		301									The Goddess referred to everything that took place in the game as "rules." She and everyone else all lived under such rules.																						
36	36		301									And they took pride from such life... If she hated it even a little bit, she wouldn't be smiling so brilliantly.																						
37	37		201							1	500180	5																						
38	38		301							1	Karenina	But the world will plunge into chaos once again, just because a button is pressed! Can you really accept that?	1																					
39	39		201							1	500001	4																						
40	40		301							1	Goddess	Hmm, it probably will sound a bit strange, given that the Goddess is more like an "outsider" in the game.	1																					
41	41		301								Goddess	But I'll still say this.	1																					
42	42		301								Goddess	Why not?	1																					
43	43		201							1	500180	5																						
44	44		301							1	Karenina	What?	1																					
45	45		301									Karenina was shocked by the Goddess' answer. She smiled again when she saw Karenina's stunned face.																						
46	46		201							1	500001																							
47	47		301							1	Goddess	Because I believe that you will still come to save this world next time.	1																					
48	48		302								Yes, of course.	49	I can't guarantee that...	50																				
49	49	51	301								Goddess	That's a deal.	1																					
50	50		301								Goddess	Oh, I can ask other heroes then. I'm sure I will meet heroes like you again.	1																					
51	51		301								Goddess	Looks like we don't have much time left.	1																					
52	52		302								Time to say goodbye?	54																						
53	54		301								Goddess	Yeah. The game has a safety feature that automatically kicks the players out after they have played a certain amount of time, or after the game is cleared.	1																					
54	55		301									Something grabbed my body, pulling me further away.																						
55	56		301									The Goddess started talking again in the darkness.																						
56	57		301								Goddess	I have met many heroes from the outside world. One of them told me that he would get nothing in return from saving the world in the game.	1																					
57	58		301								Goddess	No one was going to praise him. The items he obtained in the game could not make him stronger in the real world.	1																					
58	59		301								Goddess	So I asked him, "Why do you still play this game so seriously?"	1																					
59	60		301								Goddess	"Because this world needs a hero. Don't you think?"	1																					
60	61		201							1	1081001	1																						
61	62		301							1	Kamui	That's so cool...	1																					
62	63		201							1	500181																							
63	64		301							1	Vera	What's cool about being a game nerd?	1																					
64	65		201							1	500173																							
65	66		301							1	Lee	This is supposed to be a touching moment... Do you really have to ruin it, Vera?	1																					
66	67		202							1																								
67	68		301									A list of credits quickly flashed across. Many of the entries were changed into Celica's own name.																						
68	69		301									We were commenting on the list, until we saw...																						
69	70		301									"I know a lot of things are still a mess... But thank you for playing this game."																						
70	71		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					That was the last line I saw before leaving the game.
