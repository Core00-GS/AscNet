4	4		301									If someone tells you to make a wish...																						
5	5		301									What would you ask for?																						
6	6		301									Strength? Money? Power?																						
7	7		301									Perhaps most people would be quiet and think it over first in order to sort through thousands of wishes and then pick the one with the highest priority.																						
8	8		301									Even though it's just a casual question, and there is no promise to make their wishes come true, humans will still waste their time putting their wishes in order just in case they were ever to meet a genie.																						
9	9		301									However, I don't think this is an act of futility. If we don't recognize what is most precious to us, how can we pursue it?																						
10	10		301									If we don't pursue our wishes, how can we confirm that we are truly alive?																						
11	11		301									As for me? Of course, I have a wish. If someone really wishes to hear it, I won't hesitate in sharing it.																						
12	12		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Well, the current situation is another matter entirely...																						
13	13		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory424.jpg																								
14	14		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Along the road, the voices of pedestrians and roadside peddlers fill the air.																						
15	15		301									The scorching sun shines overhead. The bustling crowd hustles along the avenue in search of shade.																						
16	16		301									A little farther away, a stream of cars floods the roads under the distant horizon formed by numerous skyscrapers.																						
17	17		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					These scenes that Roland was familiar with have now been replaced by a rat's nest of narrow alleyways, becoming indistinguishable in his asphyxiated mind.

22	22		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Gangster	Hmph, so what's your wish? Come on now.	1																					
23	23		301								Gangster	Spit it out. What's your dying wish?	1																					
24	24		301								Roland	Agh... Argh!	2																					
25	25		301									A hand and a gun press firmly against Roland's temples, forcing his shoulders to the ground and making it difficult for him to move his hands. Sunlight struggles to find its way into the dark and secluded alley. Pedestrians turn a blind eye. He has nowhere to escape.																						
26	26		301								Gangster	You've been meddling in our affairs for too long. Now you know everything. We weren't expecting that lousy sheriff to actually investigate us, and we certainly did not expect you to follow those orders.	1																					
27	27		301								Gangster	I heard rumors about some chump in the force trying to play hero and fight crime as some sorta lofty ideal of his. Seems like you must be his lapdog. "Knight." Hmph, that code name really suits you.	1																					
28	28		301								Gangster	Knights willing to sacrifice themselves for the king's ambitions. More like idiots with a death wish. You really think you're worthy of calling yourself a knight, eh?	1																					
29	29		301								Gangster	Looks like it's the end of the line. Alright, time to...	1																					
30	30		301								Roland	Ah! Rngh‚Äî	2

32	32		201							1	500369	4																						
33	33		301							1	Mandhasti	Hey, hey there... Compadre. Take it easy on that knight of mine.	1																					
34	34		301									While Roland is struggling on the ground, a third voice is heard in the alley. It is from a man leaning against the wall and panting‚Äîa stark contrast from the low, coarse voice of the gangster.																						
35	35		203							1	0.25	-400																						
36	36		201							2	500382		400																					
37	37		301							1	Gangster	Hmph, stand aside, Sheriff. Catch your breath and keep your mouth shut. I don't want you gettin' caught in the crossfire.	2																					
38	38		301								Gangster	Deadeye Mandhasti, I've heard about you. Any earlier, and you'da blasted me. But you wanna take a bullet for this lapdog a' yours? Hmph, playing favorites, are we?	2																					
39	39		301								Mandhasti	When a knight is in trouble, it's the king's duty to help... Cough, why are you after my knight?	1																					
40	40		301								Gangster	Hmph... Mind askin' your lapdog what he's doin' on our turf?	2																					
41	41		301								Mandhasti	Relax. He's here on my orders. We've got a problem that needs fixed, you and I. Cough, namely... keeping the city's peace.	1																					
42	42		301								Mandhasti	I can assure you that I will give you an answer that is satisfactory to both sides.	1																					
43	43		202							1	2				1																			
44	44		301									Roland hears the rustling sound of clothes behind him. He can picture Mandhasti barely propping himself up, bending down slightly, and bowing like some sort of polite young king from days of yore.																						
45	45		201							1	500369	4	-400																					
46	46		201							2	500382		400																					
47	47		301							1	Gangster	...That's what you say, Mandhasti.	2																					
48	48		301								Mandhasti	As the sheriff of this city, I cannot lie.	1																					
49	49		301								Gangster	You better be a man of your word. You've got some moxie, though. I'll give you that.	2																					
50	50		301								Gangster	But if we aren't satisfied with the results, we won't let you two off the hook next time.	2																					
51	51		202							1	2				1																			
52	52		401							2	1516																							
53	53		301									Roland feels the muzzle pressed against his forehead loosen, followed by several footsteps.																						
54	54		301									Gazing from afar, Mandhasti watches the gruff gangster leave the alley, then sits on the ground and gasps for air. Turns out his confident negotiation was all just an act.																						
55	55		201							1	500369	4																						
56	56		301							1	Mandhasti	(Cough) All taken care of... That was a close one. Glad my good deeds haven't gone unnoticed.	1																					
57	57		201							1	500365	7																						
58	58		301							1	Roland	Mandy... A-are you alright?	1																					
59	59		202							1					1																			
60	60		301									Roland rubs the back of his neck, coughs a few times, and props himself up to check on Mandhasti.																						
61	61		201							1	500369	1	-400																					
62	62		201							2	500365	7	400																					
63	63		301							1	Mandhasti	I'm okay for now. Don't worry about me first. Roland, you just (cough)...	1																					
64	64		204							2	5																							
65	65		301								Roland	No. It was nothing.	2																					
66	66		301									Looking up, Roland suddenly kneels down on one knee in the direction of Mandhasti. He bows his head, clenches a fist and clasps it to his chest in a solemn tone.																						
67	67		301								Roland	This is to complete my mission! To realize our dream!	2																					
68	68		301									He opens his other hand to reveal a small USB. Even with the gangster threatening him at gunpoint, he didn't let go.																						
69	69		301								Roland	I managed to get a hold of some important files of theirs. You said that gangs were a necessary evil for maintaining peace here, but as a knight, I couldn't just sit here and watch you constantly put yourself in harm's way!	2																					
70	70		204							1																								
71	71		301								Mandhasti	Heh... Good job, Roland. You've done a great service for keeping the peace.	1																					
72	72		301								Mandhasti	But don't do that again next time. Your life is as important to me as our dream.	1																					
73	73		301								Mandhasti	You said you were just going on patrol. But since you put on your windbreaker and brought so much stuff... Not to mention walking around uneasily like that... I assumed you were going by yourself to exchange intel with the gang. Think I don't know my own knight?	1																					
74	74		301								Mandhasti	That's why I was so worried and followed you all the way here. Hehe, it's only natural for knights to go out with their king behind them, cough...	1																					
75	75		301									Mandhasti finishes his heroic speech, then wipes his face with a slight look of shame.																						
76	76		301								Roland	For the safety of the city, I won't give up. But I will also abide by your teachings, Mandy.	2																					
77	77		301								Roland	...But you put yourself at risk standing in front of his gun like that.	2																					
78	78		301								Roland	You don't want me to get hurt, but don't be an idiot and get yourself hurt either.	2																					
79	79		301								Mandhasti	Hahaha, takes one to know one. What can I say? I was worried about you.	1																					
80	80		301								Mandhasti	But I'm sure you can tell that the bulletproof vest took the brunt of it.	1																					
81	81		301								Mandhasti	Besides, there's something I wanted to confirm...	1																					
82	82		301								Roland	?	2																					
83	83		301								Mandhasti	Heh, forget it. Let's lighten the mood.	1																					
84	84		301								Mandhasti	Ya know, the last time I came here, I saw a huge robot beside the alleyway. It was as tall as a building and the same color as the wall. I've lived in this city for ages, but I only just noticed it.	1																					
85	85		301								Mandhasti	And looking in the direction of the robot, I saw someone. Wanna guess who?	1																					
86	86		301								Roland	...How would I know?	2																					
87	87		301								Roland	I think we should save this for later. I think you should take the intel back to HQ. I need to report back to the station.	2																					
88	88		301								Mandhasti	But you're hurt...	1																					
89	89		204							2																								
90	90		301								Roland	Good thing I have fast-acting Med Spray from Rococo with me. One easy spray stops bleeding on the spot. It's painless and itch-free! And it even comes with advanced color-treatment to make the wound disappear in the blink of an eye! The police station always keeps it in stock.	2																					
91	91		301								Roland	Here, let me show you. It's available for purchase at your local pharmacy.	2																					
92	92		301								Mandhasti	Well, looks like I don't have to worry about you. See you around, Roland.	1																					
93	93		202							1	2				1																			
94	94		301									Mandhasti stands up, takes the USB from Roland and salutes him. In response, Roland adjusts his clothes and fastens the baton around his waist. Then, with one hand behind his back, he bows gently to Mandhasti.																						
95	95		201							1	500369		-400																					
96	96		201							2	500365		400																					
97	97		301							1	Roland	For the sake of our common dream.	2																					
98	98		301								Mandhasti	For the sake of our common dream.	1																					
99	99		202							1	2				1																			
100	100		401							2	1516																							
101	101		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					After that, Mandhasti quickly leaves with the USB. Roland heads in the opposite direction, out of the alley and onto the street.																						
102	102		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory424.jpg																								
103	103		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Dazzling sunlight shines on his face. Squinting from the brightness, he sees an empty street before him.																						
104	104		201							1	500365	5																						
105	105		301							1	Roland	Take forever why don'tcha...	1																					
106	106		202							1					1																			
107	107		301									Roland quickly takes a few steps into the shade to hide from the sunlight. Just a few moments prior, the street was crowded with people. But now, there is not a soul in sight.																						
108	108		301									Roland doesn't seem surprised. Instead, he casually leans up against the wall in the shade, then tosses the spray can in his hand and catches it. He seems to be waiting for something... like a signal‚Äî																						
109	109		301								Earpiece	Cut!																						
110	110		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					He hears a loud cry from his earpiece. Roland turns around and feels around for a gap in the wall. Sliding it open, a large room opens up in front of him.																						
111	111		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory232.png																								
112	112		401							1	205																							
113	113		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						A large crowd of people wearing an assortment of clothes is in the room. Holo-screens displaying city scenes and data analytics are scattered throughout the room.																						
114	114		301								Staff Member A	Lead in Sector N0R confirmed. Extras are in position. Next scene is on the daily set.																						
115	115		301								Staff Member A	In the last scene, the crane mentioned by the leading actor was an unexpected accident. There's a risk that the leading actor will discover the truth about the studio. I've contacted the prop team to modify it immediately.																						
116	116		301								Staff Member B	The environment simulator in Sector M1L is having issues with humidity control. I've spoken with the set designers. They said they can have it done before the fourth act tonight.																						
117	117		301								Staff Member B	Keep the alley set to maintain continuity. The script will have our lead return here.																						
118	118		301								Staff Member C	Just have to restart the holographic camouflage, right? Fine, I'll go...																						
119	119		201							1	500382																							
120	120		301							1	Gangster	Hey! Hey! Roland!	1																					
121	121		202							1					1																			
122	122		301									Roland walks straight through the crowd. A man in black standing in a corner waves at him. He has a pistol holstered at his waist. His voice is low and resonant like a drum. He is clearly the gangster who had pinned Roland to the ground from earlier...																						
123	123		301									However, this time when he sees Roland, he pats him on the shoulder in a friendly manner as if they have been colleagues for many years.																						
124	124		201							1	500382		400																					
125	125		201							2	500365		-400																					
126	126		301							1	Gangster	Sorry about that back there. I went a little overboard. Great job, though.	1																					
127	127		301								Roland	Hehehe... What can I say? I've got some experience playing the victim. No need to suck up to me, Neferti.	2																					
128	128		401							2	1515																							
129	129		301								Roland	Hm? Instructions from the director? Alright, what is it?	2																					
130	130		301								Roland	Alright, I see. Got it.	2																					
131	131		202							1	2				1																			
132	132		301									Roland covers his earpiece and goes to the center of the workshop. A few moments later, he lifts his chin and raises his hands as if commanding the crowd.																						
133	133		201							1	500365																							
134	134		301							1	Roland	Alright, everyone! You're all doing great, but we need to drop what we're doing. The director says we need to shoot a new ad read.	1																					
135	135		301								Roland	No need for a new wardrobe and make-up. We need to start filming immediately.	1																					
136	136		301								Roland	Camera crew ready?	1																					
137	137		201							1	500140																							
138	138		301							1	Cameraman	Ready. Cameras in position.	1																					
139	139		202							1					1																			
140	140		301									The crewmember waves his hands, signaling several gun-shaped cameras to descend from the ceiling. The round lenses all point at Roland. Roland smiles in confirmation.																						
141	141		201							1	500365																							
142	142		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Roland	Phew...	1

144	144		202							1					1																			
145	145		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Roland	(Relax. Take a deep breathe. You already know all your lines.)																						
146	146		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	(All you gotta do is act like you do in front of Mandhasti. Just smile and recite your lines.)																						
147	147		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cgqz2701.jpg																								
148	148		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Cameraman	Three, two, one, action!	1																					
149	149		301								Roland	‚ÄîHola, amigo!																						
150	150		301								Roland	In this golden age, are you tired of watching mechanoid performances without any tension? Are you tired of watching stand-ins give lack-luster performances? Look no further! The performance here is so genuine, it's real!																						
151	151		301								Roland	No over-the-top stunts, no smoke and mirrors, no editing magic. This broadcast is live in real-time! Watch our human protagonist's genuine, nail-biting reactions to living in this city rife with danger!																						
152	152		301									Roland raises his hands outward as if gently inviting the audience into his embrace. His speech is quick-witted and to the point. He has repeated this performance thousands of times. This time is just like any other.																						
153	153		301								Roland	Today marks another anniversary for our reality show, "The Mandhasti Real Park"! Without using any special effects, our studio has crafted this story all for Mandhasti! From baby to adult, Mandhasti's grown up right before your very eyes!																						
154	154		301								Roland	After all these years, he's finally grown up. Now, as a sheriff who carries out justice, Mandhasti fights for his dreams to bring peace to the city! And I, Roland, as his knight, will sacrifice my life for our dreams! From now on, how will Mandhasti's career as a sheriff change? Watch and see!																						
155	155		301								Roland	Enjoy exciting stories, genuine experiences and answers to life's toughest questions! This is our reality show! This absolutely true story is a masterpiece of this era!																						
156	156		301								Roland	Damas y caballeros (Ladies and gentlemen), the show is about to begin!																						
157	157		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	Lastly, a word from our sponsor. Starting next week, entertainment pioneer and sponsor of "The Mandhasti Real Park", Rococo Inc., will be offering a discount on our restreaming service. Participants will also receive a box of Rococo's premium espresso coffee! Drowsy? Have some Rococo!																						
158	159		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory232.png																								
159	158		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Staff Member	Cut! Right on the first take. Great work, Roland.																						
160	160		201							1	500365																							
161	161		301							1	Roland	Considering how many times we've done it, I better. Hahaha!	1																					
162	162		301								Roland	Phew... Next up, how are the ratings? (Nods) Good. Looks like the remix is popular with the fans. Next time, I'll talk to the screenwriter about broadcasting it during the showdown.	1																					
163	163		301								Roland	Everything else okay with the ratings? Sweet, looks like I'm up on the ratings. Guess I'll keep at it. Great job to everyone else who made the list. Keep up the hard work.	1																					
164	164		203							1	0.25	-400																						
165	165		201							2	500382		400																					
166	166		301							1	Neferti	Keep at it, and you'll be more popular than the star of the show. Great work, Roland.	2																					
167	167		301								Roland	Pff, it's nothing. I couldn't do it without the script and everyone's help.	1																					
168	168		301								Roland	Alright, enough brown-nosing, Neferti. Is the frame Omi mentioned for the next job ready yet or not?	1																					
169	169		301								Neferti	They're workin' on it. She's the lead actress. Think they're just messing around? After all, frames are a dime a dozen, but mainstream frames are too conspicuous. The lead may get suspicious. So they need to disguise it.	2																					
170	170		301								Roland	Copy that. It sure would be awful for Mandhasti to find out that he's spent his entire life in a studio all thanks to a tiny slip-up, huh?	1																					
171	171		301								Roland	Oh, by the way, is it time to talk with viewers?	1																					
172	172		301								Neferti	Yes. We received a call from one just now. You know the one who started a fight for the communication quota at the exhibition?	2																					
173	173		301								Roland	That overbearing woman? Joy...	1																					
174	174		301								Roland	She just loves making problems out of nothing. I get goosebumps every time she calls my name. Last time, she pestered me for half an hour. I had ten shots of espresso just to deal with her.	1																					
175	175		301								Roland	We've been a hit with advertisers recently. We've been shooting ads all week. Aside from the medical spray, we've got three product placements lined up for the show. But we don't have enough time, so we'll just have to hologram them in.	1																					
176	176		301								Roland	If the cameras can't hide it, you'll have to step in. You know Roland's character, right? I reprogrammed the voice modulator and motion simulator, so there shouldn't be any discrepancy.	1																					
177	177		301								Neferti	No problem. I don't mind stepping in your shoes for a bit.	2
