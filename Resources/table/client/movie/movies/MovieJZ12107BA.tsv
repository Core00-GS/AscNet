3	3		301			DialogEnable						No. 21 sees her face reflecting on the clean glass. Her image is projected onto an area of flat buildings.																						
4	4		301									The colors here are bright; the sunlight is supple. Everything seems to be composed of neatly cut white squares.																						
5	5		301									A few hours prior, she and Vera were put into a Sleeping Pod. After a steady journey, they finally ended up here.																						
6	6		301									Vera is quietly standing beside her. She looks around curiously as she observes her surroundings.																						
7	7		301									The door in front of them opens and a woman walks out from within.

15	15		301									Vera remains motionless. The woman walks around them and proceeds directly to the other side of the corridor. No. 21 smells a faint fragrance on her.

17	17		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					As she walks by, sunlight projects into the room through the gap in the door. The scene within the room begins to unfold in front of No. 21.

19	19		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						In the dim room, two men are sitting in the shadows. One of them is sitting at the table. Underneath his meticulous white hairline, his eyes hold a sharp gaze, like that of a hawk or falcon used for hunting.																						
20	20		301									The other has his back turned to No. 21. His rough and messy red hair on the back of his head looks like fur.

23	23		301									No. 21 looks away at Vera, whose eyebrows are tightly furrowed. She cannot decipher Vera's expression. After scanning the room, Vera's gaze shifts to the older man sitting behind the desk.

27	27		301								Nikola	That's Nikola, Commander of the Babylonia Parliament.	2																					
28	28		301									The man slowly corrects Vera's address.																						
29	29		301								Nikola	Constructs Vera and No. 21, you have been officially transferred to Babylonia's Task Force under my direct supervision.	2

34	34		301									No. 21 understands every word the man says, but when put together like that, she has difficulty understanding him. She repeats the only word she could pick out—Babylonia.

39	39		301									Vera cuts him off, crosses her arms, then fixes her glare on the other man.																						
40	40		301								Nikola	I'd recommend you keep your arrogance in check now that you're here. Hmph... Anyway. You'll be filled in later.	2																					
41	41		301								Vera	Why us?	1																					
42	42		301								Vera	There's a ton of other Constructs in Kurono. Why my team?	1

44	44		301								Nikola	Hah... Team. Can two Constructs without a commandant really be called a team?	2																					
45	45		301								Nikola	"Why" doesn't matter. Soon, you'll officially have... something more worthy of being called a "team."	2

47	47		301									The older man knocks on the table. As if he has received a signal, the man with his back to them turns his head. Sunlight only falls on half of his face.																						
48	48		301									Half of his body is hidden in the shadows and half is exposed to the sun. He leans back in his chair and turns to look at Vera.																						
49	49		301								???	Hmph. Am I really going to be stuck with you two?																						
50	50		301									The red-haired man smiles, showing his fangs like a vicious dog.
