11	11		302								...	12																						
12	12		301									Suddenly, you step on something hard buried in the snow. The day is dark, but with the dim light, you can vaguely tell it is a corpse dressed in a military protective suit.

14	14		401							2	1543																							
15	15		301									You lay your hands on the corpse's neck. It is cold and stiff. Then, you rip off a slightly-worn name tag.

22	22		401							2	1516																							
23	23		301									Hurried footsteps come from outside the door. A figure in pink pushes open the door and looks at you with a worried look on her face.

25	25		301							1	Liv	Morning, Commandant... Did you have a nightmare?	1																					
26	26		302								Yeah...	27																						
27	27		301									Liv takes out the handkerchief that she always carries with her and wipes away the sweat on your forehead.																						
28	28		301								Liv	What did you see in the dream?	1																					
29	29		302								A cold winter that lasted for decades.	30																						
30	30		302								I died in the winter.	31																						
31	31		301								Liv	...	1																					
32	32		204							1	1																							
33	33		301								Liv	It's okay. The nightmare is over.	1																					
34	34		302								Phew.	35																						
35	35		301									You let out a sigh and notice that you are not familiar with this room.																						
36	36		302								What is this place?	37																						
37	37		204							1	3																							
38	38		401							1	208																							
39	39		301								Liv	What? You don't recognize it? This is our home. The four of us live together now.	1

41	41		204							1	1																							
42	42		301								Liv	Lucia, Lee... you, and me.	1																					
43	43		301								Liv	Five years ago, the disaster caused by the Punishing Virus came to an end. Now, we are rebuilding a town in the western part of the world.	1																					
44	44		302								...?	45																						
45	45		301									You try to search your memories, but everything is fragmented and blurred. You can't seem to reminisce much.																						
46	46		302								I don't quite remember any of this.	47																						
47	47		204							1	3																							
48	48		301								Liv	Well... It's probably because of your head injury.	1																					
49	49		301								Liv	You have recovered, but since that day, you haven't been able to recall your memories.	1																					
50	50		302								...	51																						
51	51		204							1																								
52	52		301									She caresses your head where a scar once was. It is not there anymore, but Liv remembers exactly where it used to be.																						
53	53		301								Liv	...Let me take a look.	1																					
54	54		204							1	10																							
55	55		301									The girl closes her eyes and uses the built-in diagnostic device of her Support frame to do a basic examination.																						
56	56		204							1	3																							
57	57		301								Liv	Hmm... Looks like you've been too tired lately.	1																					
58	58		301								Liv	You helped us greatly when we were rebuilding.	1																					
59	59		301									Having come to such a conclusion, she still looks worried. With her hands holding your head, she looks at you while stroking your cheek with her skinny fingers.																						
60	60		204							1	4																							
61	61		301								Liv	I'll give you another examination tonight. Take it easy today.	1																					
62	62		302								Today?	63																						
63	63		204							1	1																							
64	64		301								Liv	Yes. We agreed yesterday that we would hang out at the newly built amusement park together.	1																					
65	65		202							1					1																			
66	66		301									Though she wants to spend more time with you, Liv turns around, takes out an outfit from the wardrobe, and puts it on the corner of your bed.																						
67	67		201							1	1031001	1																						
68	68		301							1	Liv	It's 10 am now. We'll leave at 11, Commandant.	1																					
69	69		301								Liv	Would you like me to help you get dressed?	1																					
70	70		302								No, thank you. I can do it myself.	71																						
71	71		301								Liv	Well, breakfast is ready. Lucia and Lee are waiting for you downstairs.	1																					
72	72		301								Liv	...I'll be there too.	1																					
73	73		202							1					1																			
74	74		301									With an amiable smile on her face, she nods at you and leaves the room.																						
75	75		302								...	76																						
76	76		301									Something doesn't seem right. No matter how hard you try to remember, you just cannot reminisce about anything that seems out of place.																						
77	77		301									You feel like you should remember something about how the Punishing Virus disaster ended five years ago and how Gray Raven helped people rebuild their homes.																						
78	78		301									But the memories are vague and strange. It is almost like you are reliving someone else's memories.																						
79	79		301									Perhaps it is as Liv said. The nightmare you had was too realistic and long-lasting. Is that why you are having trouble recalling memories?																						
80	80		301								Liv	—Commandant!																						
81	81		301									You hear Liv asking for you from downstairs.

86	86		302								Sure, why not?	87	Nah. Forget about it.	90																				
87	87		301								Lee	...	1																					
88	88		301								Lee	Then another leader would try to wake you up.	1																					
89	89		302								That's not bad either.	90	Now that there are no more tasks for us to do, he probably won't behave like that anymore.	90																				
90	90		301									Lee frowns and looks like he wants to say something. But before he can speak, Lucia comes in from another room and interrupts him.

95	95		301								Lucia	Liv made breakfast today. Lee and I didn't help much.	2

104	104		302								Yeah...	105																						
105	105		302								(Explaining your dream)	106																						
106	106		301								Lucia	That reminds me of the Gestalt Theory.	2																					
107	107		301								Liv	Speaking of which... I think I too have heard of it.	1																					
108	108		301								Liv	By Gestalt's calculation, we only had a 0.031% chance of living through disasters and war.	1																					
109	109		301								Lucia	That was a reckless move to make, after all.	2																					
110	110		301								Liv	Well, hadn't it been the miracle that day, we would've all died in that unforgiving winter.	1																					
111	111		302								...A miracle.	112																						
112	112		301									You repeat these words in your mind and realize they don't sound strange at all.																						
113	113		301									Before the war came to an end, these words had become a synonym for several humans and Constructs that were able to create miracles. And apparently, you were amongst them.																						
114	114		301									In the sea of blurred memories, you recall the speech of peace given by Hassen, "Every survivor who stands here today is a child of miracles."																						
115	115		301									But are you really... standing here today?																						
116	116		204							1	1																							
117	117		204							2	1																							
118	118		301								Liv	But those things are in the past. There's nothing to be worried about now.	1																					
119	119		301								Lucia	All we have to do is rebuild our home.	2																					
120	120		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	Well, it has been only five years, but since we started using machines to help with the rebuild, things have been moving forward much faster.	1

124	124		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						While they are having a conversation, you look at the bedroom and see sunlight shining through the leaves and into the room.																						
125	125		301									A few birds flap their wings and fly to the treetop, chirping and tweeting while dancing in the shades.																						
126	126		301									All of this is a sign of what you've been hoping for: peace.

128	128		301							1	Liv	Commandant, do you not like your breakfast?	1

131	131		301							1	Lee	Commandant's probably just spacing out.	1																					
132	132		302								Not really. I'm just thinking...	133																						
133	133		302								It's peaceful now. But is this real?	134																						
134	134		201							1	1031001	19																						
135	135		301							1	Liv	...Commandant...	1

139	139		301							1	Lucia	Is it PTSD? I heard that many retired Commandants suffer from that.	2																					
140	140		301								Liv	I am not very good at mental diagnosis. When we are done today, I'll take you to the hospital and get you checked.	1																					
141	141		302								That won't be necessary.	142	Alright.	143																				
142	142	144	301								Liv	Well, let's do it.	1

148	148		302								Okay.	149																						
149	149		301									You drink up the scoop of soup. It tastes as sweet as Liv's smile.																						
150	150		301									During the endless fighting, every soldier was hoping for peace as you are living now. They just didn't realize it.																						
151	151		301									And now, you have awakened from the long-lasting nightmare you were previously trapped in. This beautiful world is your new reality.
