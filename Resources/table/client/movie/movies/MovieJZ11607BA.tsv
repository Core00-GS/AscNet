38	37		301									I wonder if he'd just seen through me, or did he simply decide to choose for me?																						
39	102		301									Either way, that was when I found out who I am. I gained the freedom I'd earned, despite it coming in woeful shades of grey.

51	201		301				RImgBg1Disable					He had sent out countless distress signals with information on the Nighter, messages that had remained on radio frequency unanswered—intel that will one day be intercepted by "421."
