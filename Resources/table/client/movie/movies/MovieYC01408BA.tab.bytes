8	8		301									With Lamia's retreat, the Corrupted begin to withdraw. The battle, however, has still yet to cease.																						
9	9		301									The Corrupted were but a catalyst for hatred. The war has its roots in something deeper.																						
10	10		301									The wounds of war grow, the roars and warcries too.																						
11	11		201							1	500211																							
12	12		301							1	Martin	It's too late...	1																					
13	13		202							1																								
14	14		301									Martin and the others might have done all they could to eliminate the Corrupted, but they have no way to stop this war. After all, who would listen to these outliers?																						
15	15		301									They can but only stand far, bearing witness to the transience before them.																						
16	16		301									Or, perhaps, someone might have held an answer to ending this war. An answer that is not defeating the opponent, nor running and leaving the problems behind.																						
17	17		301									But instead, facing their mistakes‚Äîthe mistakes made in that loathsome and horrible past.																						
18	18		301									And that is when they hear the voice ringing throughout the battlefield.																						
19	19		301								Ringing Voice	I'm... sorry.

26	26		202							1																								
27	27		301									Everyone's communication channels somehow became connected. From a thunderous explosion in the distance, the apology fluttered over.																						
28	28		301									An apology like a pity-breathing sigh, trailing with tears.																						
29	29		301									The ARU and the bionic machines both pause.																						
30	30		301									Slowly, they began to realize the meaning behind these few words.																						
31	31		201							1	500208																							
32	32		301							1	Angry Bear	Hey, why are you stopping?! We should seize the opportunity and attack!	1																					
33	33		201							1	500091	1																						
34	34		301							1	Nanami	It's all over!	1																					
35	35		202							1																								
36	36		301									Nanami hurls her chainsaw before the warmongering bear model, stopping him in his tracks.																						
37	37		201							1	500208																							
38	38		301							1	Angry Bear	What?!	1																					
39	39		201							1	500091	14																						
40	40		301							1	Nanami	That's enough! You heard it too, right? Amberia must have said something as well!	1																					
41	41		201							1	500208																							
42	42		301							1	Angry Bear	You broke all our receivers! How could we hear Amberia!	1																					
43	43		201							1	500091	14																						
44	44		301							1	Nanami	Even so... You must still be connected to her in some way!	1																					
45	45		301								Nanami	You must know what Amberia would have said at her final moments!	1																					
46	46		201							1	500199																							
47	47		301							1	Staessen	That means... Amberia is...	1																					
48	48		202							1																								
49	49		301									Staessen realizes the situation through Nanami's words. The explosion likely came from where Amberia was at. As for the apology, that must be what Rosetta said to Amberia.																						
50	50		201							1	500087																							
51	51		301							1	Fisher	Amberia... Wha...? Wasn't Amberia 'posed to be long...	1																					
52	52		201							1	500088	4

54	54		201							1	500199																							
55	55		301							1	Staessen	It's all my fault!	1																					
56	56		201							1	500088	4																						
57	57		301							1	Diana	Captain?!	1																					
58	58		201							1	500201	10																						
59	59		301							1	Simon	Captain, what's... Ugh...	1																					
60	60		201							1	500199																							
61	61		301							1	Staessen	Just lay still, wobbly!	1																					
62	62		301									Staessen and Simon march out of the crowd. Like Nanami, they stand between the two conflicting armies.																						
63	63		301								Staessen	Amberia... was the greatest sacrifice of the ARU. She was the living proof of our foolishness in the past.	1																					
64	64		301								Staessen	The commanding captain at the time concealed Amberia in an underground base, which caused the tides, the invasions that endlessly tormented the ARU.	1																					
65	65		301								Staessen	No... or should I say. This caused an irreparable gap between us and the bionics.	1																					
66	66		201							1	500087																							
67	67		301							1	Fisher	Capt., you hiding this from us the whole time? You just let that thing be? What if Amberia went gaga like before...?	1																					
68	68		201							1	500199	5																						
69	69		301							1	Staessen	That's why I said she's proof of our foolishness! And I'm just another gimboid like them old duds!	1																					
70	70		301									Staessen's roar stops the indignant fisherman. He continues.																						
71	71		301								Staessen	We've both paid more than enough for the past! Do whatever you want with me! I'll tell you everything you want to know! Just...	1																					
72	72		301								Staessen	Just listen up, everyone! You too, bionics! This is the captain's orders!	1																					
73	73		301								Staessen	Stop this war AT ONCE! Stop all the fighting! I'm not repeating myself! If you don't listen, you'll be branded a sinner...	1																					
74	74		301								Staessen	...No, that ain't right. That's not what I'm tryna say... The Forest Guards aren't sinners... I...	1																					
75	75		301								Staessen	Just... Just...! Everything's over with! It's all over!	1																					
76	76		202							1																								
77	77		301									Staessen cries in the middle of his speech. He himself cannot understand why he did.																						
78	78		301									Was it from the relief of the ebbing danger? Or certain decisions and resolves in his heart?																						
79	79		301									As if infected by Staessen, tears also begin to dot the others faces. They support their wounded companions and retreat. Some throw their weapons onto the ground.																						
80	80		301									The same atmosphere permeates the bionics.																						
81	81		201							1	500208																							
82	82		301							1	Angry Bear	Amberia... She... she...!	1																					
83	83		201							1	500211																							
84	84		301							1	Martin	I think I heard our mother-frame at her last moments. She said... Thank you... Did she not?	1

89	89		301			DialogEnable						Martin's words break the dam in the bear model's heart. He loosens his fists and curls up to cry.																						
90	90		301									Under the aurora, humans, Constructs, and machines all begin crying for the past.																						
91	91		301									Amidst the cries, Nanami steps before the once-angry bear model. She places her hand on his head, ruffling through his fur.																						
92	92		301								Nanami	You know, words can become prayers. And prayers can help you move on.																						
93	93		301								Nanami	...It's okay now.

110	109		301									The sun rises like a fiery jewel above the ice-strewn sea. Nanami, leading and along with the bionics, perform a series of unfathomable poses to welcome this sight.																						
111	110		301								Martin	...Speaking of, Nanami. What should we do now?	1																					
112	111		201							1	500091	8																						
113	112		301							1	Nanami	Wha‚ÄîHey, that's Nanami's question for you! Why did you all come with Nanami anyways?! You're not living with humans like the other bionics?	1																					
114	113		201							1	500211																							
115	114		301							1	Martin	Well... The humans will probably say nothing about it, but it still feels kinda weird living with the humans after the Amberia stuff, so...	1																					
116	115		201							1	500091																							
117	116		301							1	Nanami	Do you all feel that way?	1
