3	3		301			DialogEnable						Breezy night. White beaches. Salty air.																						
4	4		301									You push yourself up from the sand. Some seems to have gotten into your mouth.																						
5	5		302								...Bleugh.	6																						
6	6		301									This place is... Venus Splash Park.																						
7	7		301									Unlike the last time you were here, you see the entire water park ablaze with lights. Joyous Golden Age tunes, played by an accordion, wander into your ears.																						
8	8		301									You walk toward the water park. On your way there, you see more and more service robots.																						
9	9		401							1	205																							
10	10		301								Cathy?	Have a lookie! Have a gander! Would you like a live performance, friend?																						
11	11		301								Martini?	Hey buddy, want a glass of martini?																						
12	12		301									Deftly rotating the wheel beneath it, the service robot slides before you while holding a plate with two of its arms. It bows using the other two mechanical arms in a gentlemanly manner.																						
13	13		302								No thanks...	14	(Now's not the time for this.)	14																				
14	14		301								Martini?	Ahah, right! Underage drinking is illegal.																						
15	15		301									The robot announces in a blaring robotic tone. It turns, splashing you with some of the content inside the glasses. Proceeding to completely ignore you, it continues on its quest to provide martini for humans.																						
16	16		302								...	17	...Underage?	17																				
17	17		301								Cathy?	A customer! A customer! Another one! Another customer!																						
18	18		302								Another?	19	Are there other people here?	19																				
19	19		301								Cathy?	Please, good fellow. Come with me! Come with me!																						
20	20		301									The dainty looking robot jumps up and down before you. It must have too much energy.

23	22		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Cathy?	The greatest performance is now live at Venus Splash Park!																						
24	23		301									The robot tugs you, leading you before a building. You see the watermelon A'Mao selling ice cream and souvenirs there. Several other robots are also cheerfully giving away snacks and toys.																						
25	24		301								A'Mao?	Here, kiddo. Have this.																						
26	25		302								No thanks...	26	Uh, thanks.	28																				
27	26		301									Completely ignoring your response, the watermelon stuffs a multicolored package into your hands.																						
28	27		302								...Fine.	28																						
29	28		301								A'Mao?	Yay! Haha! Yay!																						
30	29		301									Seeing you receive the gift, the watermelon cheerily yelps and rolls away into the distance.

33	32		401							1	209																							
34	33		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The Cathy unit eventually leads you to a theater hall. You make out a banner scrawled with crayoned letters of "Death of Shome" on top of the stage.																						
35	34		302								...What kind of cult is this?	35																						
36	35		301									You look for Luna in the dim-lit spectator area, but instead find every other single robot gazing heatedly at you. Their eyes flicker in an eerie sheen, looking all the more terrifying in the darkness.																						
37	36		302								...Let's not try anything, just yet.																							
38	37		201							1	500177																							
39	38		301							1	Shark-speare?	Showtime! Showtime!	1																					
40	39		301									A spotlight flares up in the middle of the theater stage. Shark-speare, who has gotten on it since who-knows-when, is heralding the start of the show.																						
41	40		301								Shark-speare?	Showtime! Showtime!	1																					
42	41		301									Shark-speare's head falls off, revealing Shome's face inside, indignantly blinking.																						
43	42		401							1	202																							
44	43		201							1	500178																							
45	44		301							1	Shome?	Luna, do you really think you have everything under your control?	1																					
46	45		301								Shome?	Do you really think no one knows what you're planning?	1																					
47	46		301								Shome?	You must be disappointed! Before you learned of the truth from me, have you ever thought that you'd be stripped of your status as an agent?	1																					
48	47		301								Shome?	How does it feel when things go awry? But this is nothing! NOTHING, compared to the pain you have caused in others...!	1																					
49	48		301								Shome?	You will NEVER find happiness in your life! Not this one, not your next, or the one after!	1																					
50	49		301								Shome?	Repent by suffering for a thousandfold the pain you've caused! You deserve this! And your sister too, must bear the burden of your sin...	1																					
51	996		202							1																								
52	51		301								Luna	...Shut up!																						
53	52		301									Luna's voice reverberates from a corner in the darkness, audibly irate. The robots all stare at her fixedly.																						
54	53		301								Luna	Why... are you all looking at me like that...																						
55	54		301								Luna	No... Go away!																						
56	55		302								Luna!	57																						
57	57		301									In the few moments where you were taken by the play, the robots seem to have grown in numbers. You try to leave your seat, but the walls upon walls of steel block your way. The darkness does little to help you find Luna.																						
58	58		302								...The stage.	59																						
59	59		301									Fumbling around, you manage to crawl to the stage. You pull apart the heavy curtains and somehow find the spotlights trained upon you.																						
60	60		302								Hey! Look over here!	61	Free her!	61																				
61	61		301									You catch the attention of the robots. They rush at you, like ants swarming around honey.																						
62	62		301									With the mechanoids dispersed around her, you see that Luna has been standing next to the exit.																						
63	63		201							1	500238	4																						
64	64		301							1	Luna	...	1																					
65	65		301									She notices your gaze, but there is a lost expression about her. Her eyes meet yours over the sheets of mechanoids in the spectator seats, eventually focusing on them.																						
66	66		302								Stay there.	67																						
67	67		301									You mouth the words. You cannot tell if she heard you, but she does stand there, still and silent.																						
68	68		202							1					1																			
69	69		301									Looking around, you settle your sights on a banner around the stage, one dangling with balloons and ribbons.																						
70	70		301									You fish out the gift the watermelon gave you earlier and fashion a lasso out of the packaging ribbon. Giving it a good throw, it latches onto the banner. Then testing it for integrity, you hop and take to the air.

72	888		401							2	1512																							
73	71		301									As the wall grows closer and closer, you let go, mentally judging the distance. You land perfectly... with a thud, right next to a mechanoid.																						
74	72		201							1	500238	4																						
75	73		301							1	Luna	...	1																					
76	74		302								I'm fine!	75	Just a tiny accident.	75																				
77	75		301									The mechanoids take immediate notice of you. Without another word, you grab Luna's hand and run.																						
78	76		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Just like the last time.																						
79	997		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory203.png																								
80	77		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Luna	Where are we going?	1																					
81	78		301									But this time, she does not struggle like the last. And from her question, she seems to know nothing about the water park.																						
82	79		302								Somewhere they can't reach us.	80	The highest place there is!	82																				
83	80		301								Luna	So... where?	1																					
84	81		302								The highest place!	82																						
85	82		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Luna	The highest place...?	1

88	85		401							1	103																							
89	86		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You both hurtle out of the theater, leaving behind everythingâ€”the lights, the music, the bands of mechanoids. Only the whistling wind grazes the two of you.																						
90	87		301									Luna's hand is slender, delicate to the point that it feels brittle. To think such world-ending power hides within...																						
91	88		301									The ethereal lightness of Luna almost gives you an illusion that you are flying a kite by dragging her along.																						
92	89		301									And so, the two of you reach the entrance of the tallest building in the water park... the Ferris Wheel.																						
93	90		302								...	91																						
94	91		201							1	500238																							
95	92		301							1	Luna	Is this... the highest place?	1																					
96	93		302								It should be...	94	Just one thing...	94																				
97	94		202							1					1																			
98	95		301									The Ferris Wheel looks nothing like you remember. Where there should have been glass capsules are instead pairs upon pairs of roundabout horses.																						
99	96		301									The roundabout horses, exuding a warm orange radiance, are circling each other and rising from the Ferris Wheel. Some mad genius must have decided to... glue a bunch of roundabouts to the attraction.																						
100	97		302								This doesn't look safe at all...	98	No choice...	98																				
101	98		301									As a horse passes in front of you, you grab its head and hop on. You turn to look at Luna.																						
102	99		302								Come on!	100	(Extend your hand)	100																				
103	100		201							1	500238	4																						
104	101		301							1	Luna	...	1																					
105	102		202							1					1																			
106	103		301									Behind her, the mechanoids are screeching in terrible noises and closing in.																						
107	104		301									The world parts into two, freezing in timeâ€”one of a terrifying nightmare, and one of a dreamy wonderland. Luna is caught in-between, looking over at you.																						
108	106		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Then she takes a step forward and catches your hand. And with that, time ticks again.
