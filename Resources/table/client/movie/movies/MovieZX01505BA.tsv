6	6		301								Director	Sigh...	1																					
7	7		301									The director wants to scold Changyu, but all he can muster up is a sigh.

9	9		301							1	Changyu	I just had a run-in with some thugs... No big deal.	1

11	11		301									Changyu replies and looks around the theater. Laoyu is sitting at a table off to the side with Yusheng, who he had not seen for some time.																						
12	12		201							1	500230	1																						
13	13		301							1	Changyu	...Yusheng! Where have you been all this time?	1																					
14	14		301									Changyu perks up with a smile, surprised at the sight of seeing a familiar face after so long.																						
15	15		301								Yusheng	I had some family matters to attend to, so...																						
16	16		301									Yusheng rubs his fingers. His once immaculate white hands are now wrapped in bandages.																						
17	17		301								Yusheng	You're back just in time. I wanted to bid you all farewell.																						
18	18		204							1																								
19	19		301								Changyu	Farewell? Where are you going?	1																					
20	20		301								Yusheng	Didn't you hear what Lady Qu said? The Corrupted are coming. I'm going to fight on the frontline.																						
21	21		301								Changyu	Why? I saw some people walking towards the port. Shouldn't we pack up and board the ship together?	1																					
22	22		301									Hearing Changyu's response, Yusheng shakes his head.																						
23	23		301								Yusheng	After listening to the whole speech in the plaza, I choose to believe in Lady Qu.																						
24	24		301								Changyu	Huh? You buy into this whole "will of Kowloong" thing?	1																					
25	25		301								Yusheng	It's my own decision. Lady Qu left the choice to each of us.																						
26	26		301								Yusheng	The ship is not suitable for my sick wife. Staying in the city to participate in the Tabula Akasha is more suitable for us.																						
27	27		301								Changyu	Tabula Akasha? What's that? Forget it. It doesn't matter. So, why are you going to the frontline? What about your wife?	1																					
28	28		301								Yusheng	She's waiting for the Tabula Akasha to begin, but that's going to take some time.																						
29	29		301								Changyu	So you...	1																					
30	30		301								Yusheng	Yes. Someone has to do it, just like Lady Qu and the others.																						
31	31		301								Changyu	Director, try talking some sense into Yusheng.	1																					
32	32		201							1	500229

35	35		301							1	Changyu	What are you doing, Director? Why are you just standing there...? Are you also planning...	1																					
36	36		201							1	500229																							
37	37		301							1	Director	...Yes. I made my own choice as well... I don't want to board the ship and run away. Nor do I want to join the Tabula Akasha. I'm staying here in the theater.	1																					
38	38		301								Director	I can't do something like abandoning my body and living in some machine.	1																					
39	39		301								Director	All I can do is stay with the theater left to me by my ancestors.	1																					
40	40		201							1	500230	5																						
41	41		301							1	Changyu	...In that case, I'll stay here too!	1																					
42	42		201							1	500229																							
43	43		301							1	Director	Quit kidding around! Go upstairs and pack your things. Laoyu, go take Changyu to the port.	1																					
44	44		301								Laoyu	O-of course.																						
45	45		301								Director	You're still young. You shouldn't give up your life like the rest of us.	1																					
46	46		201							1	500230	5

50	50		301							1	Director	Now's not the time to act up!	2																					
51	51		301								Changyu	If you're staying to fight, then count me in! After the war is over, we can continue running the theater. I just finished repairing the props we'll need...	1																					
52	52		301								Director	Changyu, if you really have grown up, then quit being so naive!	2																					
53	53		204							1	14																							
54	54		301								Director	I didn't have the heart to say it, but I sold the theater a long time ago. That's why Yusheng was able to take his wife to see a doctor.	2																					
55	55		301								Director	But who could've imagined something like this would happen before she was cured.	2																					
56	56		301								Director	You are just a child. You can't possibly understand the cruelties of warâ€”we might not survive. This is the last time we'll ever see each other.	2																					
57	57		301								Director	As the director, I appreciate your dedication to the theater... But some things in this world can't be paid back.	2																					
58	58		301								Director	We are just a footnote in the history of Kowloong. We are constantly pushed forward by the flow of time.	2																					
59	59		204							1	21																							
60	60		301								Changyu	Enough!	1																					
61	61		301								Changyu	I just don't want to lose everyone. I want things to go back to normal. You always treat me like a child and make decisions for me. But have you really asked what I think?!	1																					
62	62		301								Director	This is for your own good.	2																					
63	63		301								Changyu	Yes, I know. It's for my own good. I know I've only ever been a child in your eyes.	1																					
64	64		301								Changyu	But I'm still a member of the Kowloong Theater!	1																					
65	65		301								Changyu	Why didn't you tell me anything? I can help!	1																					
66	66		301									Changyu begins to shake with anger, but his eyes remain firm with conviction.																						
67	67		301								Director	Changyu...

70	70		301									A sudden explosion outside the theater interrupts their conversation. Hearing this, Yusheng gets up from his seat.																						
71	71		301								Yusheng	We're out of time... I need to get going. Care to see me off?
