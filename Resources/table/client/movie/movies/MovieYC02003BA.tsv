4	4		301			DialogEnable						Many years ago, at the film set of "The Mandhasti Real Park"—																						
5	5		301									In the studio, a fictional father was teaching his fictional son how to use a rifle.																						
6	6		301									This is the bolt. This is the safety. Here is the magazine, and the trigger is here.																						
7	7		301									Push the bolt to load a shiny, slim bullet, unlock the safety, then pull the trigger.																						
8	8		301									This is how humans fire a brass bullet. It has 2800 joules of kinetic energy, travels at 868 meters per second, and can take down most animals on the continent.																						
9	9		301									The father told his son.																						
10	10		301									"Life is great, but .300 Magnum is greater, because it can take away any life with ease."																						
11	11		301									"It makes no difference whether that life is theirs, or ours. We are just one of the many life forms."																						
12	12		301									For some reason, Roland still remembers this scene that he once witnessed.																						
13	13		301									But he only knew how to act back then. He didn't have any question.																						
14	14		301									The script was there. He only had to follow it to earn money, as well as a chance to live.																						
15	15		301									He had always been living in lies, and believed in the rules that were born in them.																						
16	16		301									But lies could be easily proven wrong with some proper thinking.																						
17	17		301									Does the power to take lives really make something great? It's nothing but an arrogant boast.																						
18	18		301									To Roland, struggling for survival amidst a world that ignores the importance of life should be called great instead. That is the real world.																						
19	19		301									He enjoys watching infected Constructs beg for the mercy of the Ascension-Network. Fragile flowers that shatter after breaking free from the greenhouse, but still struggling to maintain the last bit of consciousness.																						
20	20		301									And the innocent white that was born from the scarlet virus.																						
21	21		301									Those eyes had witnessed infinite despair. Still, she continued to venture toward her target.																						
22	22		301									That white figure pulled him out of hell. The closer he approached her, the more he believed that she was the only truth he would ever seek.																						
23	23		504							0.7																								
24	24		301									But he lost her.																						
25	25		301									What if he never finds Luna again?																						
26	26		504							0																								
27	27		301									What if everything gets loose and lost? Where can he go then?																						
28	28		301									His values and purpose will all go down with the lighthouse.																						
29	29		301									How will he be different from many years ago, when he stood in the "Real Park" with despair?

37	37		301								Roland	...	2																					
38	38		301									The young man in Roland's mind wears a clean and simple outfit. He is smiling—the smile of a normal young person.																						
39	39		301									The smile looks taunting in contrast to Roland's gloomy face.																						
40	40		301								Roland?	You seem upset when I show up, but—	1																					
41	41		301								Roland?	Still, you picked me, not—	1																					
42	42		301								Roland?	Oops, is he not here?	1																					
43	43		301								Roland?	Which means... I see.	1

49	49		301								Roland?	You have an idea. A target. You have a mission—but you don't know how to complete it.	1																					
50	50		301								Roland?	Because nobody can give you a reply without being questioned by you. That's why I'm here.	1																					
51	51		301								Roland	...	2																					
52	52		301								Roland?	Eureka.	1																					
53	53		301								Roland	Guess all you want—but what do you have to say?	2																					
54	54		301								Roland?	I know you don't want to see me. But rest assured, hermano. In this world, anyone can leave you...	1																					
55	55		301								Roland?	But I won't, and I can't. This is my fate, and yours too. Don't you think?	1																					
56	56		301								Roland	Well, hermano, do you have any clue?	2																					
57	57		301								Roland	Get it done. My body is yours for now.	2																					
58	58		301								Roland?	Your body? What sort of impression do you have of me, hermano?	1																					
59	59		301								Roland?	Some electronic ghost may be able to hack into the M.I.N.D. of Constructs through special frequencies, and replace the host's memory with theirs...	1																					
60	60		301								Roland?	But all I can do is to stay with you and face "you" till the last moment.	1																					
61	61		301								Roland?	I don't come from outside, and I'm not another you either. I am just that more honest side of yours.	1																					
62	62		301								Roland?	I cannot interfere with your future. I can only bring up those things that you didn't want to confront.	1																					
63	63		301								Roland?	Whether you like it or not, whatever you are going to do with them, they are there.	1																					
64	64		301								Roland	So what's this thing that I don't want to face?	2																					
65	65		301								Roland?	Relax, hermano. I can see you are arguing back now.	1																					
66	66		301								Roland?	For now, just do what you feel like doing. You want to take action, and that isn't a bad thing.	1

75	75		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Roland?	I don't think you need to keep such a watchful eye on her.	1																					
76	76		301								Roland?	As far as I can recall, you used to get along a lot better.	1																					
77	77		301								Roland	That doesn't mean I can let my guard down, especially in this situation—	2																					
78	78		301								Roland	Just look at me... Hermano.	2																					
79	79		301									Roland raises his right hand. It still obeys his M.I.N.D., but looks nothing like what he remembers.																						
80	80		301								Roland?	So what? You were never a coward.	1																					
81	81		301								Roland?	Has this new body changed you that much?	1																					
82	82		301								Roland	What's wrong with that? I won't have another chance next time.	2																					
83	83		301								Roland	I'm lucky to still be alive, so I must carefully think about how to properly spend this second life.	2																					
84	84		301								Roland?	You would throw away even your own life, yet here you are, suddenly getting nervous over something given by others.	1																					
85	85		301								Roland	...Maybe you are right.	2																					
86	86		301								Roland?	No.	1																					
87	87		301								Roland?	If you want to be a coward, you should have been that way from the beginning. You know very well to be cautious about things you don't understand, so why would you rely on this new body that you aren't familiar with?	1																					
88	88		301								Roland	...?	2																					
89	89		301								Roland?	This life may be given by The Merciful One, but it's still yours.	1																					
90	90		301								Roland?	It's your choice. Your consequence. Your soul. Everything about it belongs to you.	1																					
91	91		301								Roland?	If you want to fight, to die, or to do stupid things, you do it yourself.	1																					
92	92		301								Roland?	Look at you, so detached and paranoid. You made yourself this way.	1																					
93	93		301								Roland	Looks like you are right.	2																					
94	94		204							2	2																							
95	95		301									Roland's expression relaxes slightly and gives a chuckle.																						
96	96		301									With his nerves loosened, he gazes around the place. It is—or, used to be—a low-ceiling hut.																						
97	97		301									Bombshells destroyed one of the walls, as well as half of the south-eastern pillar, making its roof slightly tilted.																						
98	98		301									Still, the remaining structures are intact, making the room at least more comfortable than some random cave.																						
99	99		301									Lamia would probably agree. She curls up like a cat, occupying a corner of the room.																						
100	100		301									—Roland feels relieved.																						
101	101		301								Roland	Can you stay a little longer?	2																					
102	102		301								Roland?	My presence is not determined by your words. But you will know when I show up or leave.	1																					
103	103		301								Roland?	Hermano.	1																					
104	104		301									The illusion emphasizes the word "hermano."																						
105	105		301								Roland	...Hah, you're right.	2																					
106	106		301									...

108	108		301								Roland	Anyway, I sometimes have this feeling...	2																					
109	109		301								Roland?	?	1
