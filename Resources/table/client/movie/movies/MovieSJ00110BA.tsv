7	7		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Amberia	What's next? What's next? Does the prince cut through the thorns and climb to the top of the tower? Does he save the princess?																						
8	8		301								Mother	Of course... "The prince finally climbs up the staircase to the very top of the tower..."																						
9	9		301								Amberia	Yeah—!																						
10	10		301									Mommy smiled. She turned the page of the book, and then continued to read the story in her usual gentle voice that I cherished so much.																						
11	11		301									Daddy sat on the sofa with a glass of wine and listened to Mommy telling me the story.																						
12	12		301									I may not be able to run freely like the other children, but as long as Mommy tells me adventure stories and fairy tales, I can still experience fantastic adventures.																						
13	13		301									I miss these precious memories of my daily...																						
14	14		301									...By why do I "miss" it? It's not like Mommy and Daddy are gone.																						
15	15		301									But you see, they're right next to me. I'm sitting in Mommy's arms. She's telling me my favorite fairy tale.																						
16	16		301									(Flutters)																						
17	17		301									A rose petal fell onto the page.

20	20		301									More and more rose petals fell as they appeared to be the dyeing the book red. My forehead began to feel cool and wet.																						
21	21		301								Amberia	No... Is this...																						
22	22		301								Amberia	Mommy...?																						
23	23		301									I turned my head to Mommy, but her head just silently hung there.

29	29		301									I screamed in panic and looked for my father on the sofa.																						
30	30		301									But no one answered me. Daddy had already left.																						
31	31		301									A strange "substance" appeared on the couch. It was black and red, just like burned—

36	36		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						I suddenly sat up from my bed and gasped. My parents weren't by my side. This was Niflheim, the ARU's research lab. This was our supposed "care facility".																						
37	37		301								Amberia	Just... just another nightmare.																						
38	38		301								???	Lia?! Are you okay?																						
39	39		301									Someone grabbed my hand and questioned me eagerly.																						
40	40		301								Amberia	Yeah... I'm okay. Thank you, Anfia.																						
41	41		301								Anfia	...Was it another nightmare?																						
42	42		301								Amberia	...Yeah.																						
43	43		301								Amberia	...What happens if a princess has nightmares?																						
44	44		301								Anfia	What?																						
45	45		301								Amberia	What happens if the princess in "Sleeping Beauty" has a nightmare, but she can't wake up?																						
46	46		301								Amberia	No one can wake her up, and no one can save her. She won't be able to wake up from her nightmare...																						
47	47		301									That would be terrifying.																						
48	48		301								Anfia	Wasn't she woken up by a prince? There's nothing to worry about.																						
49	49		301								Anfia	Not to mention, you have me to wake you up from your nightmares.																						
50	50		301								Anfia	I may not be able to fill the room with roses like the prince...																						
51	51		301									Anfia unclenched my hand and placed something in the palm of my hand.																						
52	52		301									It was an origami rose.																						
53	53		301								Anfia	Would this rose... do?																						
54	54		301								Amberia	Anfia...																						
55	55		301								Anfia	You like this kind of flower, don't you?																						
56	56		301								Amberia	Yeah...																						
57	57		301								Anfia	Oh, yeah. I heard that once I become a Construct, I'll have a chance to carry out missions outside the ARU. Maybe I'll see real roses then.																						
58	58		301								Anfia	I'll be sure to show you.																						
59	59		301								Amberia	Okay!																						
60	60		301								Anfia	It'll be my turn to be modified here in a few days. You'll be the first one to see me, Lia! I won't just leave a letter and rush out on a mission like Daniel.																						
61	61		301								Anfia	Oh... The doctor is making his rounds! I gotta get going! See you tomorrow!																						
62	62		301								Amberia	Ok! See you tomorrow, Fia.																						
63	63		301									Anfia skillfully jumped out the window, then gave me an "OK" with her hand from below.																						
64	64		301									Hearing the doctor's periodic footsteps, Anfia quickly retracted her hand and left.																						
65	65		301									I looked towards the direction she left and smiled, then I shifted my gaze at the small origami rose in my hand.

67	67		301							1	Female Researcher	Did she go out the window again?	1																					
68	68		301								Amberia	...																						
69	69		301									The young doctor sighed helplessly, and examined me in her usual gentle manner.																						
70	70		301								Female Researcher	You should be glad that I'm here today. Others wouldn't be so willing to keep your secret.	1																					
71	71		301								Amberia	I still don't understand why you don't let patients in the care facility come in contact with each other...																						
72	72		301									The doctor's gentle eyes faded a moment, and she shook her head silently.																						
73	73		301								Female Researcher	Because it's the rules.	1																					
74	74		301								Female Researcher	...Hm? Is this a rose?	1																					
75	75		301								Amberia	Yeah, Anfia made it.																						
76	76		301									I handed the rose to the doctor, and she took it carefully.																						
77	77		301								Female Researcher	It's beautiful... The last time I saw this kind of rose was when I got engaged.	1																					
78	78		301								Amberia	Huh...? You never mentioned that before.																						
79	79		301								Female Researcher	There was no wedding, no ring. But a small origami rose did the trick. Aren't I something...	1																					
80	80		301								Female Researcher	Anyway, I already have my most precious "gift".	1																					
81	81		301									The doctor subconsciously stroked her belly with a soft, gentle look.																						
82	82		301									—She looked at me the same way my mother did.																						
83	83		301								Amberia	Do you mean...																						
84	84		301									She nodded and held my hand.																						
85	85		301								Female Researcher	Do you want to name the child?	1																					
86	86		301								Amberia	May I...?																						
87	87		301								Female Researcher	Of course.	1																					
88	88		301								Amberia	If she's a girl, how about—																						
89	89		301									I thought a moment before coming up with that name.																						
90	90		301									If I had a daughter, I'd probably give her that name, but the doctor said that becoming a Construct means giving up my human body.																						
91	91		301								Female Researcher	'——'	1																					
92	92		301								Female Researcher	It's a beautiful name. Thank you, Lia.	1																					
93	93		301									I felt warmth gradually spreading in my heart as I looked into the smiling glimmer of her eyes.																						
94	94		301									I named you after my favorite flower.																						
95	95		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					I hoped this child would be like the prince or knight in the fairy tale, overcoming pain and hardship to deliver a rose to the princess.
