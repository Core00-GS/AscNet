18	18		301								Hassen	There are some items that we were not able to retrieve in time. Commander Nikola would like you to recover them.	1																					
19	19		301								Hassen	Meanwhile, I would like the target facilities to be repaired and reactivated.	1

28	27		301								Pulao	So this operation concerns the Nighter as well.	2																					
29	28		301								Pulao	If the mechanoids prowling around here aren't Corrupted, then they have a place on the Nighter.	2																					
30	29		302								What are you doing here?	30	You really are something	30																				
31	30		301								Pulao	What? No thanks for the one who saved your life?	2																					
32	31		301								Hassen	I heard all about it. I must express my greatest gratitude on Babylonia's behalf.	1																					
33	32		301								Pulao	...When I show you to the database, Mr. President, I hope you'll remember what you promised me.	2																					
34	33		301								Hassen	Of course. 【kuroname】 will make the arrangements.	1																					
35	34		301								Pulao	Huh? So 【kuroname】 is in charge? Well, I guess I'll trust you for now.	2																					
36	35		301								Pulao	I gotta warn you... though what you'll see in the database belongs to Babylonia, you can also find secrets of the Kowloong Chamber of Commerce. So watch what you're watching!	2																					
37	36		301									As Pulao gets more and more animated, her little fists dancing in the air, Hassen wisely speaks up to cut her off.																						
38	37		301								Hassen	To conclude, please work together and perform your duties to the best of your ability.	1																					
39	38		301								Hassen	Because of the sensitive nature of this operation, as well as the complicated status of the Corrupted, I've arranged for Bianca to provide overwatch.	1
