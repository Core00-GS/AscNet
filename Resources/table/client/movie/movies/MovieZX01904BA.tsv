4	4		301			DialogEnable						Chrome follows the Punishing concentration in the direction of footsteps and enters a patch of scorched ruins.																						
5	2001		301									Even though the footsteps begin to fade, Chrome discovers a pack of unusual Hetero-Creatures.																						
6	5		301									Compared to those previously discovered, they more closely resemble an organism that once existed on Earth—scorpions.																						
7	6		301									Right as Chrome discovers the pack of scorpion-like Hetero-Creatures, they, too, discover him and launch an attack.																						
8	7		301									After a quick battle, they let out an ear-piercing screech as Chrome rends them to pieces with his scythe.																						
9	8		301									Once Chrome secures the area, he puts on a pair of protective gloves and takes some samples for analysis.																						
10	9		201							1	500155																							
11	10		301							1	Chrome	There's nothing in our database on these Hetero-Creature. Looks like we've discovered a new species.	1																					
12	11		301								Chrome	...Maybe they've only started to emerge recently.	1																					
13	12		301									Regardless, their mission is clear. Chrome opens the comm link without hesitation and taps Asimov's name.

17	16		301							1	Chrome	Strike Hawk Captain, Chrome, reporting in. I've discovered an unrecorded species of Hetero-Creature.	1																					
18	17		301								Asimov	Send it over.	2																					
19	18		301								Chrome	There's something I wanted to ask you. Do you have a minute?	1																					
20	19		301								Asimov	...That depends.	2																					
21	20		301								Chrome	I wanted to know if this type of Hetero-Creature is a recent phenomenon.	1																					
22	21		301								Asimov	...	2																					
23	22		301								Chrome	Sorry, we can talk about it later if you're busy.	1																					
24	23		301								Asimov	No, I'm just looking at the data you sent over...	2																					
25	24		301								Asimov	Looks like this type of Hetero-Creature has already evolved again in such a short amount of time.	2																					
26	25		301								Asimov	But one thing is for certain—this is a by-product of the Red Tide.	2																					
27	26		301									Hearing this, Chrome's suspicions are confirmed.																						
28	27		301								Chrome	The Red Tide must still be here if Hetero-Creatures are roaming around.	1																					
29	28		301								Asimov	Are you going to continue searching the area?	2																					
30	29		301								Chrome	Yes. Thank you for your help. I'll contact you if we collect any more samples.	1																					
31	30		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Asimov	That won't be necessary. Give them to me when you come back. I've got other work to do.	2

34	33		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Over two hours after Chrome ordered the team to split up—																						
35	34		301									Even with each of the squad members installing a sensor in their respective areas, the fluctuating Punishing Virus concentration proves difficult to uncover any clues.																						
36	35		301									The geology also offers no conclusive evidence except for the Hetero-Creature from earlier.																						
37	36		301									Perhaps this was due to the Longinus Arsenal or someone intentionally covering their tracks.																						
38	37		301									He has suspected that the Red Tide had retreated underground, but two hours of searching has not uncovered anything resembling an underground access point. Further investigations into the surrounding area and the Task Force's investigation into the underground city have been equally fruitless.																						
39	38		301									Maybe there was an easier, albeit crude, method.																						
40	39		201							1	500155																							
41	40		301							1	Chrome	...	1																					
42	41		301									Luckily, Chrome has brought a bag of explosives as powerful as Jitterbombs, just in case.																						
43	42		301									Based on the fluctuating trend of high Punishing concentration, the sensors indicate the closest high concentration zone is 35m from the surface.																						
44	43		301									If they get the positioning wrong and use up all of the explosives, they will have to return to base or call for support.																						
45	44		301								Chrome	We need to reconfirm the positioning of the explosives.	1																					
46	45		202							1					1																			
47	46		301									Given the fluctuating concentration, there are numerous possibilities.																						
48	47		301									If it is only a polluted underground waterway, the real Red Tide would be elsewhere. With everything that needs to be done, hastily requesting support would only add undue burden onto others... The best course of action would be to continue checking.																						
49	48		301									Just as Chrome is considering the matter at hand, Kamui's voice can be heard on the comm link.

57	56		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Chrome rushes over to Kamui. He sees Wanshi kneeling by him, looking at a high concentration reading on the sensor.																						
58	57		201							1	500273																							
59	58		301							1	Wanshi	Hmm... All of the data in this area is the same.	1																					
60	59		301								Wanshi	Not to mention, the location of the high concentration is relatively close to the surface... At least closer than previously measured.	1																					
61	60		202							1					1																			
62	61		301									Realizing that now is their window of opportunity, Chrome explains the plan to the others while checking the data relayed by the nearby sensors.

68	67		301								Wanshi	...Hmm. What could it be?	3																					
69	68		301								Kamui	Maybe the Red Tide is moving underground?	2																					
70	69		301								Chrome	That seems highly likely.	1																					
71	70		301								Chrome	Let's use the explosives to blast open an access point.	1																					
72	71		301								Wanshi	Where should we plant them?	3																					
73	72		301									Looking at his terminal, Wanshi points at several highly concentrated spots on the map with a long, drawn-out yawn.																						
74	73		301								Chrome	We have enough explosives to make four guesses. Let's choose these three locations for the time being. We'll save the rest just in case.	1																					
75	74		301								Chrome	We can increase the blasting depth by cracking the surface. That should give us more of a buffer.	1

79	77		301									Kamui enthusiastically shoulders his greatsword, then begins to hack away at the designated area, leaving a crack that vaguely resembles the letter "A".

81	79		301							1	Wanshi	...By the looks of it... I'm guessing you've been playing "Treasure Hunter"?	1

83	81		301									Kamui tilts his head in confusion. Seems like he has never heard of the game.

90	88		202							1					1

92	90		201							1	500273																							
93	91		301							1	Wanshi	It's a popular sandbox game for VR. It's basically what you're doing right now.	1																					
94	92		301								Wanshi	People use it for exercise or physical therapy... It's—yawn—quite the workout.	1																					
95	93		301								Wanshi	But it's mostly popular because you can dig up tickets that can be redeemed for gold.	1																					
96	94		301								Wanshi	I heard someone won ten tons of gold, then used it to buy their own private island.	1																					
97	95		201							1	1081001	1																						
98	96		301							1	Kamui	No way? I think I'll give it a try after the mission!	1																					
99	97		201							1	500273																							
100	98		301							1	Wanshi	Tough luck. There aren't any rewards left.	1																					
101	99		301								Wanshi	The game was developed by the government to encourage people to work out, so they prepared and paid for the rewards beforehand.	1																					
102	100		301								Wanshi	Now that there aren't any rewards, the game's really died off.	1																					
103	101		201							1	1081001	1																						
104	102		301							1	Kamui	Well, that blows. Why do you know so much about the game, Wanshi?	1																					
105	103		201							1	500273																							
106	104		301							1	Wanshi	A long time ago... There was a sick kid who would just stay in bed all day and refuse treatment. I used it as a way for him to get some exercise. I can lend it to you if you want.	1																					
107	105		201							1	1081001	1																						
108	106		301							1	Kamui	Sweet! Is there co-op? We can play together!	1

111	109		202							1					1																			
112	110		301									Wanshi sets down the fully assembled explosive device, then let's out a long, drawn-out yawn.																						
113	111		201							1	1081001	1																						
114	112		301							1	Kamui	Hey... Was that sick kid you?	1

119	117		202							1					1																			
120	118		301									While Kamui waits for a reply, Wanshi becomes quiet for a moment—falling asleep right where he stands.																						
121	119		201							2	1081001

126	124		202							1	2				1																			
127	125		301									Right at that moment, the trio sees Camu appear nearby, unwilling to come any closer.																						
128	126		201							1	1081001	1																						
129	127		301							1	Kamui	Get over here! We've got enhanced gear this time around!	1

133	131		301							1	Kamui	Well, get used to standing here!	1																					
134	132		201							1	500175																							
135	133		301							1	Camu	But there will be missions without enhanced gear.	1

137	135		202							1					1																			
138	136		301									Camu frowns and turns his back, ignoring Kamui.																						
139	137		301									Suddenly, Chrome receives an anonymous encrypted message on his terminal.

145	143		301									Chrome exams the meta-data for any possible clues, but it has been scrubbed clean.																						
146	144		301								Chrome	There's no way to trace the sender. Our top priority is to find the Red Tide. There's no time to waste.	1																					
147	145		301								Wanshi	We may not be able to trace it, but I'm sure you have a pretty good idea who sent it.	3																					
148	146		301								Chrome	...	1																					
149	147		301									Chrome furrows his eyebrows thinking about the current state of 【kuroname】.																						
150	148		301									Although he has speculated that it might be someone who is looking for Luna, it would be foolish to probe for information this way.																						
151	149		301								Chrome	I think it's someone who is worried about Gray Raven.	1																					
152	150		301								Kamui	Gray Raven? What happened to them?	2																					
153	151		301								Wanshi	...	3																					
154	152		301								Chrome	I heard something from my father before we left.	1																					
155	153		301								Chrome	【kuroname】... not only violated military orders, but is also facing accusations of harboring an Ascendant.	1																					
156	154		301								Kamui	Harboring an Ascendant? How's that possible?	2																					
157	155		301								Wanshi	Does that mean... the commandant's "confined treatment" is just an excuse?	3																					
158	156		301								Chrome	You know about that?	1																					
159	157		301								Chrome	No wonder you haven't gotten much sleep recently.	1																					
160	158		301								Wanshi	I just wanted to help treat 【kuroname】. After all, I still owe the commandant.	3																					
161	159		301								Wanshi	But it didn't take me long to realize it wasn't that simple.	3																					
162	160		301								Wanshi	Gray Raven still doesn't know the whole story.	3																					
163	161		301								Wanshi	If they did, they would rather have their memories checked than let 【kuroname】 be charged.	3																					
164	162		301								Chrome	Therein lies the problem.	1																					
165	163		301								Chrome	Lucia, being closest to 【kuroname】 then, also lost consciousness toward the end. So there isn't any proof to exonerate 【kuroname】.	1																					
166	164		301								Chrome	Unless someone can find the target's whereabouts, they're going to be monitored indefinitely and prohibited from performing missions.	1																					
167	165		301								Kamui	That reminds me. Hassen looked like he had something weighing on his mind this morning.	2																					
168	166		301								Wanshi	...There have been some other oddities as well.	3																					
169	167		301									Seeing that Kamui wants to question Wanshi, Chrome sticks out his hand to end the conversation.																						
170	168		301								Chrome	This is not the place for chit-chat.	1																					
171	169		301								Chrome	Our top priority is the mission. Save it for when we're back in Babylonia.	1
