3	3		301			DialogEnable						Zero-point energy was once the ultimate vision of the future from the people in the Golden Age. Everyone knew about it. Everyone was staring at it.																						
4	4		301									However, the development of zero-point energy was always a mystery. The only foundation of all its research was that it existed. Even experts in the energy sector could only start with trial and error.																						
5	5		301									After countless failures, almost all researchers in the laboratory have lost patience, their spirits broken. Frustration fills every corner of the room.																						
6	6		301									Only one small figure stands before everyone else, boldly but carefully forming different solutions, hoping to recreate what happened to the Atlantis reactor as recorded in the Omega File.																						
7	7		201							1	500494	5																						
8	8		301							1	Karenina	Right... The number of virtual particles detected is normal, which means it's probably the conditions for the output not being able to sustain... ****! It's still not working!	1

11	11		201							1	500495	13																						
12	12		301							1	Teddy	I'm glad you're used to it... It pisses me off every time I see her all energized while I'm dead tired.	1																					
13	13		204							1	1																							
14	14		301								Teddy	But I suppose a fool who won't quit is the only one who deserves to witness success firsthand.	1																					
15	15		301									Teddy dusts off the dirt from her clothes, having been resting on the floor, and stretches before standing up and operating on the terminal.																						
16	16		201							1	500494	5																						
17	17		301							1	Karenina	Hey, you there! Go get a reading of the pressure inside the vacuum chamber and bring me another metal pipe. I smashed the last one...	1

22	22		202							1					1																			
23	23		301									That Kurono Researcher takes a look at Yarha. Although Yarha's role as research director is only nominal, the researchers still technically answer to him.																						
24	24		201							1	500499																							
25	25		301							1	Yarha	We're all after the same thing here. Do as Karenina says.	1																					
26	26		202							1					1																			
27	27		301									Unlike its mysterious and elitist image, scientific researches are boring and fruitless 80% of the time. The celebrated successes are the results of tens of thousands of repeated experiments.																						
28	28		301									Karenina's grandfather had been doing all kinds of ridiculous experiments since she was young. Occasionally—most of the time, they ended in failure.																						
29	29		301									But sometimes—very, very rarely—after an alarming explosion, she would find Kalon covered in soot, grinning and showing his perfect white teeth, walking out the door with a piece of coal in his hands.																						
30	30		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The young Karenina would carefully hold her grandfather's hands, wiping off the topmost layer of dirt to reveal the glistening diamond hiding inside.

34	34		301									Having started working again for who-knows-how-long, the researchers are all startled by Karenina's sudden shout, stopping their work immediately.																						
35	35		204							1	4																							
36	36		301									Karenina is staring at a pencil on her desk until it slowly floats in the air. Even with only one-sixth of Earth's gravity, a pencil would not have levitated on the lunar surface out of nowhere.																						
37	37		301								Karenina	Teddy, take this down! This is it!	1																					
38	38		201							1	500495																							
39	39		301							1	Teddy	Alright, alright. I'm recording it...	1																					
40	40		201							1	500499	19																						
41	41		301							1	Yarha	What is this, Karenina?	1																					
42	42		201							1	500494	13																						
43	43		301							1	Karenina	I hooked up the zero-point reactor with the original engine as its most susceptive detector.	1																					
44	44		301									The zero-point reactor in the lunar base was created as the power source for Babylonia, driving the space-traveling gravitational wave engine.																						
45	45		204							1	1																							
46	46		301								Karenina	This engine was designed for zero-point energy and zero-point energy only. Other energy sources wouldn't work, so it was left here with the reactor.	1																					
47	47		301								Karenina	But that also means it will turn on with the slightest hint of zero-point energy—like this.	1																					
48	48		401							1	36																							
49	49		401							2	897																							
50	50		301									Karenina nods, motioning Teddy to enter the final commands. With a crystal-clear "Ding!" echoing in the laboratory, everyone and everything in the room is suddenly floating in the air as if they are in actual space.

55	55		201							1	500494	1																						
56	56		301								Karenina	Although the engine can only run at 50% of what it can theoretically do this way, without a doubt—the zero-point reactor has restarted.	1

59	59		402					800		2581																								
60	60		301									All the researchers cannot help but cheer. Whether they are from Kurono or the Engineering Force, everyone floating is high-fiving and celebrating with the people around them.																						
61	61		301									Perhaps only now, laughing freely in the absence of gravity, can these people ignore each other's beliefs and factions to enjoy this technological breakthrough as scientific researchers.																						
62	62		201							1	500495	1																						
63	63		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1		Teddy cannot help but grin, either. But her smile quickly fades, as she knows there is a bigger question awaiting them after the zero-point reactor restarts.

75	75		301							1	Yarha	Collins, the Mega-Omega Weapon has been connected to a zero-point energy source.	2																					
76	76		301								Collins	Karen, is the zero-point reactor running properly?	1																					
77	77		301									Karenina watches the Omega Weapon glowing blue upon receiving zero-point energy. Right now, it is only in standby mode.

80	80		301							1	Karenina	Hmph. More proper than any of you...	2																					
81	81		301								Collins	Haha! That's good enough for me. By the way, didn't you refuse to work with us originally?	1																					
82	82		301								Karenina	The Cosmos Technician Union might be neutral, but it doesn't mean we're planning to work with Kurono.	2																					
83	83		301									Cosmos Technician Union's neutrality is part of why the Parliament has chosen Karenina to help Kurono after they agreed to work together.																						
84	84		301								Karenina	We're helping you restart the zero-point reactor only because we need it to produce the Omega Weapon the surface desperately needs right now. Don't overthink it.	2																					
85	85		301								Collins	But Hetero-Creatures and Corrupted won't sit and wait for the Omega Weapon to attack. Humanity needs a more decisive breakthrough to turn things around.	1																					
86	86		204							2	12																							
87	87		301									Collins sends a file to Karenina's terminal. It is the latest project the Parliament and Kurono have agreed to work on together.																						
88	88		204							2	7																							
89	89		301								Karenina	A new specialized frame... In that case, the Omega Weapon can indeed be fully utilized. The base model is made from the data of an agent...	2																					
90	90		204							2	8																							
91	91		301									Karenina glances at the sleeping Luna. Lit by the soft, blue light, Luna's youthful face is the furthest thing Karenina would associate with what Luna is—an agent, the highest form of Ascendant.																						
92	92		301								Collins	Even though the model we built from Luna's data performed better than regular Constructs, it couldn't achieve what the new specialized frame would require to absorb the Punishing Virus.	1																					
93	93		204							2	5																							
94	94		301								Karenina	****! No wonder you gave me that model. You were looking for more data, weren't you?	2																					
95	95		301								Collins	Ha! You can think what you want. I just want you to understand that even the smallest treasure we take from that treasure trove is enough to make such an impact...	1																					
96	96		301									Collins gives Karenina a pat on her shoulder, revealing his usual malicious grin.																						
97	97		301								Collins	As a researcher yourself, aren't you curious about what other secrets are hidden in that trove?	1																					
98	98		401							2	988																							
99	99		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Collins nods at Yarha, and the energy pulse device connected to Luna begins to work, injecting her with energy.

110	110		301								Collins	Luna, that's your name, isn't it... Do you remember me?																						
111	111		301								Luna	...																						
112	112		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Collins	I witnessed your birth on that day, transforming from that lowly Corrupted to the saintly, angelic being you are. I've been hoping to meet you again ever since.

115	115		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		Luna is still expressionless, but her gaze seems to have shifted slightly.																						
116	116		301								Luna	You... are the one who turned me into a Corrupted?	1																					
117	117		201							1	500319	14																						
118	118		301							1	Collins	Of course not. It was an unfortunate accident that you got infected. Or... a necessary sacrifice.	1																					
119	119		301								Collins	Even though Dr. Kalon had greatly increased the success rate of the Construct technology, it was still flawed...	1																					
120	120		201							1	500494	4																						
121	121		301							1	Karenina	"Necessary sacrifice"...	1																					
122	122		201							1	500238																							
123	123		301							1	Luna	Is that so? You think that was an "accident"... but it doesn't matter anymore.	1																					
124	124		301									Luna tries to connect to the Ascension-Network to no avail, as she expected. She has probably been deemed a threat to the network after her actions in City 075...																						
125	125		301									But the Punishing Virus within her has not overtaken her and turned her into a Corrupted, which means she is still an Ascendant for some reason, which surprises her.																						
126	126		301								Luna	Perhaps you're hoping to obtain something from me, humans... but I'm sorry to tell you that I'm no different to your Constructs right now. All I have left is the power to draw in the Punishing Virus.	1																					
127	127		301									Luna raises her bounded right hand slightly. A dark, scarlet light flashes in her palm... causing all the soldiers to raise their weapons.																						
128	128		301								Luna	There is no Punishing Virus here...	1																					
129	129		301									Luna is astounded to find that there is almost no Punishing Virus in the atmosphere except for what is inside her.																						
130	130		201							1	500496	4																						
131	131		301							1	Liszt	Don't be rash. We're on the Moon right now... there is no virus for you Ascendants to absorb. And if you try to run, the Mega-Omega Weapon behind you will activate and destroy all viruses and you in one sweep.	1																					
132	132		201							1	500238																							
133	133		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Luna	I don't plan to run... The person you call Luna is dead. There's no place for me to return to.	1

141	141		301								Luna	But it's pointless. Humanity's end is destined.	1																					
142	142		301									At City 075, Luna chose to oppose the Ascension-Network, siding with her sister and the human her sister trusted despite being humanity's enemy... And now, Luna has nowhere to return as an outcast.																						
143	143		301								Luna	But struggle all you want like that person, humans...	1																					
144	144		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Luna's final words might be uncaring, but it does not sound hostile at all. If anything, there seems to be the faintest hint of hope.
