3	3		301			DialogEnable						White goes first. E2 to E4.																						
4	4		301									Following your command, the Pawn on E2 advances two squares.																						
5	5		301									Chrome slightly frowns and thinks. Then he makes up his mind.																						
6	6		201							1	500309																							
7	7		301							1	Chrome	E7 to E5.	1																					
8	8		202							1					1																			
9	9		301									The black Pawn on the same file thus moves forward as well.																						
10	10		301									The two Pawns meet in the middle of the board.																						
11	11		301									Without hesitation, you issue a new command.																						
12	12		302								F2 to F4.	13																						
13	13		301									With that, the Pawn on the F-file moves next to the Pawn on the E-file, and Chrome's furrowed brows relax.																						
14	14		201							1	500309																							
15	15		301							1	Chrome	King's Gambit?	1																					
16	16		302								(Nod)	17																						
17	17		301									Chrome considers it.																						
18	18		204							1	1																							
19	19		301								Chrome	Classic move.	1																					
20	20		202							1					1																			
21	21		301									As Chrome suggests, the King's Gambit is indeed a classic chess opening, offering the white Pawn on the F-file to lure the black Pawn on the E-file away. If Black takes the gambit, it will expose itself to danger.																						
22	22		301									Chrome has two choices—take the gambit, or refuse it.																						
23	23		201							1	500309																							
24	24		301							1	Chrome	E5 takes F4.	1																					
25	25		301									He has taken it.																						
26	26		302								F1 to C4.	27																						
27	27		301								Chrome	D8 to H4.	1																					
28	28		302								E1 to F1.	29																						
29	29		301								Chrome	B7 to B5.	1																					
30	30		302								C4 takes B5.	31																						
31	31		202							1					1																			
32	32		301									The chess pieces shift and move.																						
33	33		301									Orderly the two of you play, issuing a new command as the other finish making their play.																						
34	34		301									Suddenly, Chrome slows down, going quiet as your piece finishes moving.																						
35	35		201							1	500309																							
36	36		301							1	Chrome	This was my seat.	1																					
37	37		302								This was my seat as well.	38																						
38	38		301								Chrome	Is that so?	1																					
39	39		302								Yeah. If we were from the same year, I'd be sitting in front of you.	40																						
40	40		204							1	1																							
41	41		301									Chrome smiles.																						
42	42		301									The suppressed dullness in the air around him also vanishes right as the corners of his mouth lift.																						
43	43		301									The real Chrome has not shown up until this very moment.																						
44	44		301									You finally say the belated greeting.																						
45	45		302								Good afternoon, Chrome.	46																						
46	46		301								Chrome	Good afternoon, 【kuroname】.	1																					
47	47		302								Nostalgic, isn't it?	48																						
48	48		301								Chrome	It is.	1																					
49	49		302								The selection system in the Gestalt classes, things like that...	50																						
50	50		301								Chrome	Were you also bothered that you would always get picked, being the Chief?	1																					
51	51		302								Of course.	52																						
52	52		301								Chrome	The Gestalt system does adjust the students' probabilities of getting selected by evaluating their attributes, that is true.	1																					
53	53		302								Then you must get picked a lot.	54																						
54	54		202							1					1																			
55	55		301									Chrome closes his eyes.

61	61		301									—Please wait for the system's grading. Please answer the next question.																						
62	62		301									The voices from the past still echo in his ears.																						
63	63		301									—Is that... Langston Smith?																						
64	64		301									—Son of an Administrative Officer, student representative, a true genius... He's even got a pretty face... Ugh, some people really have everything!																						
65	65		301									—What are you inviting him for?																						
66	66		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					—We ain't on the same level with a genius like him.

72	72		302								Are you alright?	73																						
73	73		301									Your voice interrupts Chrome's trip down memory lane.																						
74	74		301									He pauses, with no intention to mask it.																						
75	75		301									He nods, then he shakes his head.																						
76	76		302								Which is it?	77																						
77	77		301								Chrome	I was feeling a little bad, but I'm okay now. Thanks for asking.	1																					
78	78		302								What happened?	79																						
79	79		301								Chrome	...	1																					
80	80		301									He falls silent.

83	83		301									He reaches out to the holographic chessboard this time and picks up the projection of one of the pieces.																						
84	84		301									The Knight on G8 is moved to F6.																						
85	85		301									His attention reverts to the game between you.																						
86	86		301									You follow suit, picking up a piece instead of issuing a command.																						
87	87		301									And now, it is as if the two of you are playing a physical game of chess.																						
88	88		201							1	500309																							
89	89		301							1	Chrome	The person who was supposed to talk before you was me.	1																					
90	90		301									Black Queen moves from H4 to H6.																						
91	91		302								Really?	92																						
92	92		301									White Pawn on the D-file moves from D2 to D3.																						
93	93		301								Chrome	It was canceled in the last minute.	1																					
94	94		301									Black Knight moves from F6 to H5.																						
95	95		302								Why?	96																						
96	96		301									White Knight moves from F3 to F4.																						
97	97		301								Chrome	They didn't think a Construct had the right.	1																					
98	98		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Chrome delivers his line calmly as he gently places the Queen in his hand on G5.
