4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Liv	Commandant, we're on the second step of the program today—combat mode training.	1																					
5	5		302								Combat mode training?	6	You don't have to worry about that as a Support-type, right?	7																				
6	6	8	301								Liv	To learn how to use weapons outside of my Levi-Gun.	1																					
7	7		301								Liv	Lucia mentioned that the more you master, the better it is.	1																					
8	8		301								Liv	Despite having different combat systems in our frames, it doesn't mean that we can utilize them perfectly.	1																					
9	9		301								Liv	Even without Lee pointing it out, I know that I often lose my cool during intense battles.	1																					
10	10		301								Liv	But using my Levi-Gun requires my utmost focus—	1																					
11	11		301								Liv	If I lose control over the Levi-Gun, I'll have to take the time to recalibrate my connection with them.	1																					
12	12		301								Liv	In this case, I think it's essential for me to master other fighting styles to be helpful during reconnection. Like using a sword, for example.	1																					
13	13		301								Liv	And I think you like squad members who can strike the enemies with their blades at melee distance, such as Lucia, right?	1																					
14	14		302								That's true.	15	There's nothing wrong with ranged fighters like you, either.	16																				
15	15	17	301								Liv	So it is...	1																					
16	16		301								Liv	Hmm... Then maybe I should learn to use light weapons like Lee and Bianca?	1																					
17	17		301								Liv	Anyhow, I want to give every kind of weapon a try. Just provide me with the challenges like you did last time, Commandant.	1																					
18	18		301								Liv	Place targets and obstacles in the area for me to destroy.	1																					
19	19		301								Liv	Tell me when to start, Commandant!	1																					
20	20		302								And I'm just observing from the side again?	21	You can do this, Liv!	22																				
21	21		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	(Nods) I won't need to trouble you with this!	1																					
22	22		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	I will do my best!	1
