7	7		301									You walk toward Roland, hoping to see what is inside the box, but he steps sideways and evades you. Reading the book in his hand, he keeps chuckling once in a while.																						
8	8		302								What is it? Show me!	9

11	11		301									Roland takes a step toward you, holding the book in one hand while taking your hand with the other, carefully inspecting it.																						
12	12		301								Roland	"Let me read your palms. I'm very experienced." It is recommended to gently caress that person's hand at this point as you read the palm lines. People are often swayed by that.	1																					
13	13		301									Roland's words leave you speechless for a second. He flips to the next page before looking at you with great admiration while trying his best not to laugh.																						
14	14		301								Roland	"Someone as pretty as you must be going on a date tonight!" Show admiration at this point while suggesting that you are interested in that person's plan for the night. This will often secure you a date.	1																					
15	15		302								Hold on! Stop!	16																						
16	16		301									Roland finally bursts into laughter, closing his book and handing it to you. The title reads, "50 Ways To Talk To Someone You Are Interested In".																						
17	17		301								Roland	I bet even the best actors will break with lines like this.	1																					
18	18		301								Roland	Surely no one expresses their affection with these crappy dialogues, right?	1																					
19	19		302								Even the crappiest line can be sincere if it's the right person.	20																						
20	20		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	Well, then... Do you want to hear what great lines sound like?	1
