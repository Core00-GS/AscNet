80	80		301								Ayla	„Äêkuroname„Äë, I will then do exactly what you said and import the video data of Capriccio into Hamlet...	1																					
81	81		302								What is Capriccio?	82	What do you mean by video data?	84																				
82	82		301								Ayla	It is the name of Selena's new frame. We have completed the M.I.N.D. adaptation, but we didn't manage to deploy it in operations. The development was put on halt for a while.	1

89	89		301								Ayla	...I understand.	1																					
90	90		301								Ayla	But I know all too well why the Remote Connection was banned in the first place. This technology takes a heavy toll on the commandant's memory. If you are connected for too long and extra data gets added to your brain...	1

93	93		301									Ayla remains silent for a moment after being comforted.																						
94	94		301								Ayla	When you enter a play, you become completely immersed. You and the character become one. It is only when the play is drawing to a close will its space start collapsing and revealing the stage's true form. Then, you regain control and slowly remember everything about this reality.	1																					
95	95		302								My only chance is during the ending.	96	I have to seize that moment.	96																				
96	96		301								Ayla	...Yes. During that time, reality and illusions intertwine. When I have verified the possibilities of the Remote Connection, I will track it down using this whale song and the M.I.N.D. connection.	1																					
97	97		301								Ayla	...About the technology, I think I know whom to ask for help.	1
