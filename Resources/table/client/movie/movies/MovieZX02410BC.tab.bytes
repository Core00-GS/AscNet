7	7		302								It is less likely to run into a dragon while at sea than on land, theoretically.	8	Did you just... speak? But it's still daylight.	10																				
8	8		301								Sailor	Yes. It is a lot less likely to run into a dragon at sea.	1																					
9	9	12	301									The sailor whispers.																						
10	10		301								Sailor	Haha.	1																					
11	11		301								Sailor	Observe, find a pattern, and remember it. You...	1

20	20		301								Sailor	In the beginning, the evil dragon appeared on a plain. But then, it started to ravage and destroy the nearby villages. Many people fled out of fear.	1																					
21	21		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Sailor	I followed the crowd and escaped from our village to the capital city. We didn't know what was hunting us. Perhaps it was a dragon, a monster, hunger, or our weary bodies. Or, we were simply out of hope... Those things were like the tides washing against the shore and culling the crowd like sand particles.	1

28	28		301			DialogEnable					Sailor	We arrived at the capital city, but the gate was closed.	1																					
29	29		301								Sailor	We waited at the gate for days. Our supplies were running out. The city guards ignored us as they would ignore the rocks on the streets. Some of us decided to go somewhere else and try our luck. More people came to join us at the gate because they were also scared by the dragon, but none of us was allowed inside.	1																					
30	30		301									The dragon attacked village after village like a sweeping cyclone. It was almost upon the capital city.																						
31	31		301								Sailor	Then, a small group of soldiers went outside the city. We didn't know where they were going.	1																					
32	32		301								Sailor	And then, a larger army arrived in formation. They seemed to be escorting someone or something. I didn't pay much attention to that.	1																					
33	33		301								Sailor	The only thing I cared about was how I could sneak into the city while the ill-tempered guard was busy bowing to the army commander.	1																					
34	34		301								Sailor	It was a mess inside that city. Most people hid in their houses. When I did run into someone on the street and have a conversation with them, they would keep looking up to check if anything was in the sky. People were scared.	1																					
35	35		301								Sailor	Then, some people realized it was a lot less likely to get attacked by the dragon or the monsters while at sea than it was while on land.	1																					
36	36		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Sailor	So, people started building an ark that would save them from extinction. Together, the people tried to fit in on a boat and began drifting at sea. I was one of them.	1
