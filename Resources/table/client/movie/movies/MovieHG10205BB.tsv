16	16		301							1	Lucia	...If I were to undergo training, what would it consist of?	2																					
17	17		301								Lee	Of course it'll include smiling. You're quite expressionless, you know?	1																					
18	18		301								Lucia	Expressionless...?	2																					
19	19		301								Lee	Haven't you noticed? You rarely change your expression. But your emotional expression system should've been turned on long ago with Commandant's permission.	1																					
20	20		301								Lee	Maybe it was forced closed for too long, resulting in you not being able to outwardly express all the emotions you feel inside now, Lucia.	1																					
21	21		301								Lee	Which gives off the impression of being aloof.	1																					
22	22		302							100	You know quite a lot, Lee.	26	Lucia's actually quite friendly.	27

30	30		301								Lucia	I need to smile, is that right?	1																					
31	31		302								Yep, try smiling.	32	Maybe just try smiling casually?	33																				
32	32	34	301								Lucia	...	1																					
33	33		301								Lucia	Ha. Ha. Ha.	1																					
34	34		301								Lucia	...	1																					
35	35		301								Lucia	I tried to do as Commandant instructed, what do you think?	1																					
36	36		302								Lucia... Did you smile?	37	Hm, I had something a bit different in my mind.	37																				
37	37		301								Lucia	I can deal with an emergency during a mission.	1																					
38	38		204							1	3																							
39	39		301								Lucia	But for smiling, even though I never deleted the data, I still can't figure out how to do it.	1
