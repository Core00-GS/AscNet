4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Noan	I heard Commandant Simon said you would be going to another large-scale operation soon. When is it?	1																					
5	5		302								Tomorrow morning.	6																						
6	6		204							1	16																							
7	7		301									Noan peeks at the clock on the bar counter. Its vintage hands are pointing at 17:45.																						
8	8		204							1																								
9	9		301								Noan	Why are you still here then...? Aren't you going to prepare or have a final rest?	1																					
10	10		302								I have a gathering later.	11																						
11	11		204							1	9																							
12	12		301								Noan	Gathering? At this point in time?	1																					
13	13		204							1																								
14	14		302								...More like a social occasion.	15																						
15	15		302								We have been struggling on the battlefield lately. A lot of people have defected.	16																						
16	16		302								So...	17																						
17	17		204							1	10																							
18	18		301								Noan	I see. A lot of senior management staff are also under tremendous pressure, so they need to have meetings, which will likely contain lots of quarrels. They need such social occasions to repair their relationship.	1																					
19	19		302								Something like that.	20																						
20	20		204							1																								
21	21		301								Noan	Is that gathering important to you?	1																					
22	22		302								No, just like you said...	23																						
23	23		302								We just had an overall combat meeting in the morning.	24																						
24	24		302								So all the participating commandants must attend the dinner.	25																						
25	25		301								Noan	But the leaders don't need to prepare tonight, nor do they have to wake up early. Who gives them the right to drag you into this nonsense?	1																					
26	26		302								N-nonsense?	27	This isn't nonsense.	27																				
27	27		301								Noan	No matter what fancy reasons they have, they are just ignoring other people's feelings for their own enjoyment. I call that nonsense.	1																					
28	28		302								But it's hard for me to say no.	29	I don't want to go either.	30																				
29	29	32	301								Noan	You have been working non-stop for so many days. Are you really going to deprive yourself of rest before a dangerous mission?	1																					
30	30		301								Noan	Then don't.	1																					
31	31		204							1	16																							
32	32		301								Noan	If you don't know how to turn them down...	1																					
33	33		204							1	2																							
34	34		301								Noan	How about letting an infamous bad guy hurt you? Then you claim you are not feeling well and can go back to rest.	1																					
35	35		204							1	1																							
36	36		301								Noan	It's not like this has never happened before.	1																					
37	37		301									Noan pushes forward a drink that he just made.																						
38	38		301								Noan	Right?	1																					
39	39		302								...	40																						
40	40		301									After a prolonged period of thinking, the commandant finally picks up the cup and takes a couple of sips.																						
41	41		301									Holding the cup, the commandant sits back at the desk and starts sending messages on the terminal.																						
42	42		301									Noan did not ask about the content of the messages, but he knows they will not be easy to deal with just from the frown on the human's face.																						
43	43		301									Ten minutes later, the commandant puts away the terminal and takes another sip before walking over.																						
44	44		302								Noan.	45	Shrek.	47																				
45	45		204							1	1																							
46	46		301								Noan	Hmm?	1																					
47	47		301								Noan	What is it?	1																					
48	48		302								Let's run away.	49																						
49	49		204							1	2																							
50	50		301									He closes his eyes and chuckles.																						
51	51		204							1	1																							
52	52		301								Noan	Thanks. But who is going to be responsible for your sick leave if I run away?	1																					
53	53		301								Noan	I am tagged. There is surveillance everywhere. No matter where I go, they will find us.	1																					
54	54		301								Noan	You should go back and have some rest. I can walk you to the lounge if you need me to.	1																					
55	55		302								They will be worried if I take sick leave and go back to the lounge.	56																						
56	56		301								Noan	Then just go to a place you like and chill out.	1																					
57	57		302								Can't I just stay here?	58																						
58	58		301								Noan	They are coming to get the bad guy very soon, and you will still be forced to take a break.	1																					
59	59		301								Noan	Maybe they will take you directly to Star of Life.	1																					
60	60		302								But I can't leave you alone...	61																						
61	61		302								And let you face all of that.	62																						
62	62		301								Noan	I still have to face it if I run away with you.	1																					
63	63		302								In that case, I will become an accomplice.	64																						
64	64		302								And I will share half of your problems.	65																						
65	65		302								Isn't that what you said?	66																						
66	66		204							1	9																							
67	67		301								Noan	...	1																					
68	68		204							1	2																							
69	69		301								Noan	...You are so...	1																					
70	70		302								It's just that...	71																						
71	71		302								Sorry, I never thought there would be a tag on you.	72																						
72	72		302								If that's the case...	73																						
73	73		204							1	1																							
74	74		301								Noan	If that's the caseБ─■	1																					
75	75		301									He opens his arms and reaches out both hands over the counter.																						
76	76		301								Noan	The tag is right on my wrist. Are you going to disarm it?	1																					
77	77		301									Noan sounds like he is just teasing, as if he is not serious and prepared to be rejected.																						
78	78		302								...	79																						
79	79		302								I don't have the authority.	80																						
80	80		301								Noan	But you know who has.	1																					
81	81		302								Simon?	82	Asimov?	82																				
82	82		301									He nods.																						
83	83		302								...	84																						
84	84		204							1	11																							
85	85		301								Noan	Shouldn't you turn me down immediately?	1																					
86	86		301								Noan	Are you seriously thinking about whether you can trust me?	1																					
87	87		302								I...	88	I was really thinking about it.	88																				
88	88		301								Noan	Do you trust that I will not sneak into a shuttle, and contact the Ascendants when I land? I can pass the filtering and become mightier than ever, you know?	1																					
89	89		302								...	90																						
90	90		302								If you really have that plan, you wouldn't have come back with me.	91																						
91	91		301								Noan	I was badly wounded and had no choice. I either came with you, or got killed by youБ─■at least that's what the doubters always think.	1																					
92	92		302								I don't think so.	93																						
93	93		301								Noan	Then...	1																					
94	94		301									He waves his hand. Still, he looks like he is mocking himself.																						
95	95		301								Noan	I just happen to know a route without surveillance. I can take you with me.	1																					
96	96		302								Did you really study the surveillance system?	97																						
97	97		301								Noan	Yeah. I discovered it by accident though.	1																					
98	98		301								Noan	I really sound like a defector now, don't I? Do you still believe me?	1																					
99	99		302								...	100																						
100	100		301									After a moment of hesitation, the human picks up the terminal again.																						
101	101		204							1																								
102	102		301									After a lot of communications and procedures, the ID card of Gray Raven Commandant finally has finally been granted authority. The commandant flashes the card over Noan's wrist.																						
103	103		401						100	2	897																							
104	104		402							897																								
105	105		301									Б─■Beep.																						
106	106		301									The closely attached wrist band falls off his artificial skin onto the bar counter.																						
107	107		302								I only got six hours for you.	108																						
108	108		302								After six hours... You still need to put it on.	109																						
109	109		301								Noan	More than enough. I'll be back soon.																						
110	110		301								Noan	...Thank you for believing in me.	1																					
111	111		301									He moves the wrist, walks out from the bar counter, and reaches out his unshackled hand to the human in front.

116	116		301			DialogEnable						Two of them run across the square into a long, narrow safety path.																						
117	117		201							1	500506																							
118	118		301							1	Noan	Stay close to the wall. Follow me.	1																					
119	119		301								Noan	Actually, there is still surveillance here. But it has a blind spot.	1																					
120	120		302								How did you ever find that?	121																						
121	121		301								Noan	It's a secret. Can I not tell you?	1																					
122	122		302								No.	123	But I already trusted you.	123																				
123	123		301								Noan	I'm actually good at finding the blind spots of surveillance.	1																					
124	124		204							1	2																							
125	125		301								Noan	When I was a child, I had a secret base. It was a warehouse and I had to avoid the surveillance to get in.	1																					
126	126		302								Secret base?	127																						
127	127		204							1	1																							
128	128		301								Noan	Yeah, it was a warehouse of books. The books inside are all for sale, but nobody would find out I am reading them as long as I don't damage them.	1

133	133		301									As they talk, they have already gone through the path into a deserted bridge in Zone Z.																						
134	134		301								Noan	Once we are here, nobody will find out.	1																					
135	135		301								Noan	Sit on the stairs and take a break.	1																					
136	136		302								OK	137																						
137	137		301									The human nods and sits next to Noan.																						
138	138		301									Noan has not said anything. He just takes out a book he brought from the library and starts reading.																						
139	139		301									Nobody will ever visit here. The lighting and temperature control system stopped functioning long ago. Only the dim emergency light is blinking in the cold air.																						
140	140		302								Are you going to read a book here?	141																						
141	141		301								Noan	I'd love to talk to you, but I got you here to let you rest.	1																					
142	142		301								Noan	Wouldn't it defeat the purpose if I keep talking?	1																					
143	143		302								...	144																						
144	144		301								Noan	If you still can't fall asleep, at least you can empty your head.	1																					
145	145		204							1	1																							
146	146		301								Noan	Rest assured that I will stay here.	1																					
147	147		301								Noan	I'll send you back when you feel a bit better.	1																					
148	148		302								But it's a little cold here.	149	Alright.	155																				
149	149		301								Noan	Sorry, but I didn't bring any coat or blanket either. Would you like to sit closer?	1																					
150	150		302								(Nod)	151																						
151	151		301								Noan	Come this way...	1																					
152	152		301									With the book in one hand, he pulls the cape with the other and puts it over the commandant while still looking at his book.																						
153	153		301									His action is very natural, as if he is calming down a good friend or child.																						
154	154		301								Noan	You should rest now.	1																					
155	155		301									Looking at the distant stars, the human slowly calms down.																						
156	156		301									Noan also remains calm like the empty bridge.																						
157	157		301									Time slowly goes by...																						
158	158		301									He finishes half the book and looks up, only to find the human has fallen asleep.																						
159	159		301								Noan	...	1																					
160	160		301								Noan	You really fell asleep...	1																					
161	161		301								Noan	...What a reckless act.	1																					
162	162		301								Noan	Are you just that type of person who easily trusts others, or do you really find me trustworthy...?	1																					
163	163		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					His soft, gentle voice melts in the calm breaths.
