8	6		301									I knew there were two teams, but I didn't expect to meet them so early outside the Demon General's Castle.																						
9	7		301								Lucia	I can answer you first. We came here because our clues showed that Liv once visited this place.	1																					
10	2003		302								Wasn't Liv taken by the Demon King?	8	Is Liv inside this castle?	9																				
11	8	10	301								Lucia	The Demon King... What's going on?	1																					
12	9	10	301								Lucia	We aren't sure either, but she's definitely been around here.	1																					
13	10		301									Lucia's answer sounded slightly off, as if they were playing a different game.

18	12		301								Kamui	No, we didn't. Liv was lost before we started the game, so we've been looking for her.	2																					
19	13		301								Camu	Just like I thought...	1																					
20	14		301								Kamui	You must have been to the King's palace. We heard many rumors on the way, like "the King's minions", and "evil heroes."	2

33	18		301							1	Kamui	Commandant, what exactly did the King tell you? Could you share with us?	1

37	19		301							1	Lee	I see. So the King NPC looked like Hassen, and he called Liv the Princess. She was taken by the Demon King to his castle.	2																					
38	20		301								Lucia	The Goddess' artifact, and what the Demon General said before he was defeated... They all match what we know.	3																					
39	21		301								Kamui	So that King is a bad guy, isn't he?	1

44	2016		201							2	500173		400																					
45	23		301							1	Lee	But from what Commandant said, the King wanted the heroes to collect the artifact for him to open the path to the Demon King's Castle.	2																					
46	24		301								Lee	What could Liv's role possibly be...	2																					
47	2017		201							2	500166		400																					
48	25		301							1	Lucia	True... But he definitely needs Liv for something else, otherwise he wouldn't be putting her in the quest.	2																					
49	26		301									After Lee and Lucia's analysis, we were able to confirm two key things in the King's plan.																						
50	27		301									The first was to open the gate of the Demon King's Castle, and the second was Liv.																						
51	28		301								Lucia	We only need to collect the artifact to open the Demon King's Castle. But we don't know anything about Liv's situation yet, so we better take caution.	2																					
52	29		301								Vera	Why take caution? Just follow the quest tips.	1																					
53	30		301								Lucia	But the King could have an evil plan up his sleeve. If we don't stop him, both the humans and Demons could suffer greatly.	2																					
54	31		301								Vera	So what? This is just a game. I couldn't care less about their lives.	1																					
55	32		301								Lucia	You may be right, Vera. But I will not give up anyone.	2																					
56	33		301								Vera	...	1																					
57	34		301								Vera	You have become even more disgusting after the memory loss.	1

60	35		301							1		After the quarrel, Vera pulled her weapon out from the ground and walked directly toward the Demon General's Castle, followed by Camu and Karenina.																						
61	36		301								Lucia	Commandant, if you are going into the castle, could you protect Liv if you happen to see her inside?		1																				
62	2020		302								Of course.	37	What about you?	38																				
63	37	2021	301								Lucia	Thank you, Commandant.	1																					
64	38	2021	301								Lucia	The info we collected didn't show Liv entering the building, so we will continue searching around here.	1																					
65	2021		201							1	500180																							
66	39		301							1	Karenina	Hurry up, Gray Raven! Don't forget you are in our team!	1

73	42		301								Lee	Lucia, why did you let them take Commandant? We should keep as much strength as we can.	2																					
74	43		301								Lucia	Because the enemy wanted us, not the other team of heroes.	1																					
75	44		301								Lee	Oh, this part of you has never changed... Kamui, let's prepare for battle.	2																					
76	45		301								Kamui	Understood!	3																					
77	46		301									Lucia unsheathed her blade right after Commandant left. Kamui and Lee also braced themselves as a man walked out of a hidden corner.
