4	4		301									The numerous scars on your body are taking their toll on you. If this goes on, you will lose your sanity.																						
5	5		301									How did you manage to maintain your most basic form? The flickering light could no longer gather its thoughts to ponder such a question.																						
6	6		301									In the memories that you have collected, one thing is for sure... You are reliving Liv's past.																						
7	7		301									She too was once lost in the sea of memories and death, struggling, pierced, and torn apart.																						
8	8		302								...Liv.	9																						
9	9		302								Liv...	10																						
10	10		302								...	11																						
11	11		301									You have lost count of how many times you call her.																						
12	12		301									In this muddy torrent, every effort you make will end up in vain.																						
13	13		301									And things stay that way for a long, long time.																						
14	14		301									Following the muddy torrent of data, you drift toward the end of the world... until you feel the wind that carries a soft singing voice.																						
15	15		301									It is supposed to be a lullaby, but instead, it awakens those who lie dormant.																						
16	16		301									It is supposed to be a song sung in a cage, but instead, it delivers the key of freedom to the imprisoned.																						
17	17		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Following the singing voice to its source, you realize this empty world is slowly growing realistic. The souls drifting in chaos have finally found a safe haven to rest their weary minds.

22	22		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The summer breeze comes through the window and lifts the silk curtain, as warm as the day you left.																						
23	23		301									The bird Liv helped save remains in its cage silently, trying not to show its fear.																						
24	24		301									No matter how the wind blows on this night, it no longer dares spread its wings and fly again.																						
25	25		301									The house you once shared with your companions is as you remember it to be.																						
26	26		301									Raindrops fall on the exterior walls and the blossoming flowers on the windowsill, which silently remember how many days the girl has spent next to the window, waiting.																						
27	27		301									Those days that she dreams about have long turned into a cage of loneliness, but still, she remains here like a lantern forgotten in an abandoned house.																						
28	28		301									...She is just like the bird in the cage.																						
29	29		301									The nightmare is never gone. She just covers it up with her own dream.																						
30	30		302								...	31																						
31	31		301									The memories of awakening to reality and the echoes once lingering in the void are calling to you.																						
32	32		301									It is only by destroying her dream will the bird in the cage be able to return to its previous habitat.																						
33	33		301									But is that really something you should do?																						
34	34		301									You've been living in her dream for a decade, and every day is full of peace and love.																						
35	35		301									This is the world she longs for. The world that everyone wants to see. And one day in the future, it will become a reality.																						
36	36		301									But this future is far away and out of reach. Before you have a chance to get there, thousands of lives will be buried in the snow of winter.																						
37	37		301									If things are destined to end up in ruins, why not embrace this beautiful dream and stay away from the cruel reality?																						
38	38		302								But this is not my choice to make.	39																						
39	39		301									Before you are presented with this opportunity, countless people have to choose between life and death.																						
40	40		301									To realize this peaceful dream, they light up the dark and clear a way leading to that future.																						
41	41		302								If we give up now, their effort will go to waste.																							
42	42		301									This is Liv's dream. It is all the more reason to believe that she will not give it up.

47	48		301									Upon hearing someone knocking on the door, the girl quickly comes down from upstairs as fast as a cat running in the moonlight. She opens the door and jumps into the arms of the person she has long awaited.																						
48	49		302								Sorry that I kept you waiting.	50																						
49	50		301								Liv	It's okay... I'm just glad you are back now.	1																					
50	51		301									She is slightly trembling, fearing that this phantom will vanish if she hugs too hard.																						
51	52		302								I'm right here.	53	(Hug Liv)	53																				
52	53		301								Liv	Yes... Commandant...	1

57	58		301								Liv	I have always known.	1																					
58	59		301									With her eyes watering, the girl bids farewell first.																						
59	60		301								Liv	...This is but a remaining dream left in my M.I.N.D.	1																					
60	61		301								Liv	And you have come to collect my M.I.N.D. shards. That's why you are here, Commandant.	1																					
61	62		301								Liv	You are m... our Commandant.	1																					
62	63		301									This time, she addresses you by your title, but she cannot keep her emotions under control.																						
63	64		301									...And she doesn't have to anymore.																						
64	65		301								Liv	To find you and everyone else, I've been searching everywhere in this world.	1																					
65	66		301								Liv	Though it took me a lot of time, I finally... found myself.	1																					
66	67		301									You look to where Liv is looking and find the white bird in the cage still dancing with the wind.	1																					
67	68		302								...Is it that bird?	69																						
68	69		301								Liv	Yes... That bird is my M.I.N.D. shard.	1																					
69	70		302								...Then you are...?	71																						
70	71		301									Before falling into her dream, you have experienced many such illusionary realms in search of her shards. This is because Asimov used Spear of F.O.S. to visualize data.																						
71	72		301									Usually, Liv's M.I.N.D. shards are represented in her image as they wander where the memories intertwine.																						
72	73		301								Liv	...I am just a dream left in the M.I.N.D. I'm an entity imagined by that white bird.	1																					
73	74		301								Liv	Do you remember what happened before you came here?	1

78	80		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You were searching for the sixth M.I.N.D. shard... And you thought it was what happened in the last memory.																						
79	81		301									When humanity is overwhelmed by the horde of Hetero-Creatures and the Corrupted, no matter how they struggle, the pathetic effort won't be enough for them to touch the light in the sky.																						
80	82		302								Liv!	83																						
81	83		301									The shout is lost in the crowd and unable to reach the girl who has vanished into the light.																						
82	84		301									Just like a bird that voluntarily stays in its cage, so long as the Empyrea frame can grant her the strength to change and save things, no matter how much pain that cage brings, Liv will face it.																						
83	85		301									Perhaps if you stay here, one day you will have the chance to see her?																						
84	86		301									But the enemies coming from behind do not think so.																						
85	87		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Upon noticing this, blood starts dripping down from where your head once suffered a trauma. The unbearable pain pulls at your Mind Beacon and plunges it into the ocean of chaos and corruption.

111	113		301									Before everything falls apart, Liv puts your hands on her chest. You can still feel the warmth of her teardrops in your palm.																						
112	114		301								Liv	And it is time you leave.	1																					
113	115		302								What about you?	116

118	120		301									The white bird finally opens its cage and puts a golden key in Liv's hand, but then it turns around and lands on the shoulder of the person who is about to travel far.																						
119	121		301								Liv	Farewell, Commandant. I'm sure we will meet again.	1																					
120	122		301								Liv	Even though reality is filled with challenges and pain, so long as you have friends fighting alongside you, this dream will come true someday in the future.	1																					
121	123		301								Liv	I<//DREAM> will be waiting for you in the future.	1																					
122	124		301									The girl is shedding tears but smiling, waving goodbye to the light of her life.
