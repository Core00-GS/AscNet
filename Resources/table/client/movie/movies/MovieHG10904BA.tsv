3	3		301			DialogEnable						The next day, Ayla calls you to her studio.																						
4	4		301									For some reason, you are blindfolded as you enter the studio.																						
5	5		301								Ayla	Don't take off your blindfold just yet.																						
6	6		301									Ella pushes you into a chair.																						
7	7		301									It seems like you have been moving for some time, but you get this sneaking suspicion that you are moving in circles.																						
8	8		301								Ayla	Hmm... If that's the case...																						
9	9		301									You hear the electric buzzing of a projector turning on.																						
10	10		301								Ayla	Hmm... This isn't ideal...																						
11	11		301									You hear the clicking of a button.																						
12	12		301								Ayla	Just a few minor adjustments... Annnnd that should do it.																						
13	13		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Ayla	Alright, you can take off your blindfold.

15	15		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Is this... the bridge in Babylonia?																						
16	16		301									You pushed me all the way here?																						
17	17		301									Ayla wants to respond when the comms on your headset rings.

22	22		301								Lucia	I didn't see you this morning. Everything okay?	1																					
23	23		302								You could say that.	24																						
24	24		301								Lucia	Well, when you finish up, come to the bridge. Celica said...	1

28	28		301									Am I not already at the bridge?																						
29	29		301									Wait, no. Seems like the night sky is a bit blurry.																						
30	30		302								(Extend hand to feel it)	31																						
31	31		301									Feels like... a wall.																						
32	32		301									There appears to be a wall about half a meter in front of you.

34	34		301							1	Ayla	Spacial immersion seems good enough, but the distance isn't fooling anyone...	1

38	38		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Ella toggles her personal terminal, and a white wall appears in front of her.																						
39	39		301									Seems like this was parallax photography projected on the wall to create a sense of remote reality.

41	41		301							1	Ayla	If that's the case...	1																					
42	42		301								Ayla	It seems to work in principle.	1																					
43	43		301								Ayla	Next up... I won't need to bother you anymore.	1																					
44	44		302								...?	45																						
45	45		301								Ayla	After all, how to frame the "question," that is left to the creator...	1
