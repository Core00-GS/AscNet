40	40		301								Nanami	But Commandant is Nanami's favorite! The commandant has taught Nanami so—many—things. I can put in a good word if you want a meet-and-greet, but Nanami will always be the best and cutest one in the commandant's heart.	1																					
41	41		201							1	500470			-350	600

46	46		301							1	Sniper	You know everything about him already. You have access to my databank.	1																					
47	47		301								Sniper	I do not know much about my maker. I only know that the city I was stationed in was a base for humans, and he had other human companions.	1																					
48	48		301								Sniper	He has, on occasions, mentioned something about...	1																					
49	49		301								Sniper	...How humanity's situation became extremely difficult... due to the Ever-Winter and the Badlands.	1																					
50	50		201							1	500475																							
51	51		301							1	Nanami	I'm asking you what you think of your human. That I can't know from your databank.	1																					
52	52		301								Nanami	And I've been investigating what Ever-Winter and Badlands are... Are they new viruses?	1																					
53	53		301								Nanami	We haven't encountered many Corrupted on our way... Nanami's so bored that even the Corrupted in her memories is getting lovelier.	1

62	62		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
63	63		301							1	Sniper	No power can solve a global climate issue like this. If humans could fix it, they would be foolish not to have fixed it already.	1																					
64	64		301									Sniper-PK43 speaks flatly.																						
65	65		301								Sniper	Those mechanoids found no one where they came from. Mutated animals are around us, and the only signs of humans in those buildings are their bodies. Perhaps humanity is extinct. Why do you think you can see them again?	1																					
66	66		201							1	500475																							
67	67		301							1	Nanami	...Nanami hasn't been ignoring them.	1

84	84		301									The energetic Nanami rushes away with her arms wide open. Not far in the distance are some contraptions buried in snow, their functions unidentifiable.																						
85	85		301									Arriving at one of the snow piles, Nanami eagerly wipes away the snow to reveal a colorful seesaw underneath.																						
86	86		201							1	500473

93	93		301							1	Sniper	It is true that I never saw a place like this. Regardless, it is useless now. No children will be playing here anymore.	1																					
94	94		201							1	500473																							
95	95		301							1	Nanami	Maybe it's because they can't recognize it! I've decided to build a snowman here to make this place looks more like a park!	1

118	118		301								Nanami	The smaller snowman is Snipey's soldier friend. Nanami has given this sweet boy a flower.																						
119	119		301								Sniper	He was actually a grown man...																						
120	120		301								Nanami	Nanami knows that you must miss your friend... like how I miss mine.
