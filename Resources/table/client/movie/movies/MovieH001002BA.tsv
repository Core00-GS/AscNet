8	8		202							1					1																			
9	9		301									You gently lift your head to see Lucia looking at you nervously.																						
10	10		301									Based on the soreness of your chest, you infer that you were just given first aid.																						
11	11		301									Liv is always in charge of medical work. Lucia rarely has to handle treatment.																						
12	12		301									But as a Construct, first aid is obviously included in her intensive training.																						
13	13		302								Lucia...	14	(Sit up)	16																				
14	14		201							1	500347																							
15	15	17	301							1	Lucia	I'm here.	1																					
16	16		201							1	500347																							
17	17		301							1	Lucia	Commandant, how are you feeling?	1																					
18	18		302								I'm fine.	19	Cough...	19																				
19	19		301								Lucia	You almost drowned. Now you run the risk of a chest infection, but I can't examine you in a place like this. If only Liv were here...	1																					
20	20		302								Where are we?	21																						
21	21		301									Looking around, you see the ruins of recreational facilities scattered on the beach.																						
22	22		301								Lucia	It resembles Venus Splash Park, but that's over 180 kilometers away...	1																					
23	23		301								Lucia	I suspect that it once belonged to Venus Splash Park. Looks like it served the same function as an island resort.	1																					
24	24		302								Looks like we're on an uninhabited island.	25																						
25	25		301								Lucia	Perhaps it's not really "uninhabited." Judging from the current Punishing Virus concentration, it's highly possible that there are still mechanoids and supplies on the island. Maybe Scavengers live here?	1																					
26	26		302								Let's contact the others first.	27																						
27	27		301								Lucia	I already tried contacting Liv and Lee, but there was no reply.	1																					
28	28		301								Lucia	The signal's too weak here. And our terminals were damaged in the riptide...	1																					
29	29		301								Lucia	We need to find a ride out of here and rendezvous with the others ASAP.	1																					
30	30		302								Alright. Let's split up.	31																						
31	31		301								Lucia	No. Leave it to me.	1																					
32	32		301								Lucia	The Punishing Virus concentration of the area up ahead is well within safety range. You can wait for me there.	1																					
33	33		302								I want to help, too.	34	I'll leave it to you then.	36																				
34	34		301								Lucia	You just recovered. You should rest up.	1																					
35	35	37	301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	You can count on me.	1

39	39		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Leaving the soft sandy beach, you walk to the center of the island by yourself amid the crashing sound of the waves.																						
40	40		301									The first thing you see is a spacious, abandoned plaza, followed by amusement park facilities long out of service, awaiting visitors in the mist. Both sides of the road are lined with machinery and collapsed buildings.																						
41	41		301									You have not been inspecting the deserted plaza for long before Lucia returns with a large bag of collected parts.																						
42	42		301									...And two live fish in hand.																						
43	43		201							1	500347																							
44	44		301							1	Lucia	Sorry, Commandant. I didn't find a boat for us to use or repair.	1																					
45	45		301								Lucia	But we should be able to build a boat out of the surrounding materials. I also brought back some parts that can be used to build an engine.	1																					
46	46		301									Lucia ignores the two flopping fish. She just looks out in the direction of the surf.																						
47	47		301								Lucia	I'm no mechanic, but I should be able to build a boat given enough time.	1																					
48	48		302								You want to... build a boat?	49																						
49	49		301									You hesitate then nod to Lucia, trustingly. At the same time, you ponder another issue.																						
50	50		302								What about the Corrupted in the sea?	51																						
51	51		301								Lucia	You're right. They'll be our biggest threat.	1																					
52	52		301									She clutches the fish tightly.																						
53	53		301								Lucia	Even though there aren't any blueprints or proper tools here, I'm confident we can build a boat to cross the sea. But we'll have no way of defending their attack.	1																					
54	54		302								Let's keep looking.	55																						
55	55		301								Lucia	Okay.	1																					
56	56		301								Lucia	The Punishing Virus concentration is lower nearby. I saw some mechanoids that still haven't been corrupted maintaining the buildings here.	1																					
57	57		301								Lucia	But that doesn't mean there aren't hidden pockets with high Punishing Virus concentration.	1																					
58	58		301									As soon as Lucia says that, a small group of robots with cleaning tools walk down the corridor.	1																					
59	59		302								Um...	60																						
60	60		301								Lucia	What's wrong?	1																					
61	61		302								What's with the fish...?	62																						
62	62		301								Lucia	I couldn't find that many supplies around here, but the life support systems seem to be well-maintained.	1																					
63	63		301								Lucia	It's getting late, Commandant. You need to rest up and regain your strength.	1																					
64	64		301								Lucia	That's why I caught you some fish. I'll get them ready for you to eat.	1																					
65	65		302								You're planning on cooking all by yourself?	66	Need help? I know a thing or two about cooking.	67																				
66	66	69	301								Lucia	Yes.	1																					
67	67		301								Lucia	You need to rest, Commandant. We've got a tough road ahead of us.	1																					
68	68		202							1					1																			
69	69		301									Lucia looks around the plaza, holding the fish that have gradually lost their strength, and points down a brick path nearby.																						
70	70		201							1	500347																							
71	71		301							1	Lucia	There's an abandoned park over there. It has the lowest Punishing Virus concentration I could find.	1																					
72	72		301								Lucia	Let's go to the empty library right behind it.	1																					
73	73		301								Lucia	There's an abandoned cafe in it, which should have some appliances for cooking food.	1																					
74	74		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				...Let's go.	75

76	76		202							1					1																			
77	77		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Reaching the library entrance, you look around to see that the place is surprisingly well-kept except for a few remnants of destruction. What happened to this island?																						
78	78		302								What's with these ruins?	79																						
79	79		201							1	500347																							
80	80		301							1	Lucia	This area must have had frequent fighting before it was abandoned altogether.	1																					
81	81		301								Lucia	I saw a bunch of similar ruins while looking for parts.	1																					
82	82		301								Lucia	Also... there were signs of humans, such as graffiti and messages carved into the ruins.	1																					
83	83		302								Looks like they didn't evacuate in a hurry.	84																						
84	84		301								Lucia	You mean people stayed here for a while before leaving these markings?	1																					
85	85		302								Who knows? Maybe there are still survivors here.	86																						
86	86		301								Lucia	But I didn't see any signs of life.	1																					
87	87		302								Maybe they're hiding.	88																						
88	88		301								Lucia	It's possible. I'll investigate more of the island later. If I can find someone to speak to, maybe we can get some intel that'll help us get off this island ASAP.	1																					
89	89		301								Lucia	But right now, our main priority is to get your strength up, Commandant.	1																					
90	90		301									Lucia walks straight into the kitchen at the back of the abandoned coffee shop. She quickly cleans the counter and places the two dying fish on it.																						
91	1190		204							1	1																							
92	91		301								Lucia	The appliances are still operational, and there are also some condiments left over. Looks like this was the work of those robots...	1

94	1193		204							1																								
95	93		301								Lucia	Yes.	1																					
96	94		301								Lucia	They'll continue to do their scheduled work until they receive orders otherwise.	1																					
97	95		202							1					1																			
98	96		301									Lucia looks down and searches through the equipment and utensils stored within the kitchen.																						
99	97		301									You have known about Lucia's cooking "skills" for quite some time, but you have never witnessed her in action.																						
100	98		301									You are overcome with curiosity given such a rare opportunity while your survival instinct kicks in at the same time.																						
101	99		201							1	500347																							
102	100		301							1	Lucia	Alright, it's showtime.	1																					
103	101		302								Showtime?	102	...	103																				
104	102		301								Lucia	Time for me and the fish to do battle.	1																					
105	103		301								Lucia	Take a step back, Commandant. Keep a safe distance.	1																					
106	104		302								A safe distance?	105																						
107	105		301									Right as you ask, Lucia unsheathes her blade.																						
108	106		302								...W-wait!	107																						
109	107		301								Lucia	Is there something you wish to say?	1																					
110	108		302								You're going to use your katana to cut the fish?	109																						
111	109		301								Lucia	Of course. It's the weapon I'm most familiar with.	1																					
112	110		301									Even though this goes against everything you know about cooking, you are also curious to see how she plans on going about it.																						
113	111		302								(Don't stop her)	112	You should use a proper kitchen knife...	143																				
114	112		202							1					1

142	140		301									...Is that why you wanted me to stand a safe distance away?																						
143	141		301									Returning to your senses, you notice that the surrounding counter has been completely destroyed in the flurry of swings from her katana. Only the small area where the fish is placed remains intact.																						
144	142	193	301									You finally understand why you received such a large bill for kitchen repairs...

262	262		301									You walk up next to Lucia and carefully examine the dozens of bottles, cans and bags she just opened.																						
263	263		301									The content include salt, oyster sauce, red wine, coffee, saccharin, white vinegar, bean flour, ungrounded black pepper... Among the many other ingredients, there is even a bag of yeast.																						
264	264		301									Even though the Golden Age had revolutionized food storage, which greatly extended the shelf life of products, you smell a subtle but concerning odor coming from the containers.																						
265	265		301									After repeated inspection, a select few ingredients were added to the fish soup.

274	274		301									You calmly pick up your spoon and taste the fish soup...																						
275	275		301									Given the circumstances, it's not delicious by any means. However, it's a warm and hearty soup for someone half-starved and stuck on a deserted island.

294	292		301								Lucia	Yes.	1																					
295	293		302								Why?	294																						
296	294		301								Lucia	Because they make food taste better.	1																					
297	295		302								That's right.	296																						
298	296		301								Lucia	So I thought adding more would make it taste even better.	1																					
299	297		302								Hahahahaha!	298	What makes you think that?	299																				
300	298	300	301								Lucia	Sorry... Is something the matter, Commandant?	1																					
301	299		301									Instead of laughing, perhaps it would have been better to ask her why she thought that way.																						
302	300		301								Lucia	...Most of what I remember about cooking is from my childhood.	1																					
303	301		301								Lucia	If you want to keep living, you can't be a picky eater.	1																					
304	302		301								Lucia	Especially when I was by myself for the first time with nowhere to go. I was too young to distinguish between condiments.	1																					
305	303		301								Lucia	Before I could use a dagger, I could barely find canned food or hardtack. Most of the food I got was expired or dirty. Sometimes it was just plants. Other times, it was just dirt.	1																					
306	304		301								Lucia	For people at that time, condiments were hard to come by. Even a pinch of salt could make something like leaves easier to swallow.	1																					
307	305		301								Lucia	Looking back... When I was wandering with nowhere to go, I never had enough supplies to experiment with. I never had enough condiments to make food taste bad. Now I'm afraid to put in too little.	1																					
308	306		301								Lucia	After becoming a Construct and seeing the fully stocked kitchen in Babylonia, I guess I accidentally... went a bit overboard with the condiments and ingredients.	1																					
309	307		301								Lucia	After that, no one even wants me going into the kitchen. So I haven't had much of an opportunity to improve.	1																					
310	999		204							1	2

317	314		301									You hug the slightly nervous Lucia, gently stroking her long hair and kindly patting her on the back.

343	339		301								Lucia	Very well. Someone needs to be on guard anyway.	1																					
344	340		302								How about you read a book?	341																						
345	341		301								Lucia	...A book?	1																					
346	342		301									She looks around at the sea of books, puzzled.																						
347	343		302								You don't like to read?	344																						
348	344		301								Lucia	It's not that. I just rarely have the chance. I don't know where to start.	1																					
349	345		302								Well, then... Find a cover you think looks interesting.	346																						
350	346		301								Lucia	Alright.	1																					
351	347		202							1					1																			
352	348		301									Lucia walks up to a bookshelf. After looking through a row, she takes out a book. Some of the pages are missing, but she reads through it quickly.																						
353	349		301									Seeing Lucia absorbed in the book, you skim the titles of the books on the bookshelf to search for the ones you have not read.																						
354	350		301									However, you quickly realize that most of the books are incomplete.																						
355	351		301									Some books were burned, soiled, vandalized or repurposed as journals.																						
356	353		301									Others have been soaked, leaving traces of plants or food. You suspect that these books were taken out of the library and later returned by the Mini Bots.																						
357	354		301									Looking through the journals, you notice that even though the old handwriting seems to come from different authors, the content are more or less the same.																						
358	355		301									The journals describe a group of people gathering on this island after having nowhere else to go. They were surprised to discover such a low concentration of the Punishing Virus, but after living there a short period of time, the infection began to spread. The journals all cut off here.																						
359	356		301									Guess this explains all the ruins.																						
360	357		301									After you continue searching through all the books on the bookshelf, you discover an untitled book with an exquisite cover left in the corner.																						
361	358		301									Opening it, you discover that it's not actually a book. Instead, it's a foldable terminal.																						
362	359		302								...Select Stage?	360																						
363	360		301									You tap the screen, causing various fairytale stages to project above the screen.

365	362		301							1	Lucia	Commandant?	1

370	367		201							1	500347																							
371	368		301							1	Lucia	Looks like it's a terminal for playing staged fairy tales.	1																					
372	369		302								That's right.	370																						
373	370		301								Lucia	Also, it looks like the stage is this island.	1																					
374	371		302								Is it video memoire?	372																						
375	372		301								Lucia	What's that?	1																					
376	373		302								It's like a photo, but played on the terminal.	374																						
377	374		301								Lucia	I see.	1

386	383		302								Let's sit down and read it.	384																						
387	384		301								Lucia	(Nods)	1																					
388	385		202							1					1																			
389	386		301									Lucia hands the book terminal to you and turns to grab a blanket.

394	391		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						—Long, long ago there was a kingdom at the bottom of the sea, far, far away from humanity. It was a place where only mystical sea creatures lived and flourished.																						
395	392		301									Lucia's gaze is fully absorbed in the projection of the underwater palace coming from the terminal in your hands.																						
396	393		301									—Here lived the children of the sea. Their lower bodies were like the tail of a fish, and their upper bodies were like that of a human. Each child had the most immaculate beauty.																						
397	394		301									Of all the children, the youngest princess was the fairest of them all. Her skin was like rose petals, and her eyes were like deep lakes. Whenever she sang, all the fish would slow down to indulge in her beautiful song.																						
398	395		301									A melodious song plays from the terminal.																						
399	396		301								Lucia	The song's so pretty.																						
400	397		301									—On the year of the mermaid princess's fifteenth birthday, she received her grandmother's blessing to float up to the surface and witness the beauty of the imperfect land.																						
401	398		301									Just as she looks around excitedly, a magnificent ship approaches her. Aboard the ship, many people in the finest clothing are celebrating the prince's birthday.																						
402	399		301									At that moment, the mermaid princess falls in love with both the prince and everything around him. She swears in her heart that she will join this gorgeous but fragile kingdom no matter what.																						
403	400		301									In order to set foot on land, she seeks a witch who resides in an underwater cave. In exchange for her voice, she receives a potion that will split her tail into two legs.																						
404	401		302								Wait, this story...	402	...	407																				
405	402		302								It's different from what I remember.	403																						
406	403		301								Lucia	What's the original like?																						
407	404		302								In the original, she did that so she could meet the prince.	405																						
408	405		301								Lucia	So her reason is different in this version?																						
409	406		301									The two of you think for a moment.																						
410	407		301									But there was another price for using this potion. With each step, the princess will feel like she's stepping on the blade of a knife.																						
411	408		301									And also—if the prince banishes her, the morning before she must return home... she will be turned to seafoam.																						
412	409		301									But the cost does little to dissuade her. And with that, she says goodbye to her family, drinks the potion, and ventures to the prince's palace in great pain.																						
413	410		301									Although she had lost her voice, she wins over the hearts of others with the most beautiful dance the world had ever seen. Thus, she is allowed to stay in the palace.																						
414	411		301									As time goes on, she finds herself hopelessly in love with the prince.																						
415	412		301									The mermaid princess wants to tell her feelings to the prince, but she cannot. Not only because she has lost her voice, but also due to her status.																						
416	413		301									Because, even if people around her are overwhelmed by her beauty and elegance, the prince only regards her as a dancer.																						
417	414		301									One day, the prince travels out to sea in his magnificent ship. Without warning, a torrential storm forms overhead. On the way back, the prince comes across a ship that had struck a reef in the storm.																						
418	415		301									He takes ten of his guards and rescues the stranded crew from being swallowed by the sea.																						
419	416		301									Among the people who survived the shipwreck, there is a beautiful girl...																						
420	417		301									The prince is surprised to find that she was the princess of a neighboring kingdom. The two are in love at first sight and become engaged immediately thereafter.																						
421	424		301									In order to express his one-of-a-kind love, the prince orders the resignation of all the dancers in the palace.																						
422	425		301									The mermaid princess wants to confess her love for the prince, but all she can do is endure the pain in her feet and offer him one last dance.																						
423	426		301									When night falls, the little princess returns to the seaside and awaits the rising sun to turn her into seafoam.																						
424	427		301								Lucia	This is almost like a story about abandoning one's humanity to become a Construct.																						
425	428		301								Lucia	If you're abandoned by the military and unable to return to Babylonia, you'll end up with the same fate.																						
426	429		302								But a lot of people become Constructs because they have no choice.	430	I won't let that happen.	433																				
427	430		301								Lucia	You're right... Sorry for the tangent.																						
428	431		302								It's okay. Fairytales aren't as harsh as reality.	432																						
429	432	434	301								Lucia	But I believe that as long as you're on Gray Raven, Commandant, the three of us won't be met with the same fate.																						
430	433		301								Lucia	I believe that as long as you're on Gray Raven, Commandant, the three of us won't be met with the same fate.																						
431	434		301									Lucia smiles, then looks back at the terminal.																						
432	435		301									—But right as daybreak is upon her, she hears a familiar singing.																						
433	436		301									It's the sound of her sisters singing.																						
434	437		301									They had given their long luscious locks to the witch in exchange for a dagger.																						
435	438		301									So long as she is able to kill the prince with this dagger, her legs will return to their original form and she will be able to return to the sea.																						
436	439		301								Lucia	...																						
437	440		301									The princess grabs the dagger and returns to the prince's bedchamber. She ponders and ponders. But in the end, she is unable to strike down the prince.																						
438	441		301									The princess suddenly hears a noise outside the bedchamber, and quickly hides behind the curtains.																						
439	442		301									Between the gap in the curtains, she looks in horror as the attendants throw two familiar figures in front of the window.																						
440	443		301								???	Our sincerest apologies for disturbing you so late into the night, Your Highness.																						
441	444		301								Prince	No matter. I had yet to retire to bed anyway.																						
442	445		301								???	We captured these two mermaids just offshore. We overheard them plotting your assassination!																						
443	446		301								Prince	...Is that so?																						
444	447		301								???	Awaiting orders to execute them, Your Highness!																						
445	448		301									The prince remains quiet for a moment, then pulls out a sword hanging on the wall next to the window...																						
446	449		301									Seeing this, the princess can no longer bear the grief and anger. She jumps out from behind the curtain and stabs the prince in the chest with the dagger.																						
447	450		301									As the mermaid princess's legs are stained with his blood, the palace is engulfed by a tidal wave. Her legs return to their original fish-like tail, and she swims back to the underwater kingdom with her sisters to live happily ever after.																						
448	451		301								Lucia	I'm guessing the ending is completely different, too. Isn't it, Commandant?																						
449	452		302								That's right.	453																						
450	453		301								Lucia	But something seems a little strange.																						
451	454		301								Lucia	If the prince really hadn't fallen asleep like he said, wouldn't he have realized the princess was in the room?																						
452	455		302								You're right. Maybe there's more to the story.	456																						
453	456		301								Lucia	Was the author just being careless? Or are they trying to tell us something?																						
454	457		301								Lucia	Speaking of which... How did the original story end?																						
455	458		301									Right as you are about to tell Lucia, you see a hidden icon below with the text "Classic Mode" in dark gray letters.																						
456	459		301									After pressing it, the book terminal begins to play the audio once more. However, it is the original version.																						
457	460		301									—The beginning of the story is consistent with the revised version. When the little mermaid princess is 15 years old, she floats to the surface and becomes enamored with the prince and everything around him.																						
458	461		301									On the way to the prince's banquet, a surprise storm capsizes the prince's ship, and everyone falls into the water. Seeing that the prince is about to die, she swims over recklessly to save him and pulls him ashore.																						
459	462		301									But humans and mermaids are different creatures after all. In order to hide her secret, she hurries back to sea after confirming that the prince is safe.																						
460	463		301									Not long after, a young girl finds the prince. She alerts others to come help him, waking him up in the process. As a result, he mistakes her for the girl who saved him—not knowing anything about the little mermaid.																						
461	464		301									To set foot on land and meet with the prince again, she seeks a witch who resides in an underwater cave. In exchange for her voice, she receives a potion that will split her tail into two legs. But there is another price for using this potion. Each step the princess takes will feel like stepping on the blade of a knife.																						
462	465		301									And—if the prince proposes to another princess and does not accept her, then on the morning before the wedding day... she will turn to seafoam.																						
463	466		301									But the little princess has lost her voice and cannot speak to the prince. Even though those around him are overwhelmed by her dancing and beauty, the prince is still in love with the girl who rescued him on the beach.																						
464	467		301									Not long after, the king and the queen had chosen a bride for the prince—a princess from a neighboring kingdom. When the prince goes to pick her up by boat, he discovers that the princess was the same girl he thought saved him.																						
465	468		301									The two become engaged right there on the spot...																						
466	469		301									When night falls, the little princess returns to the seaside and awaits the rising sun to turn her into seafoam.																						
467	470		301									Hearing this news, her sisters had given their long luscious locks to the witch in exchange for a dagger. So long as she is able to kill the prince with this dagger, her legs will return to their original form and she will be able to return to the sea.																						
468	471		301									But that is not what the princess does. She cannot kill the prince in his sleep. Instead, she tosses the dagger into the sea.																						
469	472		301									When the sun rises... The most beautiful mermaid princess in the world returns to the sea as seafoam.																						
470	473		301								Lucia	Looks like the biggest difference is how the story ends.																						
471	474		302								You're right.	475																						
472	475		301								Lucia	In one ending, she kills the prince to protect her sisters. In the other ending, she sacrifices herself and allows the prince to continue living without knowing what she has done for him.																						
473	476		301								Lucia	It's still a sad story regardless of which ending it is... but I still prefer the original.																						
474	477		301								Lucia	Someone brave enough to die for what they love... That's true bravery.																						
475	478		302								Because that's what she chose?	479																						
476	479		301								Lucia	Yes. Even though it didn't end the way she wanted, she has no regrets.																						
477	480		302								Is that the kind of ending you would choose if you were her?	481																						
478	481		301								Lucia	...That kind of ending?																						
479	482		301								Lucia	Would you be upset if I sacrificed myself, Commandant?																						
480	483		302								Yes.	484	No.	489																				
481	484		301								Lucia	Then I wouldn't sacrifice myself. I wouldn't want to hurt you.																						
482	11486		302								Thank you.	485	But you've already done that.	487																				
483	485		301								Lucia	I'd never do anything to hurt you.																						
484	486	494	301								Lucia	If I'm forced to choose between the two, I'll find a third option.																						
485	487		301								Lucia	But that wasn't my ending. It was just a part of my life and a small part of my time in Gray Raven.																						
486	488	494	301								Lucia	And I didn't sacrifice myself because of that, Commandant. I may have taken a detour, but I'm back now.																						
487	489		301									Hearing this response, her expression barely changes.																						
488	490		301								Lucia	Good. If that day comes, I wouldn't want to hurt you.																						
489	491		301								Lucia	Saving Earth is a long and daunting mission. Sacrifices must be made along the way.																						
490	492		301								Lucia	If you're so caught up on sadness, you'll be stuck in the past and unable to move toward the future.																						
491	494		302								Sacrificing oneself should never be the premise for fighting.	495																						
492	495		301								Lucia	You're right. As long as you're here, I'll cherish my life.																						
493	496		301								Lucia	I'll protect myself—whether that's to save Earth more quickly or to stay with you even longer.																						
494	497		302								...And if I'm not here?	498	...And if I'm assigned to another team?	506																				
495	498		301								Lucia	...Then we'll see each other again once we rescue Earth.																						
496	499		302								I wasn't talking about being assigned to another team...	500																						
497	500		301								Lucia	I know. Just like the original version of the story...																						
498	501		301									Lucia's smile seems to hint at a frown.																						
499	502		301								Lucia	If you become seafoam, then I'll be the sea.																						
500	503		301								Lucia	If that day comes, I want to be wherever is closest to you... That way I can tell you about our victory again and again.																						
501	504		301								Lucia	But for me, the best future can only be achieved if you are beside me and the others. That's why I'll do everything in my power to protect you.																						
502	505		302								(Nods)	510	We'll do this together.	510																				
503	506		301								Lucia	As long as I know you're safe somewhere, I won't lose my way.																						
504	507		301								Lucia	When we save Earth, I'll find you.																						
505	508		301								Lucia	We'll be able to go wherever we want then. Can't we?																						
506	509		302								Of course.	510																						
507	510		301									Lucia smiles and nods, then looks back at the terminal.																						
508	511		301								Lucia	But... Why'd they want to change the original story to this?																						
509	512		302								Maybe to make it more novel?	513	Maybe they were writing what happened to them?	514																				
510	513	515	301								【kuroname】	In the records of the Golden Age, some authors would deliberately adapt familiar stories to entice readers.																						
511	514		301								【kuroname】	...This island has been deserted for too long. Maybe someone who once lived here wrote down their own experience through stories.																						
512	515		301								Lucia	I see. Perhaps, you're right.																						
513	516		301								Lucia	Hmm...																						
514	517		301								Lucia	I'd like to continue this discussion, but you need to get some rest, Commandant.																						
515	518		302								Okay, good night.	524	You should get some rest too, Lucia.	520																				
516	520		301								Lucia	Me?																						
517	522		301								Lucia	Constructs don't need to sleep, but I'll stay by your side until it's light out.																						
518	523		302								Okay, good night.	524
