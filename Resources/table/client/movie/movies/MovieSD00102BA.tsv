6	6		301								Lee	If we're going to plan for Christmas, we need to know what to prepare. We should be able to find information on past holidays in our database.	1

8	8		301								Lucia	I always used our database to research about engineering tech. I didn't know you'd be interested in that kind of a thing, Lee.	2

13	13		204							2																								
14	14		301								Lucia	But seeing as I've never celebrated Christmas... I just want to surprise Liv.	2																					
15	15		302								I'm sure she'll get that your heart is in the right place.	16																						
16	16		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lee	Let's get going before Liv sees us like this. We need to gather information and make a list, then come up with a plan.	1

27	27		204							1	10																							
28	28		301								Lee	You're right... I wasn't expecting different places to have their own ways of celebrating "Christmas".		1																				
29	29		301								Lee	Sorry, but I don't think we can do all of this at this point.	1																					
30	30		204							1																								
31	31		301								Lucia	I understand... but...	2																					
32	32		204							2	4																							
33	33		301								Lucia	We can't give up. I want to see Liv smile.	2																					
34	34		301								Lee	Of course. That's why we're all doing this together.	1																					
35	35		302								Maybe we can try looking at this from another angle.	36																						
36	36		204							2																								
37	37		301								Lucia	...What do you mean?	2																					
38	38		302								Maybe we can find some common elements to celebrate Christmas.	39																						
39	39		301								Lee	Not a bad idea. Each place has their own traditions, but they still share some commonalities.	1																					
40	1000		204							1	10																							
41	40		301								Lee	For example, Christmas trees are often made from spruce or fir trees, which are then decorated with socks filled with candy and gifts wrapped in colorful ribbons.	1																					
42	41		301								Lee	Inside is also decorated with Christmas decorations, bells, mistletoes, colorful lights and ribbons, then topped off with a delicious turkey dinner.	1																					
43	42		301								Lee	If it snows, it will be perfect. We can make snowmen and have snowball fights with each other, so it really feels like Christmas is in the air.	1																					
44	43		301								Lee	At midnight, the clock tower in the city will ring to bless everyone on Christmas Eve. Then we can watch the biggest fireworks show of the year...	1																					
45	44		301								Lee	This is a list of the common traditions for celebrating Christmas.	1																					
46	45		204							1	10																							
47	46		301								Lee	But we still have a problem...	1																					
48	47		204							1																								
49	48		301								Lee	We need a Christmas tree, decorations, snow, a Christmas Eve bell, and fireworks... But most importantly, we need manpower.	1																					
50	49		301								Lucia	What if we work overtime?	2																					
51	50		301								Lee	Lucia... Aside from the time we need to complete our mission... There isn't must time left...	1																					
52	51		301								Lucia	Looks like we'll need to call in backup.	2																					
53	52		301								Lee	If the commandant doesn't have any objections, I second the motion.	1																					
54	53		302								Of course, I support it. But who...?	54
