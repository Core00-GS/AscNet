4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Lucia	I did it. Want to give it a try, Commandant?	1																					
5	5		301									Lucia hands you a bag of freshly popped popcorn.																						
6	6		302								It's... interesting.	7																						
7	7		301									The taste of black pepper spreads throughout your mouth, complementing the aroma of popcorn. Although it's different from the traditionally sweet taste, you still find it delicious.																						
8	8		302								But... delicious.	9																						
9	9		204							1	2																							
10	10		301									After getting your approval, Lucia starts to try other flavor combinations.																						
11	11		301									Rather than mixing a large number of seasonings into the machine, she gradually mixes the flavors to taste.																						
12	12		301									Even then, some of the combinations are less than ideal...																						
13	13		302								Time to open it.	14

16	16		301									"Bang!"																						
17	17		301									This time the popcorn has the sour tang of tomato.

19	19		502							RImgBg1Shake																								
20	20		301									"Bang!"																						
21	21		301									This time it's chocolate. Compared with just adding sugar, the addition of cocoa butter gives it a rich aroma.

23	23		502							RImgBg1Shake																								
24	24		301									"Bang!"																						
25	25		301									This time Lucia adds capsaicin.																						
26	26		302								It's so spicy!	27

29	29		301									"Bang!"

31	31		301								Lucia	This should be enough.	1																					
32	32		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Lucia stops making popcorn after confirming that she has enough, despite leaving several seasonings and flavor combinations untouched.

36	36		301			DialogEnable				1		On the way back, you watch Lucia munching on the only bag of spicy popcorn and ask her a question that had been on your mind.																						
37	37		302								Why are you so persistent about cooking?	38																						
38	38		301								Lucia	Because... it's my weakness.	1																					
39	39		301									The more people know themselves, the more difficult it is to tolerate their own insurmountable defects, especially in the eyes of others.																						
40	40		301									The reason why Lucia chose to make popcorn was that it would show her dedication to overcoming her greatest weakness.																						
41	500		201							1	500151	2																						
42	41		301							1	Lucia	But I'm very happy you like my popcorn, Commandant.	1																					
43	42		302								I'm surprised.	43																						
44	43		302								Have you been practicing?	44																						
45	44		301								Lucia	Yes. I've had a lot of people help me between missions.	1																					
46	45		301								Lucia	Liv, Chrome, Bianca, Karenina...	1																					
47	46		302								Even Karenina?	47																						
48	47		301									Karenina is always looking for a showdown with Lucia. It's hard to imagine her teaching Lucia to cook.																						
49	48		301									Now that the festivities are starting to quiet down, you start to see the venue clear out.																						
50	49		301									You stuff another handful of popcorn in your mouth, releasing the subtle bitter-sweet flavor of chocolate.																						
51	50		301									Watching Lucia continue to eat her spicy popcorn, you make up your mind.																						
52	51		302								Lucia.	52																						
53	52		204							1																								
54	53		301							1	Lucia	Commandant?	1																					
55	54		302								How about we cook together next time?																							
56	55		301								Lucia	...	1																					
57	56		204							1	2																							
58	57		301								Lucia	Yeah.	1																					
59	58		301								Lucia	My pleasure.	1
