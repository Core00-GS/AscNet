13	13		301									Feeling an intense pain as if her M.I.N.D. is torn apart, Liv finds her vision blurred, having to lean on the wall to keep her balance.																						
14	14		301									It has been 28 days since she returned to Babylonia.																						
15	15		301									The more times she adapts to the new specialized frame, the more intense the pain her M.I.N.D. suffers. She figures it is the "migraine" Asimov mentioned in the beginning.																						
16	16		301									Although the migraine has become less frequent with the help of Professor Hippocrates, the intensity has not lessened. She feels like her head is impaled, and she struggles to focus.																						
17	17		204							1	19																							
18	18		301								Liv	This is how we lost all the Constructs that were sacrificed during their adaptations...	1																					
19	19		301								Liv	No... This is probably not the only reason...	1																					
20	20		204							1	8																							
21	21		301									Mournfully, Liv closes her eyes, trying desperately to stabilize her M.I.N.D.

23	23		301								Liv	I have to get up... The patients are still waiting...	1

25	25		301									It is six in the morning.																						
26	26		301									Even when the rescue missions to the surface have been halted for nearly a month, mornings in Star of Life are still as busy as ever.																						
27	27		301									With many Constructs and medics forced to enter their residency early, Star of Life has become even more chaotic in some ways.																						
28	28		301									Still, many wounded have had a fighting chance during the most critical moments only because these Constructs and medics were there to share many of the duties.

31	31		301							1	Support Construct	Good morning, miss Liv.	2																					
32	32		301								Liv	Mhm... good morning.	1																					
33	33		301								Support Construct	Right. I ran into a liaison officer on my way here.	2																					
34	34		301								Support Construct	He asked me to tell you that you don't have to visit him because there were no messages last night.	2																					
35	35		301								Liv	...I see. Thank you.	1																					
36	36		202							1	2				1																			
37	37		301									There is still no news from her companions today. When was the last time she saw a mission report?																						
38	38		301									The reports were still sent in regularly during the first 15 days she was back on Babylonia, mostly regarding the base underneath City 047.																						
39	39		301									Those were hardly good days, but Liv dared not to wish for more as long as she knew her friends were safe.																						
40	40		301									After the 15th day, Babylonia lost contact with Gray Raven for 3 whole days. By the time they received another report, Lucia, Lee, and Chrome had hidden inside a church with a few remaining survivors.																						
41	41		301									The three of them were fighting in the church ruins when they uploaded the report. They could not disclose much, having only submitted the test result of Omega II without being able to collect detailed data.																						
42	42		301									Afterward, "no updates" has been the only answer Liv receives when she inquires about her friends and the surface.																						
43	43		301									"Their locators show that they're still moving. No news is good news." "You're carrying a heavy burden. You should prioritize the adaptation." She heard those answers when she was sent away after pressing.																						
44	44		201							1	1031001	19																						
45	45		301							1	Liv	...	1																					
46	46		301									Is that really good news?																						
47	47		301									Looking at the corridor in Star of Life, Liv recalls seeing Murray there earlier.																						
48	48		301									The young man who always wears a smile on his face was nothing but worried, trying to find Hippocrates to confirm something.																						
49	49		301									She wanted to ask the Professor about it, but Hippocrates never told her.																						
50	50		301								Liv	Lucia... Lee...	1																					
51	51		301									Amidst all the pain she is suffering, Liv is trying to come up with a way to find out how her teammates are doing.

67	67		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Hippocrates takes Liv toward the ward where the Gray Raven Commandant is staying.																						
68	68		301								Hippocrates	If all goes well, this will be your last 24 hours—eh... before you depart.	2																					
69	69		204							1	1																							
70	70		301								Liv	Really? Finally...	1																					
71	71		301									Realizing that she will soon reunite with her companions, Liv feels slightly relieved.																						
72	72		204							2	5																							
73	73		301								Hippocrates	Oh? "Finally"?	2																					
74	74		204							2	14																							
75	75		301								Hippocrates	Is that all you've got to say?	2																					
76	76		204							1																								
77	77		301								Liv	...I'm sorry, Professor. I...	1																					
78	78		301									Even though she understands what the Professor is asking, Liv cannot say it.																						
79	79		301									Why create more pain with her tears when her fate is sealed?																						
80	80		301									Looking at the silent Liv, Hippocrates sighs and sits on a chair by the bed.																						
81	81		204							2																								
82	82		301								Hippocrates	Do you know what some of the other teachers and I thought of you when you were still a student?	2																					
83	83		301									Slightly confused, Liv looks at the Professor, uncertain if she's referring to the comments written on her assessment manual.																						
84	84		301								Hippocrates	Grounded? Hardworking? Studious?	2																					
85	85		301								Hippocrates	Nah. You were a fool.	2																					
86	86		204							1	3																							
87	87		301								Liv	...I see.	1																					
88	88		204							1																								
89	89		301								Liv	I know I often couldn't keep up with others.	1																					
90	90		301								Hippocrates	The teacher who taught you clinical care passed away about half a year ago.	2																					
91	91		204							1	19																							
92	92		301								Liv	...	1																					
93	93		301								Hippocrates	There's no need to be upset. She was old. It happens. But she mentioned you to me before she left.	2																					
94	94		301									Hippocrates takes out a sealed bag from her pocket and drops it on the commandant's bed.																						
95	95		204							2	14																							
96	96		301									The Professor looks at Liv, frowning, her sorrowful eyes filled with nothing but grief.																						
97	97		204							1	7																							
98	98		301								Liv	That's...	1																					
99	99		301									Liv takes the sealed bag from the bed and opens it. Inside are seven medical injectors, each serving a different purpose. Yet she cannot recall where they come from.																						
100	100		301								Hippocrates	These are the things you used to treat yourself when you were a medic.	2																					
101	101		301								Hippocrates	She asked you why you operated on yourself. What was the answer you gave?	2																					
102	102		204							1																								
103	103		301								Liv	...I didn't want to trouble others. And I'd learn how painful the injections could be... This way, I can improve my techniques and make it hurt a little less.	1																					
104	104		301								Hippocrates	You could've used the training equipment to practice, but you insisted.	2																					
105	105		301									The Professor mutters as she lifts the blanket that is covering 【kuroname】 and performs palpation on the commandant.																						
106	106		301								Hippocrates	That was the first time that teacher saw a fool like you. Blood draws, sutures, injections... you did them all yourself, and you left her quite an impression...	2																					
107	107		301								Hippocrates	Eventually, she started collecting the equipment you used after sterilizing them. Reminders, she said. Lest the deaths we've seen cost us our empathy.	2																					
108	108		301								Hippocrates	...Ha. "Lest the deaths we've seen cost us our empathy."	2																					
109	109		301								Hippocrates	Medical procedures were painless as early as the Golden Age. But the apocalypse has returned all those intricate, machine-made equipment to their original forms.	2																					
110	110		301								Hippocrates	Most medical practitioners were already spent after the outbreak. Students had to rely on the feedback from the training equipment to practice, and that came with many limitations. But who could afford to care?	2																					
111	111		301								Hippocrates	Even with some of the production lines recovered, we had to prioritize the equipment needed by the military. Treatment effect over painlessness.	2																					
112	112		301								Hippocrates	When fighting and survival are the most important factors... when we could lose our empathy from the deaths we see... Who cares how much injections and sutures hurt?	2																					
113	113		301									Shaking her head, Hippocrates retracts her hands from the commandant and places the blanket back.																						
114	114		301								Hippocrates	You care. That's why you're a fool.	2																					
115	115		301								Hippocrates	That's why I had to keep up with what you were doing even when I retired.	2																					
116	116		301								Hippocrates	I was relieved when I heard you were doing alright in Gray Raven.	2																					
117	117		301								Hippocrates	...But this world will not let anyone leave unscathed.	2																					
118	118		301									Hippocrates lowers her head, concealing her expression from Liv.																						
119	119		301								Hippocrates	They used to say that "fortune favors fools." Fools get left behind. Fools don't get sent to the frontline and die.	2																					
120	120		301								Hippocrates	...But so many of my students are gone. And now you're going too...	2																					
121	121		301									The aging Professor grabs Liv's hands, her voice breaking and trembling, as though this one act would keep Liv here when Liv cannot stay.																						
122	122		204							1	19																							
123	123		301								Liv	Professor... I...	1																					
124	124		301								Hippocrates	I tried. I tried, but you couldn't live.	2																					
125	125		301								Hippocrates	...And I couldn't wake up your commandant.	2																					
126	126		301								Hippocrates	...I failed. I retired, and it cost me so much time.	2																					
127	127		301								Hippocrates	【kuroname】 might never wake up again.	2																					
128	128		301								Hippocrates	...I even tried to convince them to wait a few more days. If your commandant wakes up, it would solve so many problems.	2																					
129	129		301								Hippocrates	...But so many people are dying down there. We're out of time...	2																					
130	130		301								Hippocrates	I'm sorry I couldn't save you...	2																					
131	131		204							1	1																							
132	132		301								Liv	Professor... please don't be upset. Everything you've taught me, past and present, has been supporting me to this day.	1																					
133	133		301								Hippocrates	Ha... Past and present...	2																					
134	134		301								Hippocrates	I just want you to have a future.	2																					
135	135		204							1																								
136	136		301									The Professor closes her eyes and shakes her head, locking up all the grief that makes her waver. She stands up and walks toward the door.																						
137	137		204							2	1																							
138	138		301								Hippocrates	...It's too late to say anything now.	2

145	145		301									Following Hippocrates to Asimov's laboratory, Liv finds it more desolated than usual.																						
146	146		301									Only Asimov and Rosa remain in the room filled with monitors and equipment.																						
147	147		301									Seeing Liv enter, the assistant walks up to greet her before leaving with a box of things.																						
148	148		301								Asimov	Our hope lies within this frame because it is capable of "purifying" the Punishing Virus. This is the first time we can truly eliminate the virus.	1																					
149	149		301								Asimov	But that also means that the procedure of changing the frame comes with classified information. Which is why only Professor Hippocrates and I are here.	1																					
150	150		301									Asimov stares at the file before him and pauses for a moment.																						
151	151		301								Asimov	...One last thing.	1																					
152	152		301								Asimov	Since the frame is mainly built upon the data of an agent, its capabilities are also similar.	1																					
153	153		301								Asimov	Still, this is just an "imitation," and you have never gone through the "filtering" that we know of...	1																					
154	154		301								Asimov	Once the fight begins, it won't be long before you reach your threshold and lose control.	1																					
155	155		301								Asimov	Unlike the specialized frames given to Lucia and Chrome... this time, I cannot give you any guarantee.	1																					
156	156		201							1	1031001																							
157	157		301							1	Liv	That's okay. I understand.	1

159	159		301							1	Asimov	Now, this is just a hypothesis, yet to be confirmed—	1																					
160	160		301								Asimov	But when the Punishing Virus "drawn" by the specialized frame outpaces the rate the Omega Weapon can "absorb" it, and the infection passes your threshold...	1																					
161	161		301								Asimov	...You might be able to enter the Ascension-Network while conscious with the help of this frame.	1																					
162	162		201							1	1031001	7																						
163	163		301							1	Liv	The Ascension-Network?	1																					
164	164		201							1	500004	9																						
165	165		301							1	Asimov	That's right. If it does happen, it will be a rare opportunity.	1																					
166	166		201							1	1031001	7																						
167	167		301							1	Liv	What do I need to do?	1																					
168	168		201							1	500004	9																						
169	169		301							1	Asimov	You just have to be ready to respond. With the M.I.N.D. needle probe, we can see everything you see.	1																					
170	170		301								Asimov	Our old records speak of the Ascnet as a network built among many Corrupted to share information with each other.	1																					
171	171		301								Asimov	But having witnessed agents, the Red Tide, and Hetero-Creatures, we have yet to understand how they are all related.	1																					
172	172		204							1	8																							
173	173		301									Staring at the data, Asimov closes his eyes, exhausted by the slow updates. Technology and information are not progressing fast enough for him or the survivors living in a post-apocalypse.
