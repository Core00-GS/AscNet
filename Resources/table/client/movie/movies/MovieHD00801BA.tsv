16	16		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Expressionless, Asimov watches the footage recorded from the CUB while operating the calibration panel before him.																						
17	17		201							1	500004																							
18	18		301							1	Asimov	Hm...	1																					
19	19		301									The test with the CUB has caused a bit of a ruckus on the surface earlier, and now that Asimov has finally finished cleaning up the mess, all he has left to do is the final calibration on the AI system.																						
20	20		301									Once in a while, a light chuckle can be heard not far from where he is, prompted by the images in the footage.																						
21	21		301								Asimov	So, do I need to give you a copy of the footage so you can enjoy it at the WGAA?	1																					
22	22		301									Asimov does not need to turn around to know that Allen is shaking his head while smiling.																						
23	23		203							1	0.25	450																						
24	24		201							2	500111		-450																					
25	25		301							1	Allen	That's not necessary. I think the mission report from that commandant will be even more entertaining.	2																					
26	26		301								Allen	Can't say I'm not jealous of how much fun they seem to be having down there. Aren't you going to join them and take a break, Asimov?	2																					
27	27		301								Asimov	That won't be necessary... The work here is going to take a while before it's done. After that, we should be able to put the CUBs into real combat.	1																					
28	28		301									Asimov takes a heavy breath through his nose, his eyes still fixated on the shifting data on his display.																						
29	29		301								Asimov	It's a joint project between the WGAA and the Science Council, after all. With all the resources we've put in, the least it can be is perfect...	1																					
30	30		301									Allen smiles, and he stands up to examine the CUB, his interest piqued. The CUB also raises its head, its lens rotating, observing Allen in return curiously.																						
31	31		301								Allen	I feel like the machine is livelier than even you, Asimov...	2																					
32	32		301								Asimov	Perhaps it's because the test subjects have all been emotionally-rich. We do have to pay attention to the differences in the M.I.N.D.s of different users...	1																					
33	33		301									Listening to Asimov talking to himself about his analysis, Allen cannot help but put on a wry smile.																						
34	34		301								Allen	Sigh... That's not what I meant, but I think that's the reply I was expecting.	2																					
35	35		301									At this moment, they hear a knock from outside the door. Asimov takes a look at the surveillance monitor, and then he opens the door.																						
36	36		301								Allen	You're having a lot of guests today, aren't you?	2																					
37	37		301								Asimov	Don't be so sure... Maybe it's your guest.	1

41	41		201							1	500110																							
42	42		301							1	Ayla	Chairman, Leonie said I could find you here, and here you are.	1

44	44		201							2	500111		450																					
45	45		301							1	Allen	Ayla? Do you need me for something?	2																					
46	46		301									Ayla takes out a leaflet from her well-prepared folder and hands it to Allen, and she passes another one to Asimov.																						
47	47		301								Ayla	Have you forgotten already? The Culture Department of WGAA is hosting some festivities for Lunar New Year this year, but we still haven't finalized a proposal, so they asked me to find you to join the meeting.	1																					
48	48		202							1	2				1																			
49	49		201							1	500004																							
50	50		301							1	Asimov	You could just send this to our comms terminal... There's no need to waste paper.	1

55	55		204							1																								
56	56		301									And then Ayla notices the CUB with the many wires and tubes attached to it, and she cannot help but run over to it and hugs it.																						
57	57		301								Ayla	Is this critter the thing Leonie designed? What a cutie-pie! I think they also have an official name for it... Yuan something.	2																					
58	58		301								Allen	I believe it's "Yuan Ye," named by Leonie herself.	1																					
59	59		301									Asimov gives Ayla a quick glance before focusing on his display again.																						
60	60		202							1	2				1																			
61	61		201							1	500004																							
62	62		301							1	Asimov	I don't know why you'd think it's cute, but please, don't hug it too hard. I'm still calibrating it...	1																					
63	63		301									Before Asimov can finish, Yuan Ye falls to its side from the force of Ayla's embrace, and the connecting wires are torn and spark everywhere.																						
64	64		202							1					1																			
65	65		201							1	500111																							
66	66		301							1	Allen	Ayla... are you okay?	1																					
67	67		301									Ayla stands up with the help of the other two people in the room, looking extremely embarrassed for pushing Yuan Ye over.																						
68	68		201							1	500110	4																						
69	69		301							1	Ayla	S-sorry! I didn't think it...	1																					
70	70		301									Asimov does a quick check on Yuan Ye's broken parts without blaming Ayla for the damage.																						
71	71		201							1	500004																							
72	72		301							1	Asimov	It's fine... It wasn't your fault. The damaged parts are probably caused by the previous combat trial... It was too intense, I suppose. We'll have to work on it some more.	1																					
73	73		301									Ayla is still apologizing when Asimov notices that the leaflets Ayla has brought over have been scattered on the floor. He picks one up and finds a piece of red paper with nothing printed on it.																						
74	74		301								Asimov	What's this?	1																					
75	75		201							1	500110																							
76	76		301							1	Ayla	Oh, this? It's just some spare paper. I haven't decided what to print on it...	1																					
77	77		203							1	0.25	-450																						
78	78		201							2	500111		450																					
79	79		301							1	Allen	Asimov, come and take a look. Something seems to be wrong with Yuan Ye.	2																					
80	80		301									The fallen Yuan Ye starts scanning the red paper next to it, and words begin to appear on the paper.																						
81	81		204							1	4																							
82	82		301								Ayla	What is it doing? D-don't tell me I broke its brain when it fell!	1																					
83	83		301								Allen	Huh? Is it... printing? I didn't realize it can do that.	2																					
84	84		202							1	2				1																			
85	85		201							1	500004																							
86	86		301							1	Asimov	It's a test function. The idea was that it could leave messages on the walls or other surfaces for the Constructs when they're on a mission in places with a bad connection.	1																					
87	87		202							1					1																			
88	88		301									Ayla takes a closer look at the words printed. Despite them being just short phrases, they do seem to have a certain rhythm and rhyme to them.																						
89	89		201							1	500111		450																					
90	90		201							2	500110	4	-450																					
91	91		301							1	Ayla	They don't seem like random gibberish...	2																					
92	92		301								Allen	I believe they're called "couplets," an old tradition from the east. They would calligraph them on a pair of red paper during Lunar New Year as their best wishes for the coming year.	1																					
93	93		202							1	2				1																			
94	94		201							1	500004																							
95	95		301							1	Asimov	It was around the Forsaken for a while during the tests, plus its time with the New Year-enthusiasts Xi, Yuan Ye might just have recorded some related data.	1																					
96	96		202							1					1																			
97	97		301									Ayla seems to have come up with an idea and claps.																						
98	98		201							1	500111		450																					
99	99		201							2	500110	1	-450																					
100	100		301							1	Ayla	How about this, Chairman? We can just send these couplets out as decor for people to put on the walls!	2																					
101	101		301								Allen	Um... Not a bad idea. Traditional couplets written by an AI system—it sounds like a great gimmick.	1																					
102	102		204							2																								
103	103		301									Yuan Ye is still printing out dozens of words on the stack of red paper, but as the two go through them, they only find incomplete couplets.																						
104	104		301								Ayla	There's a problem—it's only writing the first parts of the couplets. The rest of them are all incomplete words and phrases... That won't finish the set!	2																					
105	105		202							1	2				1																			
106	106		201							1	500004																							
107	107		301							1	Asimov	I could help with that.	1																					
108	108		202							1					1																			
109	109		301									Ayla turns and looks at Asimov, astonished.																						
110	110		201							1	500110																							
111	111		301							1	Ayla	Asimov...? You're willing to help?	1																					
112	112		201							1	500004																							
113	113		301							1	Asimov	I'll have to deal with this issue sooner or later... Anyway, isn't matching couplets just a game of decoding? That's my expertise.	1

115	115		201							1	500111		450

117	117		301							1	Ayla	That... I don't think is entirely true...	2																					
118	118		301								Allen	Hey, I think it's a brilliant idea. Ayla, let's go apply for permission for this program. We'll leave this to Asimov.	1

126	126		301								Allen	Rarely is he interested in any kind of festivity, so isn't it great that he's finally found something that he can enjoy? We're doing all these because we want people to enjoy the holiday, aren't we?	1																					
127	127		301								Ayla	When you put it this way, we've never really seen Asimov do anything apart from researching and fighting...	2																					
128	128		301								Allen	Also, think about it... "Couplets created with the help of Chief Technician Asimov" is so much more enticing than "written by an AI system," isn't it?	1																					
129	129		301								Ayla	No one would have expected Asimov to help, for sure... Then I'll inform the WGAA and ask for their assistance while you apply for permission from President Hassen.	2
