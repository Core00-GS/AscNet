12	12		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You arrive at the designated lab. The "In Use" sign on the door is alight, a jarring sight in this barren building. You are about to enter, when someone suddenly muffles your mouth.

15	15		301							1	Vera	Shh.	1																					
16	16		301				DialogDisable					It is Vera. Her face takes up the entirety of your vision. She pulls you inside, and you hear low conversations under the dim light of the lab.	1

20	20		301								Helpless Voice	They be clamping down on this stuff, mate. Went through many hoops for 'em.																						
21	21		302								These people...	22	Smugglers?!	22																				
22	22		301								Vera	Tch—shut the hell up. If we get found, I'm shoving you out.	1																					
23	23		302								(Lightly) Are they talking about Haelios?	24																						
24	24		301								Vera	Why else would I be here?	1																					
25	25		301								Helpless Voice	Welp. This'll be the last batch for a while to come.																						
26	26		301								Helpless Voice	All thanks to them council people, it's been getting harder and harder to acquire this stuff. And the price's more than doubled.																						
27	27		301								Vera	Wow. Your bosses have so much time on their butts. They're sticking their noses into this?	1																					
28	28		302								Don't ask me...	29	Of course!	29																				
29	29		301								Vera	These two pieces of trash too. They're quitting just because of some lil' government restriction?	1

32	32		301								Deep Voice	Can't be helped, I guess... Give me all that you have right now.																						
33	33		301								Helpless Voice	There's still more inside. I'll go grab 'em.																						
34	34		401							2	1516																							
35	35		301									The footsteps grow louder and closer.

39	39		302								What something?	42																						
40	40		301								Vera	Duh? I can hear. Don't worry, though. I've got something. They won't find me.	1

42	42		202							1					1																			
43	43		301									Vera blinks at you in the dark before sliding her gaze outward. Her hands on you tighten up, and you tense up as well, as if infected by Vera.																						
44	44		301								Helpless Voice	Huh... Should be here...																						
45	45		301								Helpless Voice	Ah, right. Down here.																						
46	46		401							2	1516																							
47	47		301									The footsteps grow, but pause around a meter before where you and Vera are hiding. You feel momentary relief from not being found out.

55	55		301									You crash into the smuggler. He seems to be quite taken aback and is fumbling like a drunkard. The medication vials scatter to the floor.																						
56	56		302								(Snatch one vial)	57																						
57	57		301								Smuggler A	The hell?! Where'd you come from?! Wait, no! Catch this clown!	1																					
58	58		301									The man before you yelps hysterically. The other smuggler, finally realizing the situation, quickly aims his weapon at you.

78	76		301			DialogEnable						You run like mad. When you finally realize that the two smugglers are no longer on your trail, you raggedly jog to a halt. Hands on your knees, you fill your lungs with gulps of air to the drumming of your heart.

84	81		301								Vera	Thanks to your valiant effort, the juice is all mine. Now we're even.	1																					
85	82		302								Even?	83																						
86	83		301								Vera	You didn't forget about yesterday already, didn't you? Those anesthetics don't come cheap. I've even given you a discount.	1

91	88		302								Forget something?	89																						
92	89		301									You fish out the medication vial from your pocket. Vera's expression turns into one of amazement.

99	96		301								Vera	You what?	1																					
100	97		301								Vera	I'm not the patient sort. I'll give you another chance. Name a price, or I'm wrenching it out of your hand.	1

102	99	108	301								Vera	I don't care what you think! Gimme that!	1																					
103	100		301								Vera	You heard 'em, yeah? This thing's getting clamped. Doesn't hurt to stock up.	1																					
104	101	108	301								Vera	Whatever. I don't care what you think! Gimme that!	1																					
105	102		301								Vera	Then name a price.	1
