4	4		301									Geniuses' existence does not bother many people, but their downfalls are undoubtedly the most captivating gossip.																						
5	5		301									Due to using M.I.N.D. connections so intensely to the point of self-harm, he suffered incurable mental damages that disqualified him from forever being a commandant, and he instead volunteered to be a Construct.																						
6	6		301									—Everyone will hear about this story one way or the other, even without actively searching for it.																						
7	7		301									F.O.S. Military Command College is meant to cultivate commandants that can command Constructs. Instead, he has ended up as a chess piece to be commanded.																						
8	8		301									Although his specialized Inver-Device means that he does not have to be bonded to a commandant, just being a Construct is enough to cast Chrome in a narrative he cannot alter.																						
9	9		301									To allow a Construct on a stage to speak as an alumnus...																						
10	10		301									To some people, this is as offensive as a subordinate ordering his superiors around.																						
11	11		301									Even when this Construct was once a Chief of F.O.S.

15	15		302			AniZhuanchangEnd					Should we pause?	16																						
16	16		301			DialogEnable						You halt the game for some reason.																						
17	17		301									Chrome stops his move.																						
18	18		201							1	500309																							
19	19		301							1	Chrome	Not a bad idea. It wouldn't have been proper if we keep playing when our minds are filled with thoughts other than chess.	1																					
20	20		301								Chrome	I'm not in the right mood to play, anyway. After all, playing chess... is one of the few things left that relax me.	1																					
21	21		302								Do you enjoy it?																							
22	22		301								Chrome	...	1																					
23	23		301								Chrome	Enjoyment was not a factor when I first learned it. As a Smith, I had to master everything in every field.	1																					
24	24		301								Chrome	Especially when my father would play with me once in a while.	1																					
25	25		301								Chrome	I lost the first few games, however, and it greatly disappointed him.	1																					
26	26		301								Chrome	To gain his approval, I practiced frantically after school.	1																					
27	27		301								Chrome	Unexpectedly... I started to appreciate the joy of chess as I practiced with the AI.	1																					
28	28		301								Chrome	With just 64 squares, it contains possibilities that a person cannot fathom even with a lifetime.	1																					
29	29		301								Chrome	It takes so much time just to come up with a tactic and a countermove, but that time never feels wasted.	1																					
30	30		301								Chrome	So it became a personal love eventually, and I've been playing ever since.	1																					
31	31		302								You practiced with an AI?	32																						
32	32		301								Chrome	Is that what caught your attention?	1																					
33	33		202							1					1																			
34	34		301									Remembering the past, Chrome's gaze slightly shifts downward.																						
35	35		201							1	500309																							
36	36		301							1	Chrome	I wasn't exactly sociable when I was studying here.	1																					
37	37		301								Chrome	No classmate would play with me.	1																					
38	38		302								Seriously?	39																						
39	39		301									Before he can answer—																						
40	40		302								I'm so sorry about that.	41																						
41	41		301								Chrome	Huh?	1																					
42	42		302								I'm so sorry that they missed the chance to play with such a great player.	43																						
43	43		301								Chrome	...Is that so?	1																					
44	44		301								Chrome	As you said...	1																					
45	45		301								Chrome	If we were from the same year, and you were sitting in front of me...	1																					
46	46		302								Perhaps we would become great friends.	47																						
47	47		202							1					1																			
48	48		301									His lips tighten as he considers the possibility.																						
49	49		301									You are surprised that something you just threw out can have Chrome lost in thought for so long.																						
50	50		301									After a while, he comes to a conclusion and replies solemnly—																						
51	51		201							1	500309																							
52	52		301							1	Chrome	I think... like you said, I think we would.	1																					
53	53		202							1					1																			
54	54		301									But there is no "if" in real life.																						
55	55		301									You both know these are just empty words, unmanifested.																						
56	56		301									Thus your conversation comes to an end.																						
57	57		302								Hey, seeing that it's a rare open day on the campus...	58																						
58	58		302								You want to take a walk outside?	59																						
59	59		301									The holographic projection turns off, and Chrome stands up from his seat.																						
60	60		401							2	1516																							
61	61		301									He steps in front of you, his hand reaching out as his body slightly bows.																						
62	62		301									A perfect, impeccable gesture of invitation that carries with it respect and an aura that does not accept refusal.																						
63	63		201							1	500309	1																						
64	64		301							1	Chrome	I should be the one asking.	1																					
65	65		202							1					1																			
66	66		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Says Chrome, gently, with a twinkle in his eyes.
