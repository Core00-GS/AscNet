9	9		301									Seeing that we were completely defeated and unable to fight, the satisfied King kept laughing, as if he was proclaiming his victory.

13	13		301							1	King	Right... Now that we already have the four fragments, I only need to shout out... Show yourself, Demon King's Castle!	1																					
14	14		301									Karenina kept struggling, trying to break away from Vera's control. The King sneered at her, then turned away and continued calling for the castle.																						
15	15		301									The summoning was successful eventually. A castle-like building suddenly appeared in the center of the empty land.																						
16	16		301								King	Take the Holy Maiden and that hostage. Let's go to the very end and enjoy our victory.	1

29	29		301							1	Demon King	How can you still be so calm? The King has all the artifact now! If they ever get to the altar, we are all doomed!	1																					
30	30		301								Demon King	The Holy Maiden will be forced to repair the artifact for him. It's over!	1
