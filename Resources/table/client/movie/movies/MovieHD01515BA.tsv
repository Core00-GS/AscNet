16	16		301								No. 21	I want to, put them, inside the lantern.	1																					
17	17		301								Noctis	Just wait for me to finish hanging the lantern first.	2

19	19		301								No. 21	Hmph... Buddy, go.	1																					
20	20		301									No. 21 gives the candles to her Co-Bot. Noctis tries to cast it away, but it continues to climb up Noctis' head.

28	28		301							1	Kamui	I used all the feats on that sword attack. Super critical, super strength... And every roll was critical success. It's been a long time since they ever had such a powerful attack in the system record.	1																					
29	29		301								Construct Member	Yeah, and it landed right on my face. 48 damage. They couldn't even take my body off the ground.	2																					
30	30		301								Kamui	Who would have thought I rolled a critical failure on the hit check? Was that lucky or unlucky...?	1																					
31	31		301									Kamui is helping Wanshi to put on a "bush" costume. Rumor has it that in a subsequent patch, Wanshi managed to stay stealth in an area for 7 days thanks to this camouflage. When he woke up, he successfully defeated the Demon King who was on patrol.

47	47		301								Karenina	Tch... I'll build a scaffold then. Special effects alone won't be enough.	1																					
48	48		301								Teddy	Don't worry, my effects are flawless with Ayla's guidance.	2																					
49	49		301									In front of the terminal used for scene simulation and after effects, Karenina and Teddy are discussing the performance. Liv walks to them and hands over a few rice dumplings.

56	56		302								I'll call that a great success.	57																						
57	57		301								Ayla	Yeah!	1																					
58	59		301								Ayla	They have always been fighting together, but sometimes they still ignore each other. It's a strange feeling.	1																					
59	60		301								Ayla	Maybe that's just what friends are. There may be some misunderstanding in the beginning, but eventually everything will turn out to be alright.	1																					
60	61		301								Ayla	Still, I think it is important to voice out our feelings. It is crucial for us to realize and acknowledge the importance of our friends.	1

62	63		301									You nod without answering. The center of the room has become a noisy site.																						
63	64		301									Karenina and Teddy are arguing again. No. 21 is holding her Co-Bot and running between others to run from Noctis. Lee and Wanshi are discussing where to place the ballista.																						
64	65		301									Before you realize it, you already have so many comrades to fight alongside.

67	68		301									It's time to dress up as an apple tree. Lucia is calling you with a smile.
