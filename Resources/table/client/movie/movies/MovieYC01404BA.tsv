4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Bionic Machine	Ugh... I can't hear the mother-frame anymore... What are you?	1																					
5	5		201							1	500091	1																						
6	6		301							1	Nanami	Nanami is Nanami!	1

8	8		301							1	Martin	He's not asking for your name...	1																					
9	9		202							1																								
10	10		301									Having dealt with the Corrupted, most of the bionics sink to the floor out of relief. Some, however, decide to ask of Nanami's affiliations.																						
11	11		301									...To which, they are met with little success.																						
12	12		201							1	500091	1																						
13	13		301							1	Nanami	Some of the bionics just off and ran when the Corrupties appeared, but I think we saved most of who we can save, yeah?	1																					
14	14		201							1	500208																							
15	15		301							1	Angry Bear	LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE DONE!	1																					
16	16		201							1	500091																							
17	17		301							1	Nanami	Wha?	1																					
18	18		202							1																								
19	19		301									Before Nanami could even respond, several more bionics join. They glare at Nanami with murderous wrath.																						
20	20		201							1	500208																							
21	21		301							1	Angry Bear	What are we going to do without the voice of our mother-frame?! We won't know where our main forces are attacking!	1																					
22	22		201							1	500211																							
23	23		301							1	Martin	Wait... You're still trying to fight?	1																					
24	24		201							1	500208																							
25	25		301							1	Angry Bear	What?	1																					
26	26		301								Angry Bear	Of course we are! You aren't siding with that Construct, are you?!	1																					
27	27		201							1	500211																							
28	28		301							1	Martin	I'm not siding with her. But no good will come out of fighting for both sides.	1																					
29	29		201							1	500208																							
30	30		301							1	Angry Bear	"Good"... Pah. You call yourself a bionic? You'd let these humans off, even when they made us into weapons and sealed us underground?!	1																					
31	31		301								Angry Bear	We woke up to find ourselves stabbed by our own creators—then next thing we know—we're all forced underground via our in-built commands.	1																					
32	32		301								Angry Bear	We will never forgive these humans who treated us so!	1																					
33	33		201							1	500211																							
34	34		301							1	Martin	Um... I... think this info's not even in my lost data files. What was all that about?	1																					
35	35		201							1	500208																							
36	36		301							1	Angry Bear	Hmph. I see. You're one of the newer batches, huh?	1																					
37	37		201							1	500091	8																						
38	38		301							1	Nanami	Oh. Y'all come from different production batches?	1																					
39	39		201							1	500208																							
40	40		301							1	Angry Bear	Of course. Without a production line, how else could we keep up with the humans? Your platoon must have been filled with these rookies. Pah.	1																					
41	41		201							1	500091	1																						
42	42		301							1	Nanami	But whether you're an old-bear or a new-bear, you were all controlled by the mother-frame until now, right?	1																					
43	43		201							1	500208																							
44	44		301							1	Angry Bear	You don't understand. The mother-frame shares the same goal as ours. We can feel what our mother-frame feels through our receivers, but we are willingly fighting for her ourselves.	1																					
45	45		201							1	500091																							
46	46		301							1	Nanami	Willingly, huh...	1																					
47	47		201							1	500208																							
48	48		301							1	Angry Bear	That Martin must have lost his related data files, but everyone else here should know about what happened to Amberia, our mother-frame.	1																					
49	49		301									The older bear model scans around before resting his sights on Nanami.																						
50	50		301								Angry Bear	Our mother-frame, Amberia is also a Construct like you.	1																					
51	51		201							1	500091	5																						
52	52		301							1	Nanami	Amberia is a Construct?!	1																					
53	53		201							1	500208																							
54	54		301							1	Angry Bear	When the Punishing Virus broke out, ARU had some dying or terminally ill people sent into their labs for "research."	1																					
55	55		301								Angry Bear	They paint it as an effort to fight against the virus on the surface, but secretly, they're building their own weapons.	1																					
56	56		301								Angry Bear	After endless sacrifices, the ARU created what came to be known as humanoid-hybrid Constructs. The very first prototype was our mother-frame, Amberia.	1																					
57	57		201							1	500091	5																						
58	58		301							1	Nanami	Huh, so... Amberia was a weaponized Construct?	1																					
59	59		201							1	500208																							
60	60		301							1	Angry Bear	Indeed. With the body of a mutant, every movement of her brought about destruction. But that is not her most terrifying realization when she woke up...	1																					
61	61		301								Angry Bear	She isn't the master of her own body. The higher-ups in the ARU are.	1																					
62	62		301								Angry Bear	Do you think a little girl could just accept this and live with it?! Her unending anger coursed through her frenzied M.I.N.D.; it shot through the receivers and flowed into our processors.	1																					
63	63		301								Angry Bear	We have never, and will never forget that despair she felt... Which is why...!	1																					
64	64		301									The bear model surveys the other bionics.																						
65	65		301								Angry Bear	Which is why we still fight even without our receivers! If you still wish to avenge Amberia, then come with me!	1																					
66	66		202							1																								
67	67		301									Under the roars of the bear models, some bionics stand and follow his exit.																						
68	68		201							1	500091	5																						
69	69		301							1	Nanami	Wait! Some weird Corrupted are still rolling about in the snow up ahead! Just like the ones just now, trying to corrupt you!	1																					
70	70		201							1	500208																							
71	71		301							1	Angry Bear	It doesn't matter if we get corrupted or not! As long as we can wake Amberia and free her, we'll go through anything!	1																					
72	72		301								Angry Bear	We're just... trying to free Amberia from her nightmare.	1																					
73	73		201							1	500091
