6	6		301									After finishing their last meal, all medical staff gather to the edge of the base. There is an exit that goes directly to the outer sea.																						
7	7		301									It's raining outside. The sky is dark and gloomy, just like the future that mankind is about to face.																						
8	8		301									The researchers stand in rain, holding umbrellas. In front of the team is Lustrous, as well as Lamia, who has already walked into water.																						
9	9		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The only light on the water comes from the outer buildings of Atlantis in the distance. It looks like wavering fireflies.

11	11		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Lustrous	Lamia, you have proven your value.																						
12	12		301								Lustrous	We have decided to send you into the outer sea.																						
13	13		301								Lustrous	Your duty is to collect data, and come back to notify us if—although quite unlikely—the Punishing disaster has ended and peace is restored to the world.																						
14	14		301								Lamia	Will do.																						
15	15		301								Lustrous	That's all. Do you have anything to say?																						
16	16		301									What to say? To whom?																						
17	17		301									Lamia is confused.																						
18	18		301								Lustrous	Looks like you don't. What about you?																						
19	19		301									She turns back and looks at the medical department.																						
20	20		301									The medical director takes one step forward.																						
21	21		301								Medical Director	There's nothing else we can do for you. You can go, Lamia.																						
22	22		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Lamia takes a good look at everybody. Behind them is the sky-scraping, metal-gray Atlantis. Its top has almost merged with the dark clouds in the sky.

27	27		301									She makes a big splash, creating ripples on the surface.																						
28	28		301									Lamia disappears in the vision before the water settles down. She has left without a moment's hesitation—Atlantis is definitely not a place that she wants to stay.																						
29	29		301									Moments later.

35	35		301							1	Lustrous	What are you laughing about?	2																					
36	36		301								Medical Director	Nothing. I just thought of a story in the Bible.	1																					
37	37		301								Medical Director	When the waters of the Great Flood finally subsided, Noah sent a dove, who later returned with an olive branch. He then knew the ground was dry enough.	1																					
38	38		301								Medical Director	We just sent out our dove.	1																					
39	39		204							2	8																							
40	40		301								Lustrous	I'm afraid she won't find the olive branch, and we won't survive till the flood is over.	2																					
41	41		301								Medical Director	At least we gave her a purpose.	1																					
42	42		204							2																								
43	43		301								Lustrous	I don't think such a frail and weak girl would remember her "purpose."	2																					
44	44		301								Medical Director	Not necessarily. A purpose is better than none.	1																					
45	45		301								Lustrous	You have been taking care of that child.	2																					
46	46		301								Medical Director	Not really taking care. I just kept her healthy.	1																					
47	47		301								Lustrous	Why? I didn't give that duty to you or anyone else.	2																					
48	48		301								Medical Director	I don't know either. I just couldn't watch her die.	1																					
49	49		301								Lustrous	Is that why you prepared the operation for her?	2																					
50	50		301								Medical Director	Not entirely. Can I ask why you decided to save her in the first place?	1																					
51	51		301								Lustrous	Because she's a human.	2																					
52	52		301								Medical Director	It's probably the same reason for me.	1																					
53	53		301								Lustrous	That child isn't smart. In fact, she is quite dull.	2																					
54	54		301								Medical Director	Right. She is slow in reaction and very emotional. I see no outstanding potential in her.	1																					
55	55		301								Lustrous	And very weak. She can't even help in physical duties. It must be exhausting to take care of such an incapable little thing.	2																					
56	56		301								Medical Director	Not really. To be honest, she is so incapable that she can't even create real troubles.	1																					
57	57		301								Lustrous	She once stormed my office and shouted at me, because I didn't let her take away a photo of her mother.	2																					
58	58		301								Medical Director	Did she? But isn't that a normal reaction from a child that misses her mother?	1																					
59	59		301								Lustrous	Maybe. I have been away from a "normal" human society for too long.	2																					
60	60		301								Medical Director	There isn't any "normal" human society left.	1																					
61	61		301								Lustrous	She does have something we lack.	2																					
62	62		301								Medical Director	What is it?	1																					
63	63		301								Lustrous	Weakness.	2																					
64	64		301								Medical Director	That isn't good.	1																					
65	65		301								Lustrous	But that is what defines a "normal person." Atlantis is a fortress, and we are prepared to die here fighting. But she... was only involved in this war by accident. She could not choose where she was born and grew up.	2																					
66	66		301								Medical Director	I once felt that she reminded me of something. Something that I gave up long ago before entering Atlantis.	1																					
67	67		301								Lustrous	It's strange, isn't it? She was foolish, gutless, hesitant, even stubborn... But we could never give up on her completely and just watch her die.	2																					
68	68		301								Medical Director	Most people are like that.	1																					
69	69		301								Lustrous	Which is why the world outside Atlantis has gone to destruction.	2																					
70	70		301								Medical Director	But we are working here to save the future of those people.	1																					
71	71		301								Lustrous	The surgery and this "gather information" purpose... They were just your excuses, weren't they?	2																					
72	72		301									The Medical Director laughs bitterly.																						
73	73		301								Medical Director	I know I can't hide it from you.	1																					
74	74		301								Lustrous	The only purpose of that surgery was to make sure she could survive in a world wrecked by the Punishing Virus. There was no other way to save her. She must go out there and survive on her own. It's up to her how far she can get.	2																					
75	75		301								Medical Director	Sounds like you never expected her to come back and tell us the water is gone.	1																					
76	76		301								Lustrous	Of course. Even if the Punishing disaster ends one day, we won't live to see it.	2																					
77	77		301								Medical Director	Haha, maybe you still can. We don't have much time left.	1																					
78	78		301									Lustrous turns around and looks at her colleague.																						
79	79		301									He stares back with a calm and prepared look.																						
80	80		301								Lustrous	I'm going back to work. Is there anything else you want to say?	2																					
81	81		301									The medical director gazes at the gloomy sky outside the corridor. There seems to be a little moonlight shining through the far horizon, giving the sky a barely visible silver lining.																						
82	82		301								Medical Director	Ma'am, I am sorry. But I have to say this.	1																					
83	83		301								Medical Director	Honestly, I am tired of this view. But I still wish I can live to see it one more time.	1																					
84	84		301								Medical Director	When I watched that kid struggle in the water, I was thinking to myself, that it was a good thing to be alive.	1																					
85	85		301								Medical Director	To be alive means I can feel sorrow, pain and anger. I can give my best for tomorrow.	1																					
86	86		301								Medical Director	Rationally, I am already prepared. I know this is the best solution and there is no other choice.	1																					
87	87		301								Medical Director	But... just like that kid, I don't want to die.	1																					
88	88		301								Medical Director	We aren't devoid of weakness. We were just forced to "send" it away.	1
