6	4		301							1	Rosetta	Amberia... Just like the records, no—even more terrifying...	1																					
7	5		301									The grotesque form of Amberia in "person," is the direct embodiment of her terrifying image in the past tales.																						
8	1002		201							1	500165	1																						
9	6		301							1	Lamia	Oh, you squirmed your way in here after all... How troublesome...	1																					
10	1003		302								Where is Atiel?	7	We're here to stop you from turning on Amberia.	8																				
11	7	9	301								Lamia	Atiel... Is she not standing right before you?	1																					
12	8	9	301								Lamia	Why do you keep doing pointless things?	1																					
13	9		301								Lamia	...Atiel, are you done yet?	1																					
14	10		301									Lamia sighs and raises her head, staring at Amberia beside her.																						
15	1004		201							1	500209																							
16	11		301			RImgBg1Shake				1	Amberia	Not yet. I still need... more power...	1

18	12		301							1	Rosetta	Commandant, that voice... She's...	1																					
19	1006		302								Atiel.	13																						
20	13		301									Though intermittent and garbled, it is undoubtedly Atiel's voice.																						
21	14		301								Rosetta	Why would Amberia sound like Atiel...? And, did Amberia already wake up?	1

24	15		301							1	Lamia	Ew, so many questions at once... But no matter... I'm just going through with my end of the agreement with Atiel.	2																					
25	16		301								Rosetta	Agreement...?	1																					
26	17		301								Lamia	She'll find me a way to control Amberia without using the Punishing Virus, and I'll ensure her safety so she could exact revenge on the ARU.	2																					
27	18		301								Rosetta	Revenge...? Atiel, why...	1																					
28	1009		202							1	2																							
29	1010		201							1	500209																							
30	19		301							1	Amberia (Atiel)	Hah... I should be asking you Forest Guards instead—Why are you helping the ARU?	1																					
31	20		301								Amberia (Atiel)	You have suffered such injustice and were even called sinners. Why? Why do you still stand by these scum of the earth?	1																					
32	21		301								Amberia (Atiel)	What reason do you have to protect them?	1																					
33	1011		201							1	500214	4																						
34	22		301							1	Rosetta	That shouldn't concern you. Aren't you a Construct from Babylonia?	1																					
35	1012		201							1	500209																							
36	23		301							1	Amberia (Atiel)	I am a deserter of the ARU. A "sinner." Like that Forest Guard Diana, I am a descendant of those researchers in the past!	1																					
37	1013		302								Then why are you in Babylonia?	2000	So is that why you're familiar with that lab?	26																				
38	2000	24	201							1	500214	4																						
39	24	25	301							1	Rosetta	She must have been part of those that escaped. Commandant, do you remember about the roadblocks outside of the lab?	1																					
40	25	1015	301								Rosetta	Those were actually for stopping "sinners" from escaping. But even so, many people got out.	1																					
41	26	27	301								Amberia (Atiel)	...Sharp eye, huh, 【kuroname】? But had I not done that, Lamia would've acquired the code first.	1																					
42	27	1015	301								Amberia (Atiel)	And I'd have lost my bargaining chip.	1																					
43	1015		201							1	500209																							
44	29		301							1	Amberia (Atiel)	...I still remember what happened then. Angry mobs of people rushed into my home, tied me up and sent me to that dreadful building.	1																					
45	30		301								Amberia (Atiel)	Screams of agony could be heard day and night... Several of us managed to steal weapons from the guards. We thought we could find some small boat on the shore to escape on.	1																					
46	31		301								Amberia (Atiel)	In the end, I was the only one left. Everyone else was caught during their escape. I didn't dare look back. I abandoned all of them, and I got out.	1																					
47	32		301								Amberia (Atiel)	But when I finally found freedom, I learned that something called the Punishing Virus is destroying the world. In order to live, I had to no choice but to become a Construct.	1																					
48	33		301								Amberia (Atiel)	And I fought, carefully, trying to stay alive in my operations... until I finally managed to seize this chance.	1																					
49	34		301								Amberia (Atiel)	...The chance to return to this hellhole for vengeance!	1																					
50	35		301								Amberia (Atiel)	Without the ARU, I no longer have to live in fear. If I can destroy them, the Ascendants will protect me.	1																					
51	36		301								Amberia (Atiel)	I want to live... No matter what!	1																					
52	1016		201							1	500214	14																						
53	37		301							1	Rosetta	Atiel... You're also...	1																					
54	1017		302								The Ascendant won't protect you!	2001	Many of those people are innocent!	2002																				
55	2001	38	201							1	500165																							
56	38	39	301							1	Lamia	Okay hold up! I at least keep my promises, alright?! Don't slander me, Gray Raven Commandant. Thanks.	1																					
57	39	7000	301								Lamia	Um, well. Can't say for sure about the others, though...	1																					
58	2002	40	201							1	500209																							
59	40	7000	301							1	Amberia (Atiel)	So what?! Even I was innocent... Who's ever helped me?!	1																					
60	7000		201							1	500209																							
61	41		301			RImgBg1Shake					Amberia (Atiel)	Nggahhhhhhh!	1																					
62	1018		201							1	500165	1																						
63	42		301							1	Lamia	Oh, her M.I.N.D. integration has entered the next stage...? Good.	1																					
64	43		301								Lamia	Atiel, I will now use the "code" to activate your frame. You will be able to control all of the bionics through your M.I.N.D. to destroy the ARU.	1																					
65	44		301									Lamia whips out a recorder, the one that was hanging on Evan's neck, and installs it in a voice amplifying device.

67	1019		302								Stop her, Rosetta!	1020

71	46		301									Rosetta immediately launches an attack. A shock wave from the head of her spear gushes through the air directly at Lamia.

79	51		301			RImgBg1Shake					Rosetta	The voice...	2																					
80	52		301									Unstoppably, Derek's voice reverberates throughout the room. As if heeding the call, the nearby energy transmission pipes begin to glow.																						
81	53		301								Lamia	Atiel, turn these two into mush. I'll go outside and enjoy the ARU vs Bionics finale.	1																					
82	54		301								Lamia	Just the thought of a creator being destroyed by their creation sure is exciting, hehehe...	1

88	56	1030	301								Rosetta	No... I've never encountered an enemy like her before.	2																					
89	57	1030	301								Rosetta	You're right, Commandant!	2
