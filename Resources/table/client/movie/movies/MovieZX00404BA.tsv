32	31		301							1	Lucia	It's a structurally simplistic machine, but it wasn't infected by the Punishing Virus. It must contain some unique technology of the estate.	1																					
33	32		301								Lucia	If we leave it, it'll be controlled by the virus eventually. And with a mechanoid of this prowess... it'll likely be trouble...	1

35	34		301							1	Lee	I agree with Lucia. Even if we get a chance to blow up the estate, we can't be sure that the machine will still be here.	1
