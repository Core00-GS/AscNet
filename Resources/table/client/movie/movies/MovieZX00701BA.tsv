18	16		301								Chrome	Kamui did not betray us!	3																					
19	17		301								Karenina	Those are only your words! He's already corrupted by the virus, it's an insurmountable fact!	2																					
20	18		301								Karenina	I don't have time to waste down here!	2																					
21	19		301								Chrome	Kamui already has a solution. He hasn't shown signs of corruption, and has kept his rationality and consciousness intact. No signs of aggression were displayed as well.	3																					
22	20		301								Chrome	As the leader of the Strike Hawk squad, I choose to believe him.	3

48	46		301							1	Lucia	The Purifying Force has geo info of all Constructs?	2																					
49	47		301								Bianca	I understand your opinions on the Purifying Force—I know we're called "hyenas who hunt their own" behind our back. But we never touch Constructs who do not pose a threat.	1																					
50	48		301								Bianca	And, we do not normally have the authority to access locational signal data. Though it would make our missions a lot easier if we did.	1																					
51	49		301								Bianca	Only in absolute necessity are we allowed access to such data.	1																					
52	50		301								Bianca	No time to waste. I'll take full responsibility for Kamui's case. Gray Raven squad, you may leave now.	1

74	72		301								Bianca	You don't need to do this. I've already made a reasonable compromise. I will keep my end of the promise.	1																					
75	73		301								Chrome	No, it's not that I don't trust you. But considering the part about the unknown energy, support in the scale of the Gray Raven squad is necessary.	3																					
76	74		301								Bianca	Very well. We don't have the time for a debate anyway. Follow us if you're coming.	1
