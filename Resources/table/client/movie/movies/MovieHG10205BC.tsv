12	12		301								Liv	Lucia is not coming today, she said that she will wait at the base for the end of your isolation.	1																					
13	13		204							1																								
14	14		301								Liv	And she said something like "I don't want the commandant to get worried."	1																					
15	15		301								Liv	But I get where she's coming from. After all...	1																					
16	16		301								Liv	You aren't just some captain or a leader to us.	1

28	28		301								α	Is this your relationship with the Constructs?	1																					
29	29		302								Maybe.	30																						
30	30		301								α	The Constructs are "artificial weapons" designed to fight against the Punishing Virus after all.	1																					
31	31		301								α	It sounds stupid to befriend weapons.	1																					
32	32		302								You're a Construct too, are you not?	33																						
33	33		301								α	Yes, so I never want to be anyone's friend.	1																					
34	34		301								α	Weapons should stay weapons. No less. No more.	1
