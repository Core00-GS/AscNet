6	6		301									I heard that line back in the King's palace. He repeated it once again when we arrived, just like a normal NPC.																						
7	7		301									In front of us was a huge, empty space. The strange-looking building in the center was probably the hidden Demon King's Castle.

12	12		301								Liv	Commandant! Everybody!	2																					
13	13		301								Camu	Don't move. I won't let you interfere with the plan.	3

15	15		301									Vera and Camu were standing next to the King, along with Liv, who had a mysterious black circle around her wrists.																						
16	16		301									From what Camu said, that circle was probably a shackle.

22	22		301									Kamui immediately walked up after seeing Camu and started taunting, but the latter only shook his head with disdain.																						
23	23		301									Lee stopped Kamui as the King slowly walked forward.

25	25		301							1	King	I'm going to repeat this, heroes. I don't want to, and I won't hurt you.	1																					
26	26		201							1	500113																							
27	27		301							1	Demon King	But you want to destroy this world, don't you?	1																					
28	28		201							1	500011																							
29	29		301							1	King	Oh, Demon King... I didn't know you would become such a freak. If only I could have found out earlier, you wouldn't be able to meet the heroes.	1																					
30	30		301								King	Even without me, others will still stand up against you once they find out about your plan...	1																					
31	31		301								King	But nobody will know. In this endless cycle with the name of game, only two of us have realized the truth of the world.	1																					
32	32		301								King	Oh, and these heroes, of course.	1																					
33	33		302								Are you really going to destroy the world?	34	But we want to protect the world.	35																				
34	34	36	301								King	It's true. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate living in the game world as a game character, because that's just my destiny.	1																					
35	35		301								King	To protect this world... That sounds like something heroes will say, 【kuroname】.	1																					
36	36		301								King	But I don't want to accept the rules of this world. I will no longer be a puppet of the system, repeating the meaningless dialogues again and again!	1																					
37	37		201							1	500173																							
38	38		301							1	Lee	I see. You don't want to be limited, and want to become a real, independent AI. Is that right?	1																					
39	39		201							1	500011																							
40	40		301							1	King	Correct. The Goddess' artifact will grant me this power to reach beyond this game world!	1																					
41	41		201							1	500173																							
42	42		301							1	Lee	How is that even possible? Do you really think an object within the game can have any impact on the bottom layer code?	1																					
43	43		201							1	500011																							
44	44		301							1	King	Of course it can. That's exactly what the Goddess did.	1																					
45	45		302								Is the Goddess real?	46	Are you kidding?	47																				
46	46	48	301								King	Of course. That's how this world runs!	1																					
47	47		301								King	Whatever you think. In the end, I'm the only one who really knows what to do!	1																					
48	48		301								King	I will destroy this world with my new power, and create it again based on my own rules. I will become the new Goddess and break away from the system!	1																					
49	49		201							1	500166	6																						
50	50		301							1	Lucia	Hmm... I get what you are saying, but I just found a problem.	1
