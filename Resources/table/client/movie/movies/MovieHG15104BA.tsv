3	3		301									3:35 p.m., Command Central Office, Council Building																						
4	4		302								(Knock on door)	5																						
5	5		301								??	Come in.																						
6	111		401							2	1516																							
7	6		301									You enter the office to see Hassen flipping through files at his desk.																						
8	7		301									...You notice Asimov's sloppy handwriting on some of the papers. Those must be the records from your previous failed simulation.																						
9	8		201							1	500011																							
10	9		301							1	Hassen	Ah. Good afternoon, Gray Raven Commandant. Have you had a good rest these few days?	1																					
11	10		302								Pretty good.	11	Not good at all.	12																				
12	11	14	301								Hassen	You young people sure are energetic.	1																					
13	12		301								Hassen	You gotta be confident in yourself, young one! I trust that you'll be able to take on other jobs soon, right?	1																					
14	13		302								...Yeah.	14																						
15	14		301								Hassen	I'd like to talk to you about your experience in simulated missions with Camu via remote connection and what you think about it.	1																					
16	15		301								Hassen	I'll get straight to the point. The Council had a meeting over the data collected in your previous simulation.	1																					
17	16		301								Hassen	I have two things I'd like to discuss.	1																					
18	17		301								Hassen	First, the previous few simulated missions were indeed tougher—or, if I should say, they targeted Camu's weak spots especially. I'm sure you've noticed.	1																					
19	18		302								Yeah. You wanted to find out his limits.	19																						
20	19		301								Hassen	It might seem cruel of us, but if we can't pinpoint and deal with the weak points during training, things would only get worse in a real battle.	1																					
21	20		302								I understand.	21	You're being too hard on him.	21																				
22	21		301								Hassen	We've adjusted the battle plans accordingly.	1																					
23	22		301								Hassen	We want to make sure that Camu deserves to be on the team despite all the risks he brings.	1																					
24	23		301								Hassen	That's why we want to reconfirm this.	1																					
25	24		301								Hassen	Commandant 【kuroname】, are you still willing to continue working with Camu in combat via remote M.I.N.D. connection?	1																					
26	25		302								He's an excellent fighter...	26																						
27	26		302								And trustworthy.	27																						
28	27		301								Hassen	...Is that your answer?	1																					
29	28		301								Hassen	I see.	1																					
30	29		301								Hassen	Before you leave, I have one more thing to say.	1																					
31	30		301								Hassen	I made the right choice assigning him to you, 【kuroname】.	1																					
32	31		302								I hope so.	32																						
33	32		301								Hassen	Perhaps you'd like to hear HIS choice.	1																					
34	33		302								His choice?	34																						
35	34		202							1																								
36	35		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Hassen simply smiles in his usual benevolent way and gestures at you to close the door when you leave.																						
37	36		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory17.jpg																								
38	37		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The corridor is empty. If your memory serves you, Camu should be in the office on the opposite side.																						
39	38		302								(Wait for him)	39	(Leave)	40																				
40	39	41	301									You have just decided to wait when the office door opens.																						
41	40		301									You are about to leave when the office door opens.																						
42	41		401							2	1516																							
43	42		301				DialogDisable					Camu comes striding out. The mild annoyance on his face is replaced by a constrained expression.																						
44	43		201						1500	1	500175																							
45	44		301			DialogEnable				1	Camu	What did they say to you?	1																					
46	45		302								They asked where you went last night.	46	They asked if I wanted to keep working with you.	54																				
47	46		301								Camu	O-Oh?	1																					
48	47		202							1																								
49	48		301									Camu stares at you in suspicion.																						
50	49		201							1	500175																							
51	50		301							1	Camu	And what did you tell them?	1																					
52	51		302								I said you were with me.																							
53	52		301								Camu	?	1																					
54	53		302								Heh, just kidding.	56																						
55	54		301								Camu	That's what I thought.	1																					
56	55		202							1																								
57	56		301									Camu squints. Looks like he has already guessed the topic of your meeting.																						
58	57		201							1	500175																							
59	58		301							1	Camu	Hey. What did you tell them?	1																					
60	59		302								I declined, of course.	60	I agreed, of course.	70																				
61	60		301									Camu freezes, as if not expecting such a direct answer. It's rare to see him so baffled.																						
62	61		301								Camu	...So you gave up on me, huh.	1																					
63	62		301								Camu	Revolting. And you were spouting all those pretty words yesterday...	1																					
64	63		302								I was kidding.	64																						
65	64		301								Camu	Do you really think I—uh, what?	1																					
66	65		302								I agreed.	66																						
67	66		204							1	5																							
68	67		301								Camu	...Hey! Are you ******* trying to die? Playing with me like that?	1																					
69	68		301									Camu looks genuinely enraged.																						
70	69		302								My bad, my bad.	70	I was just joking.	70																				
71	70		301							1	Camu	You won't find anyone better than me anyway.	1																					
72	71		302								What did you choose, then?	72																						
73	72		301								Camu	Is that important?	1																					
74	73		302								Of course.	74	Just interested in your answer.	74																				
75	74		301								Camu	Enough. I'm not falling for that again!	1																					
76	75		301								Camu	I already agreed to cooperate from the time being. I'd rather you hone your skills a bit instead of acting like my therapist.	1																					
77	76		302								Can we train together again?	77	Can we eat together again?	78																				
78	77	80	301								Camu	Of course. I want to shut that creepy nerd up with an impressive performance.	1																					
79	78		301								Camu	Of course. You owe me.	1																					
80	79		302								When did I ever owe you—forget it.	80																						
81	80		302								So I'll see you tomorrow in the training room, huh?	81																						
82	81		204							1	1																							
83	82		301								Camu	You'd better not be late. I hate waiting.	1																					
84	83		302								You're the one who's always late...	84																						
85	84		301								Camu	I'm not the one asking you to come, though.	1																					
86	85		302								I'll be on time.	86																						
87	86		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Camu	You'd better be.	1
