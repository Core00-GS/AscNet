5	5		302								Remember that tiny robot you gave me...?	6	O-oh, nothing. I was just looking around...	7																				
6	6	8	301								Lee	Is something wrong?	1																					
7	7		301								Lee	Did that tiny robot break?	1																					
8	8		301								Lee	Not surprised. After all, it was assembled out of recycled Corrupted parts dating back to the last century...	1																					
9	9		301								Lee	It's about at the end of its life expectancy anyway.	1																					
10	10		301								Lee	Did you bring it? I'll run some tests on it.	1																					
11	11		302								I got it right here.	12

13	13		301								Lee	I've replaced some of the scrapped parts. But the core chip is too old, and the workshop doesn't have any spares.	1																					
14	14		302								Do we have to go kill more Corrupted?	15	What should we do?	16																				
15	15	17	301								Lee	We can't get this type of chip from dismantling Corrupted. However...	1																					
16	16		301								Lee	If you really can't go without it...	1																					
17	17		301								Lee	I know where we can buy one.	1																					
18	18		302								Awesome!	19	I'll go get one right now!	20																				
19	19	21	301								Lee	Don't get your hopes up just yet. Do you know what kind of chip?	1																					
20	20		301								Lee	Wait a second. You know what kind of chip to buy?	1																					
21	21		302								Um...	22	Can't you just go with me?	22																				
22	22		301								Lee	Constructs can only leave if we're on a mission. You'll need to submit an application to your superior if you want me to go with you. Are you sure?	1																					
23	23		302								If that's what it takes for you to go with me.	24	I don't have any other choice.	24
