15	15		301								Chrome	Murray? What happened?	1																					
16	16		301								Murray	To put it simply, you, the enemy, and Gray Raven have all stepped into a trap when entering the main control room, and you're now all trapped in the M.I.N.D. of the computing system, Huaxu.	2																					
17	17		301								Chrome	So if this is the virtual M.I.N.D. of the system... what was that we saw?	1																					
18	18		301								Murray	Likely a facade Huaxu created. Good thing I have experience dealing with things like this.	2																					
19	19		301								Chrome	Were you the one who opened the exit just now?	1

43	37		301							1	Huaxu	I never asked to control anyone. I'm only a dream-making machine. You're searching for Gestalt, so all I did was show you Gestalt's power.	1

49	41		301							1	Huaxu	Indeed. The real Gestalt is likely far more powerful. I am but a lesser duplicate. So...	1																					
50	42		301								Huaxu	Let us battle. Defeat me, and I will bring you where you need to go.	1																					
51	43		301								Huaxu	...Please. Free this ship. End the dream.	1

55	46		201							1	500144																							
56	47		301							1	Chaofeng	Perhaps we've all got it wrong... What's controlling the ship and bringing about all this chaos is Lady Qu herself... and Huaxu is but a computing system.	1
