10	9		301								Chrome	How many times have I told you, Kamui... Be patient and prudent while on standby.	2																					
11	10		301								Kamui	But hey, even the Gray Ravens are roosting over there.	1																					
12	11		202							1	2																							
13	12		301									Kamui points to where Liv and Lucia are standing. Lucia, as always, is carefully studying the surroundings. Liv, on the other hand, seems a bit excited by the sight of the sea.																						
14	7788		301									On an unrelated note, Pulao gifted Lucia the stage costume from before.																						
15	13		301									Liv is leaning against the ledge. One hand on the taffrail, the other stretching out to the sea as if fishing for something.																						
16	14		301									At Lucia's hint, Liv notices the gaze from everyone. A blush slowly creeps over her petrified face.

22	20		301								Chrome	Until the ship reaches the shore, we cannot let our guard down. Commandant, could you please keep your people on their toes?	2																					
23	21		302								Let's get some rest while we can.	100	Yeah, I guess we should get ready.	24

26	23	26	301								Chrome	...Very well. I respect your decision.	2

31	28		301							1	Yazi	I am terribly sorry. We're still fixing up the previous "system malfunction," so we cannot dock just yet. We hope you're doing okay on the ship.	1																					
32	30		301									The figure walking over is Yazi, a member of Kowloong Crew. Once an enemy, but after the death of Villier, she confessed her wrongdoings, even offering to make up for it.

36	34		301							1	Lee	Well, at least this time we're not surrounded by enemies, so that's a plus. I suppose you're done getting things back in order on the ship?	2																					
37	35		301								Yazi	Only halfway or so. Pulao and the others are still busy patching things up. I came here to check if you needed anything.	1																					
38	36		301								Lee	Well, in that case, let's talk about something that's on top of everyone's mind. You're absolutely sure we're headed for that "city," right?	2																					
39	37		301								Yazi	Yes, the ship will return to its true course as soon as the system comes back online. You will see the real Kowloong soon.	1																					
40	38		302								Are there still people living there?	39	What kind of place is it?	40																				
41	39		301								Yazi	We may have been gone for a while, but according to the details in the other plan, Kowloong is built to last.	1																					
42	40		301								Yazi	An urban fortress where cultural relics and important technologies are preserved.	1																					
43	41		201							2	1021001		-400																					
44	42		301							1	Lucia	Have you made contact with Kowloong since you restored the system? Say, reporting to them about your return...?	2																					
45	43		301								Yazi	About that...	1																					
46	44		201							2	1081001		-400																					
47	45		301							1	Kamui	Ay, don't pause on that! The place can't be usurped like this ship or sumthin', can it?	2																					
48	46		301							1	Yazi	That would be an unlikely scenario. It is only that our messages are all met with silence.	1																					
49	47		201							2	500155		-400																					
50	48		301							1	Chrome	I don't mean to offend, but I'd assume you wouldn't make an elementary mistake like... messing up the channel frequency.	2																					
51	49		301								Yazi	Naturally. We matched up everyone's database to reconfirm. The frequency is correct.	1																					
52	50		301								Chrome	If that is indeed the case, then something must be going on at our destination.	2																					
53	51		202							1	2																							
54	52		301								Crew Member	Lady Yazi, we found a usable port!																						
55	53		301									A sudden message from the loudspeaker interrupts the conversation and draws everyone's attention to the port the ship is approaching.																						
56	54		201							1	500155																							
57	55		301							1	Chrome	Looks like a thorough investigation is in order. Might I ask for your squad's assistance, Gray Raven's commandant?	1																					
58	56		302								Sure, let's stick together.	57	What do you think, Lucia?	58																				
59	57	60	301								Chrome	This way, with the help of Gray Raven, we can better handle any emergencies that might arise.	1																					
60	58		201							1	1021001																							
61	59		301							1	Lucia	It's not safe to split up. Commandant, we should go with Chrome and his team.	1

63	61		301									An almost animalistic siren peals through the ship, drowning out everyone's voices and the jitters of the crewmates.
