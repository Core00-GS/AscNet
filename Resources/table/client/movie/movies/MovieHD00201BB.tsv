4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Asimov	You're on time for once. Looks like you've had some time to reflect, huh?	1																					
5	5		301								Asimov	So do you know why I called you here?	1																					
6	6		302								Yep, pretty much...	7	Babel Tower?	7																				
7	7		301								Asimov	Good. Spares me the effort to explain.	1																					
8	8		301								Asimov	We've now entered the fourth stage of "Project Babel". You will still be in charge of testing it.	1																					
9	9		302								Yep. Been there, done that.	10																						
10	10		301								Asimov	Anyway, just relax. I want the combat data to be as accurate as possible. You'll ruin it if you take it too much to heart.	1																					
11	11		301								Asimov	Oh, just one little new thing before the test.	1																					
12	12		302								What new thing?	13																						
13	13		301								Asimov	We've expanded the combat squad options this time. You can change your roster according to the fights.	1																					
14	14		301								Asimov	I'm sure you'll find it beneficial.	1																					
15	15		301								Asimov	After all, if memory serves me right, you've frequently commanded temporary squads to carry out combat missions to great success.	1																					
16	16		302								Oh, I just got lucky...	17																						
17	17		301								Asimov	Oh, and don't forget, you can adjust the overall combat intensity according to your own needs.	1																					
18	18		301								Asimov	But I'm sure you'll be able to handle the hardest difficulty. Want me to set the default to the hardest?	1																					
19	19		302								Just let me customize inside!	20																						
20	20		301								Asimov	Alright then. Any battle intensity works, I'll be able to collect more data comprehensively.	1																					
21	21		301								Asimov	Well, I've told you everything you need to know. I'll tell you the rest inside the tower.	1																					
22	22		301								Asimov	Hopefully, you can provide more useful combat data to make all this overtime worthwhile.	1																					
23	23		302								Me too...	24
