4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Liv	Why do we still have to fight... We already defeated the King...	1																					
5	5		301									Liv was in grief after the Demon King made her announcement. They had been moving together ever since she joined the game. To her, the Demon King was already a friend.																						
6	6		201							1	500166	6																						
7	7		301							1	Lucia	But that is the Demon King's wish, isn't it?	1																					
8	8		201							1	500174																							
9	9		301							1	Liv	...Yes.	1																					
10	10		301									Just like what Lucia said, the Demon King had no idea for power or anything. She even asked us to "stop" her.																						
11	11		301									There must be a purpose.																						
12	12		302								We must complete the game...	13	This will be the last fight.	15																				
13	13		201							1	500173																							
14	14	17	301							1	Lee	I think so too. But we probably need to ask herself for the real reason.	1																					
15	15		201							1	500180	5																						
16	16		301							1	Karenina	Let's finish her off and go back.	1																					
17	17		201							1	500181	1																						
18	18		301							1	Vera	Before facing the Demon King, how about we have a fight to decide the winner first?	1																					
19	19		301									Camu and Vera stopped and pointed their weapons toward us.																						
20	20		301								Vera	Before entering the game, we said this would be a race. Looking at the situation, it's no longer possible to decide the winner.	1																					
21	21		301								Vera	That's why I'd like to propose a change in the rules. Let's fight right here, and the winners have the right to challenge the Demon King.	1																					
22	22		201							1	500174																							
23	23		301							1	Liv	But we don't know the real power of the Demon King. What if we don't have sufficient strength to face the Demon King after this battle...	1																					
24	24		201							1	500181	1																						
25	25		301							1	Vera	Easy. If you win, you can order us to join you, because you are the winners.	1																					
26	26		201							1	500173																							
27	27		301							1	Lee	Is that what you have been planning, Vera...?	1																					
28	28		301									Camu and Vera were very particular about winning or losing. Although they never thought they would lose, Vera had put an extra insurance in place just in case.																						
29	29		302								You will win either way. How cunning, Vera.	30	Make sure you give everything you have.	32																				
30	30		201							1	500181	1																						
31	31	34	301							1	Vera	Whether you agree or not, we have decided to end it here.	1																					
32	32		201							1	500181	1																						
33	33		301							1	Vera	Have you realized that we had been cruising along? No wonder you were top of your class.	1																					
34	34		201							1	500166																							
35	35		301							1	Lucia	I still don't think we should "decide" the winning team here, but it seems a fight is unavoidable.	1																					
36	36		201							1	500173																							
37	37		301							1	Lee	It's player versus player time then.	1																					
38	38		201							1	500180	6																						
39	39		301							1	Karenina	Wait a sec, which side should I join then?	1																					
40	40		302								Oh, I need to make a decision too...	41	Can you stay with me?	42																				
41	41	43	301								Karenina	Yeah, we were in Vera's team...	1																					
42	42		301								Karenina	Do you have no shame!?	1																					
43	43		201							1	500176																							
44	44		301							1	Camu	Just stay in Kamui's team. You are nothing but liabilities.	1																					
45	45		201							1	500180	5																						
46	46		301							1	Karenina	How dare you call me a liability!? You arrogant, dark, narcissistic piece of ****!	1																					
47	47		201							1	500176																							
48	48		301							1	Camu	What!?	1																					
49	49		201							1	1081001	2																						
50	50		301							1	Kamui	Hah...	1																					
51	51		201							1	500176																							
52	52		301							1	Camu	What are you laughing at, Kamui?!	1																					
53	53		201							1	500181	1																						
54	54		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Vera	Alright, let's do this. We don't have much time left.	1
