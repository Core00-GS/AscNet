41	41		301							1	Hassen	These elite squads have been able to protect most of the crew during ambushes.	1																					
42	42		301								Hassen	However, the Hetero-Creatures are becoming increasingly relentless. Even our elite forces are struggling to prevent losses during air transit.	1																					
43	43		301									The line graph continues to sink in front of the camera to the lowest point of the dataset.																						
44	44		301								Hassen	As shown in the figure, the success rate of our rescue operations continues to decline with each passing day. We have tried various tactics and even resorted to autonomous rescue pods, but there is no obvious change.	1																					
45	45		301								Hassen	They are in a state of insurrection and will attack everything within range.	1																					
46	46		301								Hassen	According to our latest statistics, our success rate has fallen below 3.12% for 12 consecutive days.	1																					
47	47		301								Hassen	The cost of these rescue operations in terms of Constructs, materials, and transportation continues to escalate.	1																					
48	48		301								Hassen	Without an intact transport craft, even the elite teams currently stranded on the surface are unable to return to Babylonia.	1

94	94		301								Lucia	We have successfully cleared the Hetero-Creatures from the Pulia Forest Park Ruins and have fully evacuated outside of the corruption zone.	1																					
95	95		301								Lucia	There is a high level of Punishing concentration here due to the large presence of Hetero-Creatures.	1																					
96	96		301								Lucia	According to the information we have received, the surrounding areas are the same except in the direction leading to the ARU.	1																					
97	97		301								Lucia	However, we are unable to escort this many refugees by foot, nor does the ARU have enough supplies to sustain such a high influx of refugees.	1																					
98	98		301								Lucia	After we confirmed that the twins headed toward the west coast, we took the commandant and 67 humans to the basement in City 043's conservation area.	1

113	113		301							1	Liv	Fortunately, the commandant's abdominal wound didn't affect any vital organs. However, during the evacuation, the commandant suffered a serious head injury, leading to brain trauma and subdural hematoma.	1																					
114	114		301								Liv	After we moved to the conservation area of City 043, we used the medical facilities here to perform a craniotomy on the commandant and removed the hematoma.	1																					
115	115		301								Liv	While we were searching for a conservation area to operate in, we were delayed after being attacked by a barrage of Hetero-Creatures. Now the situation isn't looking good. The commandant's in a coma and battling an infection.	1																					
116	116		301								Liv	The medical equipment here is less than ideal and most of the medical supplies have been taken away. If this continues, the commandant may face septic shock.	1																					
117	117		301								Liv	Hopefully, we can bring the commandant back to Babylonia for treatment, but based on the current safety concerns in transit, I'm afraid that even if we make it back, the turbulence will only cause secondary injuries to the commandant.	1																					
118	118		301								Liv	We need immediate medical relief. Whether that be for the commandant or the injured residents here in City 043's conservation area.	1

141	141		301								Nikola	Egret and numerous other Constructs are still stranded on the surface.	2																					
142	142		301								Nikola	If even Gray Raven and 【kuroname】 have suffered such serious losses, this will be a huge blow to the people's confidence in victory.	2																					
143	143		301								Nikola	At that point, I'm sure even more people will be in favor of abandoning the rescue effort.	2																					
144	144		301								Hassen	If we don't inform the people, they will only turn to rumors. Sometimes, acceptance is more helpful for us to overcome difficulties.	1																					
145	145		301								Nikola	But surely we approach this in a more delicate manner.	2																					
146	146		301								Hassen	What if I say I wanted to use this as a bargaining chip with Kurono?	1																					
147	147		301								Nikola	You mean the Omega File?	2																					
148	148		301								Hassen	Correct. According to the Science Council's report, the "Omega Prototype" is complete.	1																					
149	149		301								Hassen	It has the ability to absorb the Punishing Virus, but the effect is limited.	1																					
150	150		301								Hassen	Given the information in the report, it seems that it can't actively capture the Punishing Virus. However, it can still absorb it by coming into contact with the virus.	1																					
151	151		301								Hassen	Considering its current form, even if we devote all resources to mass production, it's going to be difficult to achieve the desired effect.	1																					
152	152		301								Hassen	However, if we can direct large quantities of the Punishing Virus to the "Omega Prototype", we may be able to achieve a vastly different effect.	1																					
153	153		301								Nikola	How can Constructs absorb the Punishing Virus? Isn't that a characteristic reserved for Ascendants?	2																					
154	154		301								Nikola	...You aren't thinking of joining forces with Kurono, are you?	2																					
155	155		301								Hassen	The Science Council stole a portion of Kurono's R&D through its counter intelligence program. They're using Ascendant data to develop a specialized frame.	1																					
156	156		301								Hassen	If Asimov can confirm the Omega Weapon's compatibility with this new frame...	1

171	171		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Before the abandoned CPF 040 and the Pulia Forest Park were set ablaze, people had noticed the Punishing concentration steadily rising with the appearance of the Red Tide.																						
172	172		301									At that time, people simply attributed this phenomenon to the "Hetero-Core" and the "Red Tide". They believed this was the manifestation of the Punishing Virus as it culminated and evolved, not that they were the culprits.																						
173	173		301									Nobody was aware of a much greater disaster silently looming in the distance. They only targeted the Red Tide, thinking that if it was eliminated, their problems would be solved.																						
174	174		301									Thus, they used the Longinus Arsenal to obliterate the Red Tide and its monstrosities. However, the Punishing Virus still remained. Nothing could dissipate it.																						
175	175		301									Their efforts were akin to evaporating a stream, the condensation of which only returned to the air. The airborne Punishing Virus was then absorbed by the "Mother". What should have been an overflowing Punishing Concentration seemingly fell. During which, it used this time to breed yet another disaster.																						
176	176		301									With the CPF 040 and Pulia Forest Park reduced to ruins, the Punishing Virus trapped within was released into the world, further fanning the flames of a world already at its limit.																						
177	177		301									In this vast red sea, the emergence of humanoid creatures only indicated the further evolution of the Punishing Creatures.																						
178	178		301									However, they are not the greatest threat nor are they the ultimate fruit borne from disaster.																						
179	179		301									Today, the hotbed known as the "Red Tide" continues to sow its "seeds" across the land as it marches onward over bloodstains, both new and old, in the joyous pitter-patter of rain.

209	209		301								Conservation Resident B	Didn't you hear, idiot? Their commandant's head wound can't handle the turbulence.	1																					
210	210		301								Conservation Resident A	I was just thinking... We wait a few days until it's safe, then go back with their commandant! I wasn't expecting it to get worse!	2																					
211	211		301								Conservation Resident B	Then what are you going on about? We stay here... we die. We go on the transport craft... we die. That's all we've got to live for now.	1																					
212	212		301								Conservation Resident A	What the hell are you talking about! We already made it out of danger once already!	2																					
213	213		301			PanelActor2Shake				1	Conservation Resident A	The conservation area in Pulia Forest was a damn deathtrap! The whole place was blown to smithereens... Ka-BOOM!	2																					
214	214		301									He jumps out of bed and mimics the explosion in the ruins.																						
215	215		301								Conservation Resident A	Can't you see? With the Punishing concentration as high as it is, even the refugees living out in the wilderness are fighting to enter the conservation areas. Just look at that guy with the guitar...	2

218	218		301							1	Conservation Resident A	But despite all that, we're still alive!	2																					
219	219		301			PanelActor2Shake				1	Conservation Resident A	AND! We're going to keep on living!	2																					
220	220		301									Despite Chuck's angry glare, he shakes the other resident excitedly as if to cheer himself up by shouting.

227	227		301							1	Conservation Resident A	Where else is there to go down here?	1																					
228	228		301									Chuck doesn't respond. Instead, he just quietly grabs his guitar and proceeds further into the basement.																						
229	229		301								Conservation Resident B	(Sighs) If you've still got this much energy to shout, give me some of your rations tomorrow...	2																					
230	230		301									He pushes him away and sighs quietly. He grabs his injured leg and struggles to adjust his posture.																						
231	231		301								Conservation Resident B	And if you don't got any... Don't we still have protective gear? Heh.	2																					
232	232		301								Conservation Resident A	What's that gonna do? That head wound you got on the way here must've given you a concussion if you think that'll help us kill those monsters... I... I just want...	1																					
233	233		301									His voice suddenly withers. Noticing his partner's dejected mood, the middle-aged man sits up and pats him on the back.																						
234	234		301								Conservation Resident B	...It was just a scrapped CPF a hundred kilometers away that was blown up. That's all. It's nothing serious... It'll be all right.	2																					
235	235		301								Conservation Resident A	If it was just that, then why the hell are we all stuck here?! I... I...	1

237	237		301									Already on the verge of a mental breakdown, the man begins to sob as panic sets in.

239	239		301								Conservation Resident B	Hey... Don't cry... It'll be alright... Um, Doctor... Ah-hem... My head wound...	1																					
240	240		301								Liv	Has the wound opened again? I'll be right with you.																						
241	241		301								Conservation Resident B	Thanks... You haven't had any shuteye the past few days. Have you?	1																					
242	242		301								Liv	Constructs don't need sleep. I can still keep going for a few more days, but you need more rest. And stop irritating your wound.																						
243	243		301								Conservation Resident B	It just... hurts and itches at the same time. I can't help myself...	1																					
244	244		301									The middle-age man gazes up at Liv—dark circles surround his glossy eyes.																						
245	245		301								Conservation Resident B	Hey, snot-nosed brat. Tell me... How many days have we been here...?	1																					
246	246		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					His fatigued and unclear question gets lost in the surrounding noise, yielding no response.
