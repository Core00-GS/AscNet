9	9		301							1	Roland	Wasn't expecting to actually start the ship on my own... I guess the piloting skills I learned for my character back then haven't been completely forgotten.	1																					
10	10		301								Roland	Was that "The Venusian"? Or was it "Dragonfly"... Sigh. It's been too long. My memories aren't as reliable as they were.	1																					
11	11		301									Roland keeps trying to remember, yet all he can recall is that he was not picked as the main character‚Äîhe might have been a talented child actor, but he never could become the lead.																						
12	12		301									Maybe he still cannot be. No one considers him someone worth paying attention to. But why should he care?																						
13	13		301									Even without a script or rehearsals, the moment an actor steps onto the stage... he must embody his role.																						
14	14		301								Roland	If I'm playing the brave knight saving the damsel in distress today, I suppose this spaceship can be my steed? Not too shabby, I say.	1																					
15	15		301									Roland takes out the container in his arms and holds it up, watching how the flesh preserved in the liquid keeps shifting its form.																						
16	16		301								Roland	Unfortunately, they've cast me in a horror story instead of a fairy tale today... I'm the snake that feeds the princess her poisoned apple.	1

24	24		301									As if responding to Roland's words, the hull of the spaceship shakes violently, and the alarms of its defense system go off in every corner of the ship.																						
25	25		301								Roland	Alright, alright, alright... That's more like it‚Äîan emergency lift-off, the sudden appearance of monstrous creatures, a side character left all alone... There's nothing better than the plot of a solid B movie.	1																					
26	26		301									Who knows where Roland was hiding his chain blade and shotgun? He draws his weapons and prepares his stance, ready to face the rapidly descending Hetero-Creatures.
