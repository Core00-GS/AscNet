32	29		301									The entire space station starts trembling vigorously. The connecting joints between compartments slowly disintegrate, layer by layer.

38	34		301								Broadcast	Cells infected by bacteria or viruses will be... destroyed and discarded...																						
39	35		201							1	1031001																							
40	36		301							1	Liv	The broadcast... Does it mean the space station is self-destructing?	1																					
41	37		302								It's the self-defense mechanism.	38	I think so.	38

43	39		301									After a lot of trembling, you look out from the window. Many compartments have already been tossed into space...																						
44	40		301									Some compartments do not have the time to release pressure, and are pushed away instead by their content, including air and Babylonia troops...

46	42		301							1	Watanabe	Like it said, the immune system of the space station was triggered.	1

50	46		301							1	Watanabe	If I'm not wrong...	1																					
51	47		301								Watanabe	You destroyed the space station's observation room and weapon control system, which was akin to disabling its attack and defense functions.	1																					
52	48		301								Watanabe	Now that your troops start to land, they have triggered the immune system "within" the space station.	1																					
53	49		201							1	1011001																							
54	50		301							1	Lee	To it, a temporary disintegration doesn't necessarily mean destruction...	1																					
55	51		301								Lee	Because as long as the gravity core still exists, it can attract and restructure nearby matters like it did in the past...	1																					
56	52		301								Lee	But the integration surely is devastating to us.	1																					
57	53		201							1	500080																							
58	54		301							1	Watanabe	...If we don't do anything, we will probably end up expunged.	1																					
59	55		302								I'm ready.	56	We're not just gonna sit here and wait.	56
