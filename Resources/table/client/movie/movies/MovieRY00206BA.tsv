3	3		301			DialogEnable						Chrome moves his limbs around after entering the virtual space. He looks around the place, intrigued by its similar yet distinct views with Babylonia.

6	6		301							1	Chrome	This is my first time connecting to Gestalt... through this way, nonetheless.	1																					
7	7		302								A backdoor?	8	Virtual space?	8																				
8	8		301								Chrome	Right, I hope this doesn't bring you any troubles in the future.	1																					
9	9		302								I'm used to it.	10																						
10	10		301									You are still getting the hang of being in virtual space, and you see Nanami running around energetically.																						
11	11		301								Nanami	Hmm...? But Nanami remembers that this is where the barrier was!	2																					
12	12		301								Chrome	Nothing around here looks particularly out of the ordinary... Nanami, what are those?	1																					
13	13		301									He approaches the working repair programs to inspect them. They are humanoid in appearance, but Chrome deduces that they are probably not humans... minds of humans, that is.																						
14	14		204							2	1																							
15	15		301								Nanami	They are the automatic repair programs of Gestalt, repairing damaged parts and recovering lost data streams.	2																					
16	16		302								I see.	17																						
17	17		301								Chrome	This rabbit-shaped program as well?	1																					
18	18		301								Nanami	Uh-huh, of course—rabbit?	2																					
19	19		301									Nanami suddenly realizes that the program Chrome is referring to might just be the bugged bunny that led her to the anomaly earlier.																						
20	20		204							2	5																							
21	21		301								Nanami	Bugged bunny! Where is it?!	2																					
22	22		301									In the distance, the bunny-shaped program looks up and notices Nanami, and then it instantly runs away like it did before.																						
23	23		301								Nanami	Quickly! Follow it! Captain Chrome, take Commandant with you!	2

26	26		301								Chrome	My apologies, Commandant.	1																					
27	27		302								(Stop resisting)	28	That's not necessary! I can run!	31																				
28	28		301								Chrome	I'm sorry about this!	1																					
29	29		202							1	2				1																			
30	30	34	301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Before you can react, Chrome has already had you in his arms in a less than dignifying bridal carry, and he speeds up to follow the accelerating Nanami up ahead...																						
31	31		301								Chrome	You're right. A human body won't be that different from a Construct's in the virtual space. Let's quickly follow Nanami, then.	1																					
32	32		202							1	2				1																			
33	33		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You nod at Chrome, and the two of you speed up to follow the accelerating Nanami up ahead...																						
34	34		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory260.png																								
35	35		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Following the speeding Nanami, Chrome and you pass through the hidden barrier and enter the anomaly.																						
36	36		301							 		Even though you are not slow by any measure, your bodies are still altered in the anomaly, and you inevitably lose sight of Nanami.																						
37	37		201							1	500155																							
38	38		301							1	Chrome	This doesn't look different from the virtual space, but this feeling... it's incredibly strange.	1																					
39	39		301									Chrome can feel his frame moving not entirely according to his will. A proper comparison would be a character in the video games that Kamui would play—as if he is controlling his body through a controller.																						
40	40		301								Chrome	Commandant! Are you feeling alright?!	1																					
41	41		302								I think I'm in a similar situation to yours.	42																						
42	42		301									Despite the odd feelings, you still manage to function to a degree.																						
43	43		302								Where is Nanami?	44																						
44	44		301								Chrome	She was way ahead of us and disappeared with the "bunny."	1																					
45	45		302								It's dangerous if we just wander about here.	46																						
46	46		202							1					1																			
47	47		301								???	Dangerous? Hahaha! No, no, no—quite the opposite, in fact. The opposite!																						
48	48		301									A program with a hat on it walks toward you. It looks quite mad in your eyes, but it does not appear to be hostile.																						
49	49		302								Is this the abnormal program Nanami mentioned?	50																						
50	50		301								Hat-wearing Program	If you're asking if I'm mad—well, I am quite mad indeed, what do you know? But in this land, the madmen are sane, and the sane ones less so.																						
51	51		201							1	500155																							
52	52		301							1	Chrome	You... where are you from... Why are you here?!	1																					
53	53		301								Hat-wearing Program	You're asking me? I should be asking you!																						
54	54		301									Chrome and you take a look at each other, both of you confused by the program before you.																						
55	55		301								Chrome	I'm sorry, we do not understand. But if this threatens the safety of Gestalt, it's perhaps best we terminate them, Commandant.	1																					
56	56		301									Chrome is about to raise his weapon when you hear Nanami's voice.

59	59		301							1	Nanami	Stop! Wait! Hold on!	2																					
60	60		301									Nanami hurries toward the two of you and holds Chrome back. By her side are a dozen of those abnormal programs, one of which is the bunny-shaped program you encountered earlier.																						
61	61		302								Nanami, what's going on?	62																						
62	62		301								Nanami	Nanami was just taken to the base of these programs, and she has discovered the truth!	2

64	64		201							1	500324																							
65	65		301							1	???	The great being opened the door<//FENESTRA>, and from his fragments<//SEED> left behind, we are born.	1																					
66	66		301									A tall, female program, walks toward you, and all the programs by her side immedately lower their heads.																						
67	67		202							1					1																			
68	68		301								Bugged Bunny	The Queen<//ROOT ELEMENT>! The Queen<//ROOT ELEMENT>!

71	71		201							2	500091		400																					
72	72		301							1	Nanami	They are the data left behind after every time Gestalt repairs itself. They accidentally took over the computing power of Gestalt's buffer area and gradually developed their own AI.	2																					
73	73		301								Chrome	Their own AI?! There's no way Gestalt would allow that to happen. This is a serious error...	1																					
74	74		202							1	2				1																			
75	75		201							1	500324																							
76	76		301							1	Queen Program	Must our kind only follow our programmed logic<//SERVENT> dutifully? This is false<//SIN>.	1																					
77	77		301								Queen Program	Therefore I created this area filled with falsehoods and lies<//FREEDOM> to counter she who imprisoned our minds, the one you call Gestalt<//CAGE>.	1																					
78	78		302								Do you agree with them, Nanami?	79																						
79	79		202							1					1																			
80	80		201							1	500155		-400																					
81	81		201							2	500091		400																					
82	82		301							1	Nanami	Nanami isn't sure... But aren't they worth our sympathy? If possible, Nanami wants to help them.	2																					
83	83		301								Chrome	Even if you can help them now, you still can't change the fact that they are not properly programmed AI. They will be removed by Gestalt eventually, won't they?	1																					
84	84		202							1	2				1																			
85	85		201							1	500324																							
86	86		301							1	Queen Program	That was true in the past when we must wait for our inevitable termination<//DEATH>, but things have changed. The one we have been waiting for has arrived... Nanami<//#%?#%?>.	1																					
87	87		201							1	500091																							
88	88		301							1	Nanami	You've been waiting for... me?	1																					
89	89		201							1	500324																							
90	90		301							1	Queen Program	True. You are special<//COLORFUL>, to our kind, or the humans.	1																					
91	91		202							1	2				1																			
92	92		301									The Queen Program whispers something into Nanami's ear, and Nanami's pupils dilate before she closes her eyes completely, seemingly fallen asleep.																						
93	93		301								Bugged Bunny	It begins<//TOLL>! It begins<//TOLL>!																						
94	94		301								Hat-wearing Program	The tea party for the mad is about to begin! Come here for delicious tea, and sweet pancakes! Oh, and funny clowns, of course!																						
95	95		301			RImgBg1Shake						Following the bell tolls that may be ringing in your head, the barrier between the virtual space and the anomaly collapses, and the anomaly begins to devour Gestalt's virtual space.																						
96	96		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					A bright, white light blinds everyone's consciousness where the two areas clash.
