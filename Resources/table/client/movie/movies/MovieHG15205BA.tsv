6	6		301							1	Celica	Gray Raven Commandant? You're a bit worse for wear. Is your stomach okay?	1																					
7	7		302								I gotta bad feeling about today...	8																						
8	8		301								Celica	Haha, you're just overthinking. The Gray Ravens are just performing routine equipment tests. What could possibly go wrong?	1																					
9	9		302								Fingers crossed...	10																						
10	10		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Celica	Go back to your room and rest up. Just don't forget to meet at the mission dispatch area later.	1

13	13		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Returning to your room to rest, you find a Construct waiting inside, gracefully sipping a cup of tea.																						
14	14		201							1	500150																							
15	15		301							1	Qu	Pine needle tea... Not as good as black tea, but it sure tastes like the wilderness.	1																					
16	16		302								Qu?! What are you doing here...	17																						
17	17		301								Qu	What's all the fuss about? All I did was use your "collar" as a springboard into Babylonia.	1																					
18	18		302								But your body...	19																						
19	19		301								Qu	I'm just borrowing it for the time being. As I said before, only you can see the real me. Others just see me as some obsolete Construct.	1																					
20	20		302								So... What are your plans for today?	21																						
21	21		301								Qu	Aren't you a paranoid one... I don't have anything planned. I just want to learn more about Babylonia—learn more about your everyday life.	1																					
22	22		301								Qu	You basically know all about my past, but I don't know anything about you. That's not exactly fair as your partner.	1																					
23	23		302								You have a point.	24																						
24	24		301								Qu	Well, what about you?	1																					
25	25		302								I'm going to Mission Dispatch.	26																						
26	26		301								Qu	I will go with you. It doesn't look like the Gray Ravens are around, so I don't think you have any reason to refuse.	1																					
27	27		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				Better than you running around and making a mess, I guess...	1500

31	29		302								(Show her)	30	(Decline)	31																				
32	30	33	301								Qu	Patrolling a Low Viral Intensity Region... Isn't sending a star commandant such as yourself a bit overboard?	1																					
33	31		301								Qu	What's there to hide? No matter how dangerous the task is, I won't be surprised... Let me see.	1																					
34	32		301								Qu	Low Viral Intensity Region guard duty...? That's it?	1

38	36		301							1	Male Commandant	Hmph... Got that right. Our Big Boss is stealing missions from us average joes. Must have a hell of a grudge against us or something.	1																					
39	37		301								Female Commandant	Don't put it like that. Our Big Boss, being all high and mighty, shouldn't have to risk life and limb completing missions. They should just stay back and guard the rear.	2

47	45		301								Female Commandant	No wonder you didn't choose a harder mission, Boss. Taking her with us would just be our death sentence!	2

52	50		202							1					1																			
53	51		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Seething with anger, Qu shuts her mouth and follows you, ignoring the arrogant laughter from the other commandants.																						
54	53		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory31.jpg																								
55	54		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Soon, Qu and the commandants arrive at the location designated for the mission. To your surprise, you are joined by the previous two commandants.																						
56	55		201							1	500138																							
57	56		301							1	Male Commandant	You actually came, Boss. I didn't think you'd seriously accept the mission after everything we said...	1																					
58	57		302								You'd think that, wouldn't you?	58																						
59	58		201							1	500163																							
60	59		301							1	Female Commandant	No matter, just don't slow us down.	1																					
61	60		201							1	500150

64	63		301							1	Male Commandant	I am the leader of this operation. Everyone must obey my orders. Got it, Boss?	1																					
65	64		302								Of course.	65																						
66	65		201							1	500163																							
67	66		301							1	Female Commandant	Boss, you take the west. We'll stay here.	1																					
68	67		201							1	500150																							
69	68		301							1	Qu	Hmph, seems "reasonable"...	1																					
70	69		302								Roger. Let's go.	70																						
71	70		301								Qu	Why do we have to listen to orders from dimwits? Is that how Babylonia works?	1																					
72	71		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				Orders must be obeyed on the battlefield.	72

75	74		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Still unable to understand, Qu follows you to take up garrison in the western region.																						
76	75		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					And very quickly, Qu's concerns come true...

81	80		302								Qu, are you hurt?!	81																						
82	81		301									Qu tears out the Corrupted appendage stabbed into her leg. Vital fluid begins to pour out from her wound.																						
83	82		301								Qu	Don't worry. It's nothing serious... But we can't leave the cave now.	1																					
84	84		401							2	1508																							
85	1000		301									Horrifying screams echo throughout the cave... You can tell that the Corrupted already have you surrounded.																						
86	86		301								Qu	This can't just be a coincidence... The Corrupted already have us surrounded before we could establish a communication channel.	1																					
87	87		301									Obviously, Qu meant that the other two commandants set you up.																						
88	88		302								No way.	89																						
89	89		301								Qu	Boy, aren't you naive... Those in the limelight always attract those that want a share.	1																					
90	90		301								Qu	You can't trust anyone on your way to the top... The Path to Glory is that of solitude.	1																					
91	91		302								I don't want to be at the top.	92																						
92	92		301								Qu	Unfortunately, sometimes you don't have any other choice. Just like now.	1																					
93	93		302								Even if we have our differences, they're still our comrades.	94																						
94	94		301								Qu	Enough with the comrade spiel... Even family members will stab you in the back!	1																					
95	95		302								I choose to trust them.	96																						
96	96		301									You hand a signal flare to Qu.																						
97	97		302								But do you trust me?	98																						
98	98		301								Qu	This is stupid... Even if there's only a 1% chance of success, I still won't lose hope...	1																					
99	1001		204							1	1																							
100	99		301									Qu smiles. She picks up the flare and fires it into the sky—exposing your position to your comrades, but also the enemy.	1

102	101		401							2	1508																							
103	102		301								Corrupted	Rargh—!!! Argh!!																						
104	103		301									As expected, you hear a flurry of footsteps as Corrupted approach the cave.																						
105	104		301									You sling Qu's hand over your shoulder to support her injured leg, then help her to her feet.																						
106	105		302								They're coming, Qu!	106																						
107	106		201							1	500150																							
108	107		301							1	Qu	I take back what I said earlier. Maybe you aren't a star commandant, you're just a fool. Simple as that.	1																					
109	108		302								You're only just now finding that out?	109																						
110	109		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	But I'm the star of Kowloong in my own right. I won't let my partner die so easily.	1

113	112		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Corrupted swarm the cave. Both of you manage to help each other fight through the waves of enemies, but you are nearing your limit.																						
114	113		201							1	500150																							
115	114		301							1	Qu	There's no stopping them...!	1																					
116	115		301									Qu kicks away an approaching Corrupted, causing her remaining leg to ignite with sparks as it is destroyed.																						
117	116		301								Qu	Commandant! It's okay, leave me! Run!	1																					
118	117		302								No need to retreat! Time to counterattack!	118																						
119	118		202							1					1																			
120	119		301									Three flickering lights fly through the air, then fall around you and explode, turning most of the Corrupted into scrap iron.																						
121	120		201							1	500150																							
122	121		301							1	Qu	Have they... really come to save us?	1

124	123		301							1	Male Commandant	Hey, Boss! Are you guys okay?!	1																					
125	124		302								I'm alright. Can't say the same about her legs.	125																						
126	125		202							1					1																			
127	126		301									To your surprise, the two commandants from before arrive with the Support Force from Babylonia.

131	130		301								Male Commandant	Great work, Boss... That sure took a lot of courage to fire that off at a time like this.	1																					
132	131		301									The female commandant and support Construct begin work on repairing Qu's injured legs.																						
133	132		301								Female Commandant	You too. I didn't think an obsolete Construct could last so long against so many Corrupted...	2																					
134	133		301								Male Commandant	I think we underestimated the combat capabilities of older models. I think we should take this to the Science Council for reevaluation.	1																					
135	134		302								No... We just got lucky is all!	135																						
136	135		202							1	2				1																			
137	136		301									Qu couldn't help but laugh seeing you try to desperately explain yourself.																						
138	137		201							1	500150																							
139	138		301							1	Qu	Maybe I underestimated "humans"—whether that be 【kuroname】 or the two other commandants.	1																					
140	139		301								Qu	Ugliness and beauty; malice and goodwill; cowardice and courage; vulnerability and strength—all are intertwined. Humanity is defined by contradiction and irrationality.	1																					
141	140		301									Qu looks off into the distance at the people celebrating the victory. Her gaze finally falls upon the person in the center of it all.																						
142	141		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	【kuroname】, I believe I now have a better understanding of what you believe in.	1
