3	3		301			DialogEnable						Roland and Lamia walk past a sign with "Welcome home!" and a few unrecognizable letters. The town is surrounded by forest, with borders that resemble the texture of black velvet.																						
4	4		301									The morning dew soaks the air, wetting Roland and Lamia's artificial skin through leaves. The sensors send a chilling signal to Roland's M.I.N.D.																						
5	5		301									The moment he comes close to the town, he feels a familiar pulse.																						
6	6		301									The power given to him by agents is still inside his body. He immediately understands something.																						
7	7		301									Luna has been here indeed.

10	10		301							1	Lamia	...Where is this...?	2																					
11	11		301								Roland	An interesting place.	1																					
12	12		301								Lamia	Eek?	2																					
13	13		301								Roland	We may be able to find all the answers here, but it can also be just a trap.	1																					
14	14		202							1	2				1																			
15	15		301									Roland walks forward without telling Lamia all the truth.																						
16	16		301									There are no signs of other Ascendants... Which is understandable. Without solid evidence, this place is just a residue of the past.																						
17	17		301									Roland snaps his fingers, spinning his gun with the other hand.																						
18	18		301									He abruptly stops it, then loads up the bullets.

20	20		201							2	500165		450																					
21	21		301							1	Lamia	...What's wrong?	2																					
22	22		301								Roland	It's too quiet. This place can't be so peaceful.	1																					
23	23		301								Roland	During the Golden Age, machines with artificial intelligence were widely used. In places like this where human communities used to live, no matter how much they resisted the convenience of machines, there has got to be some machines around here for public use.	1																					
24	24		301								Roland	But it's too quiet right now. It's unlikely that the scavengers got rid of the Corrupted here.	1																					
25	25		301								Roland	A place too quiet must be abnormal. An abnormal place is where we can expect enemies.	1																					
26	26		202							1	2				1																			
27	27		301									Just like Roland said, black figures begin to appear from the ruins around the town one after another.																						
28	28		301									Crawling, walking, they stumble toward two of them.																						
29	29		201							1	500334	2	-450																					
30	30		201							2	500165		450																					
31	31		301							1	Roland	Seems we still have some extra work to do before we can search the town uninterrupted.	1																					
32	32		301								Roland	How pathetic. You look like abandoned toys. They left you behind in collapsed buildings, then use you whenever they need to.	1																					
33	33		301								Roland	Where are your "parents"? Do you remember the looks on their face when they threw you away?	1																					
34	34		301								Roland	Have you ever seen those people who control you from behind the scene? Do you recall their faces?	1																					
35	35		202							1	2				1

37	37		301							1	Corrupted	...	1																					
38	38		301									The Corrupted only reply with silence, but they never stop moving.

40	40		201							2	500165		450																					
41	41		301							1	Roland	Hmph, I thought so.	1																					
42	42		301								Roland	You are but empty shells. I shouldn't have tried to talk to you in the first place.	1																					
43	43		301								Roland	But if whoever thinks you scrubs can stop us...	1																					
44	44		301								Roland	Go to the town, Lamia. I'll engage them.	1																					
45	45		301								Lamia	?	2																					
46	46		301								Roland	This place needs some cleaning. I will remove these clowns.	1																					
47	47		301								Lamia	Um... Understood.	2																					
48	48		202							1	2				1																			
49	49		301									Roland holds the shotgun under his chain blade, getting ready to shoot.																						
50	50		301									Lamia leaps on the walls of nearby buildings and climbs up with inhuman dexterity. A few Corrupted want to go after her, but Roland fires the moment they jump onto the wall.																						
51	51		201							1	500334																							
52	52		301							1	Roland	Hey, I'm still here.	1																					
53	53		301								Roland	How rude of you to ignore your guest. Bad kids will be punished by their parents... Sorry, I forgot that yours are long gone.	1																					
54	54		301								Roland	Too bad then, I'll have to do the work for them. Even though you have no souls, you need to learn manners.	1																					
55	55		301								Roland?	Manners? You call this manners?																						
56	56		301								Roland	How is this not?	1																					
57	57		301								Roland	These soulless things still walk the earth. My courtesy is to return them to the dust.	1																					
58	58		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					He raises both weapons, then charges toward the very first Corruptedâ€”																						
59	59		202							1					1																			
60	60		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Like every easily battle in the past, Roland tears the Corrupted apart in no time.																						
61	61		301									Over time, he also becomes more familiar with his new body. The path into the town is now open.																						
62	62		301									But Roland isn't going forward. He just stands still.																						
63	63		301								Roland?	What is it?																						
64	64		201							1	500334																							
65	65		301							1	Roland	...Never mind. Let's go.	1																					
66	66		301								Roland	Lamia? You there?	1																					
67	67		301								Lamia	...Yeah.																						
68	68		301								Roland	I'll enter the town from the lower path to see if they left us something.	1																					
69	69		301								Roland	Can you take care of the upper route?	1																					
70	70		301								Lamia	Um... Okay.																						
71	71		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Roland walks deeper into the town as if Lamia did not just hesitate momentarily.
