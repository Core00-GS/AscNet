3	3		301			DialogEnable						Aside from the noise of machinery, several soft coughs intermittently punctuate the silence within the laboratory.

7	7		301									As the president of WGAA, Allen rarely visits the laboratory of the Science Council. The strong odor of various reagents and electronic components are more pungent than expected. He finds it hard to imagine how people can tolerate staying in such a place for long periods of time.																						
8	8		301									But it is apparent that Asimov, who is deep in thought and staring at the micro-display, is not affected at all.																						
9	9		201							1	500111																							
10	10		301							1	Allen	Ahem...	1																					
11	11		301									Allen deliberately coughs loudly to get Asimov's attention to no avail, showing an expression of helplessness.																						
12	12		301									Fortunately, before Allen has to consider how to be polite and avoid making it awkward, Asimov finally puts down his tools and equipment and looks at Allen with unsurprised eyes.																						
13	13		201							1	500004																							
14	14		301							1	Asimov	Sorry, Allen... for making you wait.	1

17	17		301							1	Allen	It wasn't that long. But maybe look at the clock a bit more often next time, perhaps? It's your request, after all.	2																					
18	18		301								Asimov	Well I certainly was not expecting the leader of the WGAA himself to be the one arriving at my doorstep...	1																					
19	19		301									Allen laughs, then gracefully sits down on what appears to be the cleanest chair in the lab.																						
20	20		301								Allen	After all, it was a direct request from the Science Council, which is out of the ordinary. To tell the truth, I am quite curiousâ€”why did the Science Council, which has always only paid attention to practicality, entrust us to design these so-called "Combat Unit Boosters".	2																					
21	21		301									Asimov rubs his head as if trying to think of an explanation.																						
22	22		204							2																								
23	23		301								Allen	Well, start by telling me what exactly is a "Combat Unit Booster". To be honest, the request your researchers set was a bit vague.	2																					
24	24		301									Seeing Allen place the request on the table, Asimov nods. He waves his arm, and projects a holographic battle plan, which shows a sitrep of the current ground forces.																						
25	25		301								Asimov	Well... I'm sure you know that the counterattack from the ground forces has achieved good results with the help of the task force. We've established conservation areas in various zones with mild virus concentration and we've pushed the front line.	1																					
26	26		301								Allen	Indeed. As a board member, I have a general idea on task force operations.	2																					
27	27		301								Asimov	Good, that makes this easier... Now that we have advanced the front line, we are required to venture into areas with higher concentration of the Punishing Virus.	1																					
28	28		301									Asimov points to the darker areas on the battle map. The varying shades of color appear to indicate the degree of concentration on the ground.																						
29	29		301								Allen	Since we don't have any means to decontaminate the areas with the Punishing Virus, our only option is to go in blind.	2																					
30	30		301								Asimov	Correct. In areas with higher concentration of the virus, our greatest burden isn't actually the Constructs. Rather, it is the commandants who must establish Mind Beacons to stabilize the M.I.N.D. of squad members.	1																					
31	31		301								Allen	Yes, I've read the relevant reports. The areas aren't as inaccessible as "Dead Zones", but we've identified areas with abnormally high concentration.	2																					
32	32		301								Asimov	In fact, many commandants can't even accompany Constructs into these areas of high concentration. This poses great difficulty and risk to continue the operation.	1																					
33	33		301								Allen	So, your solution to this problem... are these "Combat Unit Boosters"?	2																					
34	34		301									Asimov nods, then switches the hologram to display the schematics for the Combat Unit Boosters.																						
35	35		301								Asimov	Our development objective is to provide M.I.N.D. stability for Constructs, thereby reducing the burden of Inver-Devices undertaken by commandants.	1																					
36	36		301								Asimov	Constructs need to retain human cognition in order to stabilize their M.I.N.D. However, "human cognition" has proven to be quite the fickle mistress for science.	1																					
37	37		301								Asimov	Therefore, some researchers suggest that the overall design should emphasize the feeling of comradery akin to "pets" that accompanied humans of the past. So, they hope that the design takes on a more organic appearance.	1																					
38	38		301									Asimov displays a design drafted up by several researchers. At which point, Allen finally understands why such a request could not be put concisely.																						
39	39		301								Asimov	Also, since it's approaching the Lunar New Year, the Science Council will have its hands tied with odds and ends.	1																					
40	40		301								Allen	I see... So that's why you requested the WGAA to design the unit.	2																					
41	41		301								Allen	I still find it surprising that the Science Council would be willing to admit the existence of something beyond the reach of science.	2																					
42	42		301									Asimov turns off the hologram, leans back in his chair and looks at the small screen of flashing data situated before him in contemplation.																						
43	43		301								Asimov	Whether that be Constructs or M.I.N.D. technology, there are still a large number of gaps in our knowledge. Nowadays, many of our achievements are merely the accumulation of countless trials and errors.	1																					
44	44		301								Asimov	What we can do is... transform these experiences and sacrifices into the power Babylonia needs.	1																					
45	45		301									Allen nods, grabbing the request.																						
46	46		301								Allen	Understood. Leave the design of "Combat Unit Boosters" to the WGAA.	2																					
47	47		301								Allen	Since it's approaching the Lunar New Year, I suggest naming the prototypes after the Chinese zodiac. If the "Combat Unit Boosters" has a fixed concept, that should enhance human cognition.	2																					
48	48		301								Asimov	Well, If you already have an idea in mind, the better. What is your estimated delivery date? Considering that you also need to set time aside for testing, how about...	1																					
49	49		301								Allen	Three days. We can deliver the first batch of prototypes to the Science Council within three days.	2																					
50	50		301								Asimov	Three days? But you also have to manufacture the frames... You've got to be joking.	1																					
51	51		301									Asimov looks at Allen in disbelief, seeing no sign of jest.																						
52	52		301								Allen	Did you forget? Not only does the WGAA have a team of prominent artists, but also a group of leading technical experts on hand.	2																					
53	53		301									Asimov taps his pen on the desk as if lost in contemplation.																						
54	54		301								Asimov	Oh, you mean Leonie? Well... If that's the case, then I have nothing to worry about.	1																					
55	55		301									With Asimov's approval, Allen stands up to leave.																						
56	56		301								Asimov	I'll leave it up to you... Oh... One more thing...	1																					
57	57		301									Asimov pauses in hesitation, but continues on.																						
58	58		301								Asimov	...Happy New Year.	1																					
59	59		301									Allen smiles and nods, then puts away the request.
