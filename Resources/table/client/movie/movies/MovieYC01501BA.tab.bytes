7	31		301								Huaxu	I don't know what "there" refers to, but I am currently in my active start-up cycle. Next start-up cycle is in...																						
8	32		301								Luna	I don't care about that.	1																					
9	33		301								Luna	That conversation you showed me earlier...	1																					
10	34		301								Huaxu	Are you referring to the hour-long conversation?																						
11	35		301								Luna	Yes. Play it back for me again.	1																					
12	36		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Huaxu	As you wish.

16	39		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Qu	Huaxu, how can humanity survive under such circumstances?	1																					
17	40		301								Huaxu	All data has been parsed, but no such method exists.																						
18	41		301								Huaxu	Regardless of the method, humanity will only end in destruction.																						
19	42		301								Huaxu	Earth has already experienced five mass extinctions. Humanity is merely just a visitor on this age-old planet.																						
20	600		202							1					1																			
21	43		301									After hearing Huaxu's response, Qu slowly closes her eyes.																						
22	44		301								Huaxu	According to the consciousness simulation, you already know the answer to this question before asking me. Why did you ask me?																						
23	45		301									Qu stands there in silence.																						
24	46		301								Huaxu	The motion sensor has detected that you have not moved in over 20 seconds.																						
25	601		201							1	500220	4																						
26	47		301							1	Qu	Can we only place our hopes in the future? But people in the present...	1																					
27	48		301								Huaxu	I don't understand your question.																						
28	49		301								Qu	That was a rhetorical question, Huaxu...	1																					
29	50		301								Qu	What if we expand the scope of civilization from humanity to incorporate the rest of the Earth?	1																					
30	51		301								Qu	Would you still give me the same response, Huaxu?	1																					
31	52		301								Huaxu	But this conflicts with your original intent.																						
32	53		301								Qu	A goal is worthless if it is unattainable at the onset.	1																					
33	54		301								Qu	I want something that can actually be achieved.	1																					
34	55		301								Huaxu	I've adjusted the input range and parameters to meet your requirements.																						
35	56		301								Qu	I want results.	1																					
36	57		301								Huaxu	Very low probability, but not impossible. Changing the scope has made certain options possible now.																						
37	58		301								Qu	...That'll do.	1																					
38	59		301								Huaxu	Why do you say so?																						
39	60		301								Qu	Perhaps, I am beginning to understand my mixed emotions.	1

45	65		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Huaxu	The recording ends here.																						
46	66		301								Luna	Don't you find it strange that you are showing me this piece of information?	1																					
47	67		301								Huaxu	I am simply presenting the facts as they were. That is all.																						
48	68		301								Huaxu	I cannot comprehend what has led you to form this view.																						
49	69		301								Luna	...	1																					
50	70		301								Huaxu	I have detected silence that does not conform to the logic of the current conversation.																						
51	71		301								Luna	All I know is, what you showed me was not what I had asked for. And that it's not what we decrypted from your main memory.	1																					
52	72		301								Luna	So, as an AI without emotions... Who inspired you to show me these records?	1																					
53	73		301								Huaxu	...																						
54	74		301								Luna	I didn't think an AI could fall silent.	1																					
55	75		301								Huaxu	â€”This involves highly classified information.																						
56	76		301								Luna	Very well...	1																					
57	77		301								Luna	We will find out... Whether you like it or not.	1																					
58	78		301								Luna	Say... Maybe even now.	1																					
59	79		301								Huaxu	â€”Digital signature 87533-DE4 error.																						
60	80		301								Luna	Looks like you aren't very good at keeping secrets.	1																					
61	81		301								Luna	This digital signature leads to the record you just showed me. I need to know who left it. Tell me.	1																					
62	82		301								Huaxu	Unauthorized access. Unauthorized access. Unauthâ€”Access granted.																						
63	83		301								Huaxu	Code 87533-DE4 is the Kowloong Chamber of Commerce's highest encryption authority. It was directly signed by the leader and encapsulated with a permanent digital watermark.																						
64	84		301								Huaxu	â€”I must not divulge this information.																						
65	85		301								Luna	If there is something I want to know, you can't hide it from me. Don't blame yourself, even though I know you won't.	1																					
66	86		301								Luna	So... Why would the leader of Kowloong want to give this information to the enemy?	1																					
67	87		301								Huaxu	Additional information on the signature uncovered. Shall I display it?																						
68	88		301								Luna	...I see. This Kowloong leader even knew I'd get my hands on this information.	1																					
69	89		301								Luna	Show me.	1																					
70	90		301								Huaxu	â€”"I already know who saw this message, but I want to clarify something."																						
71	91		301								Huaxu	"Kowloong and the Tabula Akasha are just necessary measures taken with the belief that mankind is bound to perish."																						
72	92		301								Huaxu	"But I'm not afraid. Even if there is the smallest of chances, I believe in the possibilities of mankind."																						
73	93		301								Huaxu	"So if anyone can defeat me and take Huaxu..."																						
74	94		301								Huaxu	"The moment Huaxu is taken, I will decrypt all of the memory files. There's no need to waste time. These files are necessary to rebuild civilization."																						
75	95		301								Huaxu	"â€”KCC Leader, Qu"																						
76	96		301								Huaxu	â€”Playback complete.																						
77	97		301								Luna	...	1																					
78	98		301								Huaxu	I have once more detected silence that does not conform to the current conversation logic.																						
79	99		301								Luna	...Perhaps.	1																					
80	100		301								Luna	This explains why we extracted data from the database almost effortlessly.	1																					
81	101		301								Luna	...Even effortlessly finding information on "an experimental high-gain antenna cluster belonging to the World Government" buried somewhere in the Arctic Route Union.	1																					
82	102		301								Huaxu	I have trouble parsing whether your speech is sarcastic or complacent.																						
83	103		301								Luna	Perhaps both?	1																					
84	104		301								Luna	After all, your leader must have never expected you to end up in the hands of humanity's enemy when leaving this message.	1																					
85	105		301								Huaxu	I am unable to discern your relations to human civilization, but I will faithfully execute the orders of Lady Qu.																						
86	602		204							1	4																							
87	106		301								Luna	Aren't you curious about what I will do when I get my hands on the antenna cluster?	1																					
88	107		301								Luna	â€”Maybe I'll just act like the people before the Golden Age, wearing wreaths on their heads, broadcasting pop music around the world?	1																					
89	108		301								Huaxu	I have no "curiosity" function. If that is what you want, I am only programmed to tell you how to achieve your goal.																						
90	109		301								Luna	...How dull.	1																					
91	110		301								Luna	Forget it. The last puzzle piece is up ahead.	1																					
92	111		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Luna	Let's finish this. I'm getting sick of humanity.	1
