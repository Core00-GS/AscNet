5	1002		301			DialogEnable				1		In appreciation, or perhaps out of mere amusement, Luna stretches out a hand and gently pats Lamia's face.																						
6	1003		301								Lamia	M-M-Miss Luna...	2

10	31		301			DialogEnable					Luna	It's your turn. No more cards in your hand?																						
11	32		301								Shome	Ngh... Now that you have me, all my cards are useless anyway.																						
12	33		301								Gabriel	You should have seen this day coming.																						
13	34		301								Shome	Indeed, I have. But this is all worth it... to reach the truth that you hid.																						
14	35		301									Hearing Shome, Luna frowns slightly. Gabriel walks expressionlessly to Shome and lifts his head with one hand, then slams him heavily into the ground. The ground cracks from the great impact.																						
15	36		401							2	10007502																							
16	37		301			RImgBg1Shake					Shome	—!																						
17	38		301									Shome's frame is clearly not built to withstand such a blow. The erratic sparks speak volumes of his coming end.																						
18	39		301								Luna	You lack not only self-awareness, but also fear and awe of the unknown.																						
19	40		301									Luna raises her arm. Sanguine flashes skirt from her fingers to Shome's frame. He falls, convulsing violently on the ground. Though Shome's frame is crippled by Gabriel, he is forcibly held awake by Luna.																						
20	41		301								Shome	Huff... huff... puff...																						
21	42		301								Shome	I still remember...																						
22	43		301								Shome	When I was young... my grandfather planted a cherry tree in the family courtyard for me...																						
23	44		301								Shome	Everyone in my family... praised its beauty...																						
24	45		301								Gabriel	What are you getting at?																						
25	46		301									Shome hangs his head, gasping and struggling to squeeze words out of his mouth. Ignoring Gabriel's question, he continues.																						
26	47		301								Shome	But I've never found it beautiful... All that time, I only had one thing in my mind... I want to destroy it...																						
27	48		301								Shome	I wanted to see the blossoms fall, pour over the courtyard... or even me, myself, scattering into pieces...																						
28	49		301								Shome	Whatever the outcome, that, would be MY choice...																						
29	50		301								Shome	Huff... What I did... is just the price to discover the truth.																						
30	51		301								Luna	...Oh? And what have you discovered?																						
31	52		301								Shome	...The essence of... the Ascension-Network.																						
32	503		502							RImgBg1BlowUp																								
33	53		301								Shome	It's essentially a communication protocol... Power is granted through a port, but the access requirements are strict... Those who connect to it and live through the constant filtering... become Ascendants...																						
34	54		301								Shome	Ascendants can wield the power the Ascnet brings... But they are also endlessly tormented by it... Fail to endure the filtering, and they become reduced to a mindless Corrupted...																						
35	55		301								Luna	We all know of this already. Is this the extent of your research?																						
36	56		301								Shome	Then... do you know that not all Ascendants are filtered out by the Ascnet... or by you...?																						
37	57		301								Gabriel	?!																						
38	58		301								Luna	..."Lullaby".																						
39	59		301								Shome	Indeed... That experiment birthed the first artificial Ascendant... One that lived through the initial filtering and... accessed the Ascension-Network...																						
40	60		301								Shome	Though the continuous filtering of the Ascnet afterwards... dulled his strength, causing a gap between him... and the other, more, "natural" Ascendants...																						
41	61		301								Shome	But he, is still... a true... Ascendant.																						
42	62		301								Shome	...The Ascendant—Shome.																						
43	63		301								Gabriel	But that experiment, if I recall...																						
44	64		301									Gabriel whispers in Luna's ear. Luna nods, and Gabriel knows not to pry further. He removes his hat and holds it across his chest, then straightens to observe the Shome before him.																						
45	65		301								Shome	I've worked long and hard... And now... I'm finally about to reproduce the experiment.																						
46	66		301								Shome	Using this new configuration, combined with this park, more Ascendants can be created... And, they can all survive that accursed initial filtering with my help...																						
47	67		301								Shome	You understand what an Ascendant horde entails, don't you, Luna?																						
48	68		301									Shome's face slowly twists into a smile as he speaks. Immersed in his speech, he does not realize the darkening of Luna's expression.																						
49	69		301								Shome	The transformation of quantity into quality... Simple dialectical materialism... the mass-produced Ascendants will become the most powerful force on the earth. They will wipe out all that stands in their way!																						
50	70		301								Shome	Which is why... we should work together, yes? We can work together! How about it?																						
51	71		301								Luna	Enough.																						
52	72		301									Shome stretches out his hands in invitation, but Luna cuts him off midway.																						
53	73		301								Luna	How foolish you are. The truth you've been after... never existed in the first place.																						
54	74		301								Shome	Im... possible... I KNOW... I've received the gift of the network... unlike those Transcendants who have the power, but do not wield it.																						
55	75		301								Luna	Pathetic.																						
56	76		301									Luna walks up to Shome and presses her hand against his forehead. Shome's expression changes from fear to excitement, then to confusion, fading into disbelief in the end. As if dumbfounded, he gawks at Luna.																						
57	77		301								Luna	Do you see now? What that person did to you?																						
58	78		301								Shome	That time... So that's what happened...? I see... then it all makes sense now...																						
59	79		301								Luna	Everything has been a foolish dream of yours. Your experiments were castles in the sky. You've been pouring yourself into an abyss.																						
60	80		301								Luna	Have you ever considered that you lived through the initial filtering, all because of this morbid obsession of yours?																						
61	81		301									Luna removes her hand from Shome's head and gives him a disdainful look.																						
62	82		301								Luna	Artificial ascension. Ha. Nothing but the self-indulgence of a prancing clown.																						
63	83		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					With that, Luna leaves the dying Shome in front of the giant shark statue. She turns and shifts her gaze at the people of Babylonia in the distance.
