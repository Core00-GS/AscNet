3	3		301			DialogEnable						The group brings the new scavengers up to speed with the state of affairs. The new scavengers appear unconvinced, but still agree to investigate the waves with them when they can be heard.																						
4	4		301									When they return, they start talking about the projections they have seen in the Red Tide in great detail.																						
5	5		301									Then the beans are spilled, reaching every last scavenger in the building. All the scavengers start talking about the Red Tide.																						
6	6		301									As the stories reach people, so did the Punishing Virus.																						
7	7		301									No one remembers who first carried the Punishing Virus here. All they have seen are scavengers falling ill one after another, having no serum left to treat themselves.																						
8	8		301									Desperate and seeing no hope in sight, the infected buy in the stories about the Red Tide.																						
9	9		301									When gigantic waves lash the streets and bring away hopeless scavengers, new projections can be seen appearing in the Red Tide.																						
10	10		301									Every time the Red Tide comes, it leaves in its wake still more stories and the Punishing Virus itself, filling scavengers with despair and hope.																						
11	11		301									People are now spellbound by a power they cannot see, worshipping the Red Tide as a religion of some sort.																						
12	12		301									The scavengers believe the Red Tide to be mankind's last salvation and place to which to return.																						
13	13		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Even so, the girl has never stopped praying to God.

32	32		301								Scavenger G	You see, heaven looks different in different ages. If you fail to recognize it now just because it looks different, it just means that you aren't religious enough.	2																					
33	33		301								Scavenger F	Let's go and find it.	1																					
34	34		301								Scavenger G	Of course. Thank you for the information.	2

43	43		301								Scavenger H	No one's ever seen heaven or hell, so it makes perfect sense that we want to believe in what we see, no?	1

48	48		301								Scavenger H	As long as I'm saved, I don't care if heaven is white or red, or if it's a frying pan or some god's temple.	1

52	53		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Afterward, it is now anyone's guess just how many scavengers have fallen prey to the Red Tide.																						
53	54		301									Some of them might have managed to walk away from it and the ruins, but hunger has deprived the girl of the luxury of worrying about anyone else.																						
54	55		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					With death looming close, Youle leaves the abandoned hotel with a wooden stick in hand.

58	59		301									Clouds have turned the skies into a gloomy canvas, the rain soaking the ground as if a water bucket has been toppled over. There is not a single scavenger in sight, and the waves of the Red Tide are the only things making any sound.																						
59	60		301								Youle	I'll praise... Your name... Please... Please... Ha...	1																					
60	61		301									Her prayer slowly degrades into laughter before turning into a wail.																						
61	62		301								Youle	God, where are you?!	1																					
62	63		301									The moon buries itself deep behind the rain and clouds. The girl shouts at the gloomy sky with what little strength she has left, only to be met with God's deafening silence.

71	72		301									She crouches powerlessly on the ground, reaching out for the Red Tide with a desperate smile on her face.																						
72	73		301								Youle	...I've always prayed to you for everyone's happiness...
