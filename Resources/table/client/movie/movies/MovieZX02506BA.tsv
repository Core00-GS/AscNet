7	7		301									The time passes so fast that Pulao could not even remember the outline of the ship before arriving at the destination.																						
8	8		301									After getting off the boat, she walks north and sees exactly what Simpie had described.																						
9	9		301									She sees a mountain, but it has no vitality of mountains. She sees a sea, but it has no surging waves.																						
10	10		301									Only the clink-clank of the sword and bottle on Pulao's back can be heard. The mountain peaks and the sea remain silent.																						
11	11		301								Pulao	It's so quiet.	1

15	15		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Pulao shakes her head, trying to cast the nightmare away. She raises her hand to block the sun and gazes toward the horizon.																						
16	16		201							1	500445																							
17	17		301							1	Pulao	No, it can't be. I must give it a try at least.	1

24	24		301									Neon-like colors loom around the water pillar. Pulao wipes the water drops on her face and finally sees the root of the pillar through the misty clouds. There is an azure whale.

40	40		201							1	500443																							
41	41		301							1	Big Fish	For thousands of years, almost everyone who came to this eastmost land was after my tears.	1																					
42	42		301								Big Fish	I don't mind giving them out, but I'm way past the age when I felt like crying all the time. In fact, I have not wept for almost a hundred years.	1																					
43	43		201							1	500445																							
44	44		301							1	Pulao	What? Then what did Mr. Simpie bring back?	1																					
45	45		201							1	500443																							
46	46		301							1	Big Fish	Oh, that muscular guy. The tear he took was preserved when I was still young.	1																					
47	47		301								Big Fish	A few years ago, I gave out the last drop of tear stored, which marked my "farewell" with my tearful self.	1																					
48	48		201							1	500445																							
49	49		301							1	Pulao	Farewell?	1																					
50	50		201							1	500443																							
51	51		301							1	Big Fish	Yeah. Only kids get to cry whenever they want and do whatever they want.	1																					
52	52		301								Big Fish	Tears are a sign of frailty. Adults don't need them.	1																					
53	53		301								Big Fish	I bade farewell to my vigorous, passionate childhood and youth.	1																					
54	54		301								Big Fish	Before I realized, I could no longer shed any tear.	1																					
55	55		301								Big Fish	It's not that I don't want to help you. I am no longer able to cry.	1																					
56	56		201							1	500445																							
57	57		301							1	Pulao	Why has it become like this...	1																					
58	58		201							1	500443																							
59	59		301							1	Big Fish	If you ask this question, you won't be able to understand it right now.	1																					
60	60		301								Big Fish	Because there is still passion in you. You probably have been like this all along.	1																					
61	61		301								Big Fish	You do what you want to do, and say what you want to say.	1																					
62	62		301								Big Fish	You have a lot of emotions. Of course you can cry whenever you feel like to.	1																					
63	63		301								Big Fish	But my heart has withered. Even if you beat me up, I won't be able to cry.	1																					
64	64		301								Big Fish	I can only accept everything in silence.	1																					
65	65		301								Big Fish	Once passion is gone, only pale voidness remains.	1																					
66	66		201							1	500445																							
67	67		301							1	Pulao	I don't understand the "pale" or "wither" you are saying.	1																					
68	68		204							1	14																							
69	69		301							1	Pulao	I just feel that... It's not that you don't want to cry. You are just unable to cry.	1																					
70	70		201							1	500443																							
71	71		301							1	Big Fish	...Feel? That's too vague.	1																					
72	72		201							1	500445	14																						
73	73		301							1	Pulao	Um... My feelings aren't always right, but I still want to trust my instinct!	1																					
74	74		301								Pulao	Because I saw a strong "spirit" in your eyes, Mr. Big Fish.	1																					
75	75		301								Pulao	Just like all the adults I met before. No matter how difficult their lives were, they could not cry, because they had families, friends and loved ones that relied on them...	1																					
76	76		201							1	500443																							
77	77		301							1	Big Fish	It is impossible for people to really understand and empathize with one another. Those were just your personal feelings.	1																					
78	78		201							1	500445	14																						
79	79		301							1	Pulao	My mother once told me that eyes were the windows to the soul. People use their eyes to express emotions.	1																					
80	80		301								Pulao	Words may lie, but eyes cannot.	1																					
81	81		301								Pulao	When I looked them in the eye, I could understand... Everybody was living their own life. Every life was parallel to others, and they would never cross.	1																					
82	82		204							1	16																							
83	83		301							1	Pulao	They lost tears, and their fragile selves... to not get hurt, or for some other reasons... Sob...	1																					
84	84		201							1	500443																							
85	85		301							1	Big Fish	You came for my tears. Why are you crying yourself?	1																					
86	86		201							1	500445	16																						
87	87		301							1	Pulao	Because... I don't know why. I think I'm not making any sense.	1																					
88	88		301								Pulao	But I just feel so sad. My tears won't stop.	1																					
89	89		201							1	500443																							
90	90		301							1	Big Fish	Sigh... You mentioned parallel lines. I think it's a very good metaphor. Everyone lives on a parallel line, yet every now and then, we reach out and our lines cross.	1																					
91	91		301								Big Fish	But you never know how much information the other party can receive from this one-sided communication.	1																					
92	92		301								Big Fish	They may appear to be very passionate or empathic, but you never know how much they have really understood.	1																					
93	93		301								Big Fish	Investing too much emotion only gets yourself hurt.	1																					
94	94		301								Big Fish	So why not just shut your heart and freeze all emotions?	1																					
95	95		301								Big Fish	I too have questioned this way of living. I was lost. But in the end, I chose to do things this way just like everyone else.	1																					
96	96		301								Big Fish	Dreams, money, love... People have too many things to consider in life. There is no time and energy left to hesitate or cry.	1																					
97	97		301								Big Fish	What I did was rational and correct... You get something, you lose something.	1																					
98	98		201							1	500445	16																						
99	99		301							1	Pulao	Right... Everyone just keeps stacking the problems together... Putting shackles on themselves...	1																					
100	100		301								Pulao	Everyone has their own shackles. Even when they are already badly hurt, they have to act like nothing happened and pretend to be strong in front of others.	1																					
101	101		301								Pulao	But... wouldn't that make them even sadder?	1																					
102	102		301									Pulao is in tears. Big Fish does not know what to do.																						
103	103		201							1	500443																							
104	104		301							1	Big Fish	Um... Maybe I'll give it a try... So I can give you some tears?	1																					
105	105		201							1	500445	16																						
106	106		301							1	Pulao	Sorry...	1																					
107	107		301								Pulao	I won't force you to give me tears anymore, Mr. Big Fish.	1																					
108	108		301									Pulao wipes off her tears. She finally calms down after a few deep breaths.																						
109	109		204							1	6																							
110	110		301							1	Pulao	The pains and stresses from growing up are already placing a heavy load on you, as well as every other adult.	1																					
111	111		301								Pulao	I can't force you to do things just for my own purpose.	1																					
112	112		301								Pulao	The world is vast. There must be another way to save Master, apart from your tears.	1																					
113	113		301								Pulao	I just don't believe there isn't another way to get rid of Punini!	1																					
114	114		301									Big Fish has seen numerous kids over thousands of years. Pulao is no different from them; he has no idea if she is going to cry or laugh the next moment.																						
115	115		301								Pulao	It must have been tough, Mr. Big Fish.	1																					
116	116		301								Pulao	Thank you for everything.	1																					
117	117		301									She was in tears moments ago, but is smiling now.

123	123		301								Big Fish	Your eyes are all swollen. Still, you are smiling at me.	1																					
124	124		301								Big Fish	You said "it must have been tough"...	1																					
125	125		301								Big Fish	Many people said the same to me.	1																					
126	126		301								Big Fish	I don't know whether they meant it, were just flattering me, or being sarcastic…	1																					
127	127		301								Big Fish	But what's so special about your words?	1																					
128	128		301								Big Fish	Such simple words... But they just feel so different...	1																					
129	129		301									Perhaps it is their simplicity that makes them sound so heavy.																						
130	130		201							1	500445	1

137	137		301								Big Fish	I have a childhood panda friend, but we seldom talk after growing up. Every time we contacted each other, there was a purpose. It was either for his elixir, or helping him to buy bargained goods.																						
138	138		301								Big Fish	He sent me bamboos every now and then, but I couldn't even eat them! He said it was to thank me for giving him my tear... But I'm pretty sure the bamboos have "unsold stock" stickers on them.																						
139	139		301								Big Fish	I live the same life every day. But when someone asked about me, I only wanted to escape and stay by myself.																						
140	140		301								Big Fish	There may be many fish around me, but I always keep my distance when they try to enter my heart.																						
141	141		301								Big Fish	This life... is like a silent hell.																						
142	142		301									Big Fish closes his eyes as he tries to recall every little detail of life.																						
143	143		301								Big Fish	There is no god in hell...																						
144	144		301								Big Fish	The god descends from heaven and saves people from hell... That's only a fairy tale.

152	152		301									She is smiling at him. Without a word, she gently pats his head.																						
153	153		301									Maybe a listener who is always willing to stay around can motivate people more than illusionary redemption.																						
154	154		301									The warmth of Pulao's palm circles Big Fish's body and strikes his heart.																						
155	155		301									Her innocent eyes and warm touch make Big Fish recall his dusted memories. The last time he was being treated like this was when his mother tended to him after he got hurt as a child.																						
156	156		301								Pulao	You've already done great.																						
157	157		301									Big Fish feels like he has returned to thousands of years ago. He loses the hardened armor crafted over years and becomes a child again.																						
158	158		301									There is no need to think or worry, for the person in front is giving him all the attention and care. She only wants to cast away his sorrow, and is not seeking anything in return.																						
159	159		301								Pulao	It must have been tough all these years.																						
160	160		301									A ray of sunlight pierces through the darkness in the heart, leaving tiny sparkles in it. Although they're not enough to warm up the cold heart, they still bring back the long-lost warmth.																						
161	161		301								Big Fish	Thank you...
