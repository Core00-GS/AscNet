3	3		301			DialogEnable						Climbing the ladder, the ground underfoot begins to rumble slightly.																						
4	4		301									The source of the rumbling not only comes from Camu fighting against the enemy down below...																						
5	5		301									...But also from the Hetero Tide rushing toward Chrome from above.																						
6	6		301									Facing the surging wave of Hetero-Creatures, Chrome is forced to defend his position in front of the ladder.																						
7	7		301									Even if the corruption of his frame reaches critical mass, he will still continue to fight.																						
8	8		301									However, this is no foolhardy self-sacrifice. Rather, sensing that the level of corruption is no longer rising, he detects something about this strange anomaly.

68	63		301								Vonnegut	As I've said before, the speed of humanity's technological progress can't ensure victory.	1

78	72		301									Right as Vonnegut finishes speaking, the Hetero-Creatures within the waterway quickly recede like the tide.																						
79	73		301								Vonnegut	One more thing.	1																					
80	74		301								Vonnegut	The transport craft you flew in on has been constantly sending "eyes" in search of you.	1

82	76		301								Vonnegut	So I've had Cinderelik take care of the transport craft for you.	1																					
83	77		301								Vonnegut	She said that there were some other issues, but that doesn't concern us, so Cinderelik didn't get involved.	1

144	141		301								???	I've done what I can to stop his Punishing concentration from rising past the point of no return. He should be able to make it safely back to Babylonia.	1

167	164		301								???	Even if you kill them, the same thing will happen in the future. You could get rid of Alpha, but then Luna will just become the next ticking time bomb, and we don't know where she is.	1																					
168	165		301								???	I've been collecting "food" to feed the Red Tide. If they're willing to send us delivery, all the better.	1

258	255		301									He does not know what might happen if he passes out here. Wanshi has not specified.																						
259	256		301									But by the look on his face, it definitely would not be good.																						
260	257		301									I must stay awake and leave a clue... Chrome struggles to gain control over his broken finger.																						
261	258		301									...A29.																						
262	259		301									He writes this simple message on the palm of his hand with the vital fluid exuding from his fingertip.																						
263	260		301									Column A, number 29. This is the address for Asimov in his terminal's directory.																						
264	261		301									Most of the time, Asimov is in his workshop where he cannot be reached. Only this address is able to reach him regarding top-secret research.																						
265	262		301									In addition, only those involved in these top-secret projects know this address.																						
266	263		301									If they are willing to use heavy-handed means to interfere with his plans, such as signal jammers, he has no other choice but to write this glimmer of hope on his hand.																						
267	264		301									If his assumption is correct, Wanshi and Kamui will understand this clue as they check each invalid comm link.																						
268	265		301									After all, they are sure to connect the dots while looking at the directory itself.																						
269	266		301									In order to make the number more apparent, Chrome once again struggles to gain control over his fingertip.																						
270	267		301									Pain. Deep, agonizing pain.																						
271	268		301									Prior to this mission, Chrome has not used pain to stay conscious for quite some time.

278	276		301									All to keep Langston Smith on top.																						
279	277		301									But now... There was no need for such a cold, relentless pursuit of "perfection."																						
280	278		301									Becoming a "Smith" was no longer his sole pursuit...																						
281	279		301									Perhaps, it is the sense of familiarity that gives him a little peace of mind or, perhaps, that he has already reached the limit.

348	345		301									After the Longinus Arsenal destroyed most of the Red Tide, there were still mass casualties in the ruins of City 075.																						
349	346		301									They cleaned up a large number of Hetero-Creatures, transported supplies, recovered samples, and collected data. It may have appeared insignificant compared to the achievements of the core personnel, but it was still equally important.

405	402		301									The doctor laughs awkwardly.																						
406	403		301								Wanshi	It doesn't have to be in a maintenance room. He just needs a matching action module and vital fluid dialysis.	2																					
407	404		301								Doctor A	Are you going to operate?	1																					
408	405		301									She hurries to the temporary maintenance table and checks the stock for Chrome's model.																						
409	406		301								Doctor A	All that's left is a hand module, but you can't replace it without a maintenance room.	1																					
410	407		301								Doctor A	After all, it's not as simple as just replacing the hand.	1																					
411	408		301								Wanshi	Did you check the reserves? The Star of Life used to also keep emergency supplies on hand. Those—	2																					
412	409		301								Doctor A	This is all we have.	1

421	418		301								Doctor A	He won't get help, if you know what I mean.	1																					
422	419		301								Doctor A	If you ask why, all I can say is that the hospital is running out of supplies.	1																					
423	420		301								Doctor A	I'll be in trouble if I say any more.	1																					
424	421		301									She clears her throat after hooking up the machine.

436	433		301								Wanshi	...I thought about that too, but what the hell does it mean?	1																					
437	434		301								Kamui	In puzzle games, this sort of code normally represents a password, location, or a particular spot in a large set of data.	2																					
438	435		301								Wanshi	The captain couldn't have left us a clue about something none of us know about, like a lock. The closest building related to A29 is a shop.	1

452	449		301								Kamui	Want to contact the captain's father? He rarely talks about his family, but I've heard others mention him.	2																					
453	450		204							1	7

478	475		301								Rosa	A-an emergency...? Go to Zone B3 of the Science Council. That's where he goes so no one bothers him.																						
479	476		301									B3 is the new research building of the Science Council, which is fairly close to the Star of Life.																						
480	477		301								Kamui	Let's go.

485	482		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The shuttle quickly turns into Zone B3. There is a young girl standing in front of the stairs of the building.																						
486	483		301								Rosa	Hi... I'm Rosa. You said it was an emergency, so I followed you here to see if I can help... Mr. Asimov should be in the sealed lab.

490	487		301							1	Rosa	Yeah, Mr. Asimov doesn't like being bothered, so...	1																					
491	488		301									She explains obediently but begins to get nervous after seeing Kamui's anxious face.																						
492	489		301								Rosa	S-s-sorry! Follow me!!	1																					
493	490		301				RImgBg1Shake					Rosa races into the building and up the emergency stairwell at nearly Mach 1, banging on a wall around the corner.																						
494	491		301								Rosa	Mr. Asimovvvv...!	1																					
495	492		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Rosa's voice trembles with a slight whimper. The crashing of various research equipment comes from the depths of the sealed lab.

498	495		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		Arriving upstairs, Asimov stares at Wanshi with kindred dark circles of brilliance under his eyes as he is packing up the things he had just knocked over.																						
499	496		301									Wanshi wants to ask, "So, someone CAN scare Asimov, huh?" but he has more pressing issues.																						
500	497		201							1	1081001

503	500		301							1	Asimov	...	1																					
504	501		301									He looks at Chrome, who is gravely injured in Kamui's arms, and his face turns pale.																						
505	502		301								Asimov	Come with me.	1																					
506	503		301									Asimov hurries into the sealed lab. Rosa stands there timidly and waves as if choosing not to follow them.																						
507	504		301								Asimov	This might not be the ER, but your timing couldn't be better.	1																					
508	505		301								Asimov	I've been working to fix the remaining problems with Chrome's frame since this morning. Sorry, I left my terminal in the workshop. People kept disrupting me.	1																					
509	506		301								Asimov	I just so happened to fix the issue that's been giving me trouble all this time.	1																					
510	507		301									Asimov pushes open the door, takes Chrome from Kamui and places him on the maintenance table.																						
511	508		301								Asimov	Wanshi, give me hand.	1
