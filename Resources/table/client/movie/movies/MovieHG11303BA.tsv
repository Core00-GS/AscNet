18	18		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Liv	Huh? Haelios solution? What for, Commandant?	1																					
19	19		302								Just curious.	20																						
20	20		204							1	14																							
21	21		301								Liv	Let's see. It's essentially a sensory amplifying drug for Constructs. Through stimulating the sympathetic ganglia of the M.I.N.D., a Construct's sensory inputs can be amplified in a short amount of time.	1																					
22	22		302								What's the catch?	23																						
23	23		301								Liv	It amplifies mostly negative sensory information... Like pain, or emotional fluctuations—magnifying them several-fold.	1																					
24	24		301								Liv	In a way, it does force a Construct conscious through pain... Anyhow, Haelios is deemed illegal by Babylonia.	1																					
25	25		204							1	7																							
26	26		301								Liv	But what are you asking this for, Commandant...?	1

30	30		301								Liv	Haelios solutions are only usable by Constructs, but you shouldn't mess with them still, Commandant!	1																					
31	31		302								I know.	32	Don't worry.	32																				
32	32		301								Liv	...Are you sure?	1

34	34		301								Liv	But that reminds me, though. Thank you, Commandant—for claiming the supplies in my stead.	1																					
35	35		302								Have you been busy?	36	It's nothing.	36																				
36	36		204							1	14																							
37	37		301								Liv	Yeah... I don't know if you've heard, Commandant... But two squads have taken heavy casualties... Aside from the confirmed deaths, there are still many MIA...	1																					
38	38		302								I've heard.	39																						
39	39		301								Liv	Command seems to value the info from this operation greatly. But... the memory shells of the KIA members have all been destroyed—to an irrecoverable degree.	1																					
40	40		301								Liv	I know I'm now under Gray Raven and frontline medical support isn't my duty, but I still...	1
