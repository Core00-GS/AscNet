14	14		301								Lee	Same here. However, some projections appeared when I was looking for clues regarding the farewell letter.	3																					
15	15		301								Lee	Looks like two people read the full note. When they did, they cheered and went to the location to look for it.	3																					
16	16		301								Lucia	When was this recorded?	2																					
17	17		301								Lee	The timestamp was too blurry to identify. Seems like it was a long time ago.	3																					
18	18		301								Lucia	Even after all this time, there still hasn't been any news on how to control the Punishing Virus...	2																					
19	19		301								Lucia	In other words, they may have run into danger, or it may have been completely useless information.	2																					
20	20		302								Any new clues, Lucia?	21																						
21	21		301								Lucia	I saw a large number of scavengers devoured by the Red Tide.	2																					
22	22		301								Liv	A large number of... scavengers?	1																					
23	23		301								Lucia	They seemed almost enthralled by it as if they were doing it willingly.	2																					
24	24		301								Lucia	I only saw this brief moment. I don't have any other information.	2																					
25	25		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	We'll keep an eye out. Let's keep going, Commandant.	1
