11	11	12	301							1	Lee	I agree with Commandant. Liv would not enter such a dangerous place alone.	1

13	13	17	301							1	Karenina	No, the best option now is to go inside the castle.	2																					
14	14	15	301								Kamui	I agree. I have never met any Demon Generals.

19	19		301							1	Karenina	We—I mean, 【kuroname】—you have a piece of the Goddess' artifact, don't you?	1																					
20	20		301									Karenina knew Camu gave me a fragment after defeating the Demon General. I didn't know why he did that, but that meant neither team could have the complete artifact.																						
21	21		301								Karenina	Anyway, I have been to two Demon General's Castles. Honestly, the traps and the Demon Generals themselves were pretty weak.	1																					
22	22		301								Karenina	If they ever find this place, the artifact will be taken within an instant. So we must take initiative and get the artifact first.	1																					
23	23		201							1	500166																							
24	24		301							1	Lucia	We take control of the key item. Is that what you mean, Karenina?	1																					
25	25		201							1	500180																							
26	26		301							1	Karenina	Hmph, I'm not going to explain it again.	1																					
27	27		301								Karenina	【kuroname】, do you remember what the first Demon General said? He had this "perception" that allowed him to monitor the surroundings of the castle.	1																					
28	28		302								I do.	29	I don't remember.	30																				
29	29	32	301								Karenina	The second Demon General also said something similar. I think they should have the ability to know who passed by, at what time.	1																					
30	30	31	301								Karenina	Really? What are you, a gold fish?	1																					
31	31	32	301								Karenina	Whatever. I think the Demon Generals must have a surveillance system to monitor everything happening around their castles.	1

35	35		301							1	Kamui	So we can get the artifact and ask the Demon General if Liv had ever visited this place. Awesome quest chain design!	2																					
36	36		301								Lee	I see... If we have never been inside a Demon General's Castle, we wouldn't arrive at this conclusion.	1																					
37	37		301								Lee	The design of this game is truly amazing.	1																					
38	38		301									Kamui was all hyped up while Lee was impressed by the game design. Lucia shook her head at the two males as they seemingly immersed themselves in the game.
