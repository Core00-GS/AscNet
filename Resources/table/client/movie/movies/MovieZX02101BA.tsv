10	12		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Having walked along the long, narrow corridor, Nikola stands before the old, wooden door at the end, and he pushes it open to enter the room.

12	14		401							2	743																							
13	15		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Unveiled before his eyes is a crass, tasteless, yet ridiculously luxurious study. Nikola takes a look around the room and frowns.																						
14	16		301									Velvet curtains? A chandelier? The long Black Walnut table? These are all trinkets from ages ago. To have moved these unnecessary items onto Babylonia during an apocalypse is the cruelest mockery to those who were left behind.																						
15	17		301									And the cause of Nikola's furrowed brows—the silver-haired man leaning back on the leather swivel chair—has finally noticed his presence, and his body shifts.																						
16	18		301									With his hands on the chair arms, Collins slowly turns around.																						
17	19		201							1	500319		400																					
18	20		201							2	500012		-400																					
19	21		301							1	Collins	Long time no see, my dear Nicky.	1																					
20	22		301									Collins' tone is fervent with a sense of joy, as if the two of them are actually old friends who have not seen each other for a while.																						
21	23		301									Nikola's brows furrow further upon Collins' "intimate" greetings.																						
22	24		301									Time has passed, and Nikola's station and stance are far removed from where they once were. Still, the disgust and contempt he feels about the man before him have not changed from his days in Kurono.																						
23	25		301								Collins	C'mon, stop staring at me like a mortal enemy. It's been so long! Take a seat and we'll catch up.	1																					
24	26		202							1	2				1																			
25	27		301									Collins gestures to Nikola with a "please" motion, his tone frivolous and comical as if he is still speaking to his subordinate from Kurono instead of the Chief Commander of Babylonia.																						
26	28		301									Not hiding his displeasure, Nikola sits down on the other side of the long table regardless.																						
27	29		201							1	500319		400																					
28	30		201							2	500012		-400																					
29	31		301							1	Nikola	I'm not here to catch up, Collins. What Kurono has been doing to 【kuroname】 has crossed the Parliament's line.	2																					
30	32		301								Collins	P for Parliament, or P for President, huh?	1																					
31	33		301									Collins savors every word he says.																						
32	34		301								Nikola	...	2																					
33	35		301									Nikola's silence makes Collins laugh.																						
34	36		301								Collins	Times are a-changin', and we're now playing in space instead of on earth. Folks like us manage to live this long because we know the rules, and we follow them, and long before this mess started, we made them.	1																					
35	37		301								Nikola	Don't lump me in with you.	2																					
36	38		301								Collins	True. You've thrown away your past for a spot on the front stage as the dazzling Chief Commander, the boss soldier of Earth's forces... but you and I both know that a person's nature is determined by their upbringings.	1																					
37	39		301								Collins	You can't bury who you were. Why else would you appear before me as yourself instead of the angry soldier boy you are now? In this room, nonetheless!	1																					
38	40		301								Collins	Don't tell me you just want to condemn Kurono's actions with a serious speech.	1																					
39	41		301									Before Nikola can react, Collins has already interrupted him.																						
40	42		301								Collins	Sure, I invited you, but you were the one who accepted the invitation! Here you stand inside my personal study instead of a proper conference room—you know damn well the nature of this conversation, and still, here you are.	1																					
41	43		301									Collins' voice sounds like a venomous snake, its tongue out flicking by a human's ear, whispering.																						
42	44		301								Collins	I offer you intel, and you repay me with clearance. Hasn't this been how we work together? Why are you acting like a stranger, dear Nicky?	1																					
43	45		301								Nikola	I've turned a blind eye within my authority as much as I could regarding you detaining a Task Force commandant.	2																					
44	46		301								Nikola	Understand this—I can take away your clearance any moment if I want. Kurono is a shadow that can't go into the light. You wouldn't want your dirty laundry hidden all these years exposed in the sun, would you?	2																					
45	47		301								Collins	Nah, you won't do that. We've surely passed the bluffing stage by now, Nicky! You won't go back on your word before you've gotten what you want.	1																					
46	48		301								Collins	Your president is sentimental, but not you. The Gray Raven Commandant is just leverage to you, no more important than any other commandant you got. You aren't going to war to get one person back, because you don't care.	1																					
47	49		301									Nikola makes a light grumble.																						
48	51		301								Nikola	You bet your leverage on the right table instead of giving it away when you know everyone has their eye on it.	2																					
49	53		301								Nikola	My inaction and passiveness on this matter have caused Hassen's grievance. I have no interest in an open conflict with him.	2																					
50	54		301								Collins	See, I like talking to you because you put logic before your feelings! Unlike your President Hassen and his crocodile tears.	1																					
51	55		202							1	2				1																			
52	56		301									Nikola's expression shifts for a second.																						
53	57		301									Collins does not notice it, however.																						
54	58		201							1	500012																							
55	59		301							1	Nikola	You have no more clearance to hold onto our commandant. Even if I were willing to look the other way, neither the public nor the soldiers on the frontline would tolerate it much longer.	1																					
56	60		301								Nikola	You're locking up the person who defeated the Polyphage. The Gray Raven Commandant has become the symbol of "hope" to the public. They're more likely to believe someone they can see instead of your made-up accusations.	1																					
57	61		301								Nikola	That's why I said you crossed "the Parliament's line"—not every member gives a damn about the Gray Raven Commandant, but they all care about the Parliament's authority and image to the people.	1																					
58	62		301								Nikola	You've contained 【kuroname】 in the name of "confined treatment" for way too long.	1																					
59	63		202							1					1																			
60	64		301									Collins shakes his head.																						
61	65		201							1	500319		400																					
62	66		201							2	500012		-400																					
63	67		301							1	Collins	Not long enough. I still haven't found what I was looking for. "Confined treatment" is nowhere near enough.	1																					
64	68		301								Nikola	I can't understand what your obsession is with a human commandant.	2																					
65	69		301								Collins	Nah-ah-ah—Nicky, you know damn well what it is.	1																					
66	70		301								Nikola	...	2																					
67	71		301									Nikola remains silent as Collins claps his hands, satisfied.																						
68	72		301								Collins	Enough with the bullshit. I want to assign the Gray Raven Commandant on a mission.	1																					
69	73		301								Collins	We've detected Luna's M.I.N.D. activity on the surface. We need the commandant to track her whereabouts.	1																					
70	74		301									Nikola's fists tighten. He does not agree with Collins' request immediately.																						
71	75		301								Nikola	What makes you so sure that it's Luna?	2																					
72	76		301								Collins	The signal from Luna's M.I.N.D. activity is special—even more so than the Ascendant we once "got."	1																					
73	77		301								Collins	It's like... tens of thousands of M.I.N.D.s bundled together in the same place. She usually keeps hers pretty damn well hidden, but we caught a glimpse last time when the Polyphage was having her for dinner.	1																					
74	78		301								Collins	We've detected its signature again, and this time, we need the Gray Raven Commandant to track it and find Luna for us.	1																					
75	79		301								Nikola	You don't have the clearance. 【kuroname】 is part of the military's Task Force. The commandant's assignments must be appointed through the system in the Operation Logistics Center.	2																					
76	80		301								Collins	Which is why you're here, Nicky! A little clearance isn't going to stop our Chief Commander, am I right?	1																					
77	81		202							1	2				1																			
78	82		301									Nikola closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. Then he denies Collins' request staunchly.																						
79	83		201							1	500012																							
80	84		301							1	Nikola	As you said, I'm the Chief Commander. I cannot treat our rules as non-existent.	1																					
81	85		301								Nikola	We spent so much effort rebuilding laws and orders in the world after the apocalypse. They're the framework upon which the world progresses forward.	1																					
82	86		301								Nikola	Break the rule once, and you put a crack in the dam. It won't be long before it crumbles down and all hell breaks loose.	1																					
83	87		201							1	500319	5																						
84	88		301							1	Collins	You're starting to sound like your hypocritic president.	1																					
85	89		301								Collins	But I know the truth. This is just my dear Nicky putting up a show. You don't give a shit about any of this.	1																					
86	90		301								Collins	Neither you nor I am satisfied with maintaining this brief stability of the status quo.	1																					
87	91		301								Collins	To be backed into a corner... This stability is just the calmness inside a coffin. Your ambition lies beyond this, no? Isn't finding a new way forward for humanity and destroying this false serenity what you've wanted?	1																					
88	92		202							1					1																			
89	93		301									Collins takes out a folder from a hidden compartment underneath the table as he speaks.																						
90	94		301									It is an old, brown paper bag, its edges so worn down over time that it looks like it will fall apart upon touch.																						
91	95		301									Collins throws it onto the table before him carelessly, however. The scent of rotting paper fills the room.																						
92	96		201							1	500319																							
93	97		301							1	Collins	Besides, I've found what you've been searching for all this time, dear Nicky.	1																					
94	98		202							1					1																			
95	99		301									Nikola's gaze freezes when it reaches the words on the paper bag, and his pupils shrink slightly.																						
96	100		301									Stamped in red on the bag is the phrase "TOP SECRET".																						
97	101		301									Difficult to catalog and transmit, physical means of delivering information have been abandoned by humans for the last hundred years, ever since entering the Information Age.																						
98	102		301									Except for classified information. Most people choose paper to back up their secrets unanimously.																						
99	103		301									Digitized information is easy to leak, and hard disks and CD-ROMs have a much shorter lifespan than paper. The shortcomings of a piece of paper are strengths when it comes to keeping classified intel.																						
100	104		301									Staring at the date on the corner of the paper bag, Nikola subconsciously reaches for it.																						
101	105		301									But right as he is about to touch it, a finger presses down on a corner of the bag, holding it there.																						
102	106		301									Nikola's eyes shift up from Collins' finger to his face.																						
103	107		301									The slight raise of the corner of Collins' mouth reminds Nikola of how he must have looked right now.																						
104	108		301									Quietly, his hand withdraws from the bag.																						
105	109		201							1	500319		400																					
106	110		201							2	500012		-400																					
107	111		301							1	Nikola	As I said, I cannot break the rules.	2																					
108	112		301								Nikola	The Gray Raven Commandant's assignments must be given through the Operation Logistics Center with an official Construct squad. The mission details must also be officially approved and logged.	2																					
109	113		301								Collins	Then we'll make it "official," just the way you like.	1																					
110	114		301								Nikola	...	2																					
111	115		301								Collins	From what I've heard, you've got a Task Force directly under you called Cerberus. It's a remotely connected team—very experimental stuff—and its captain is a Construct from Kurono...	1																					
112	116		202							1	2				1																			
113	117		301									Before he finishes, Collins gently lifts a corner of the bag with his finger as if showcasing his trophy before Nikola.																						
114	118		201							1	500012																							
115	119		301							1	Nikola	...	1																					
116	120		301									The silence brews.																						
117	121		301									Nikola thinks for a moment before coming to a decision.																						
118	122		301								Nikola	I'll transfer the authority to assign Cerberus to the Operations Logistics Center. The Gray Raven Commandant can be deployed alongside this squad.	1																					
119	123		301								Nikola	You can send one of yours to oversee the operation, but find someone with a cleaner resume. I don't want people complaining, and I don't want... too much noise made.	1																					
120	124		301								Nikola	Just this once.	1																					
121	125		301								Nikola	When it's over, everything goes back to where they belong, including the commandant.	1																					
122	126		202							1					1																			
123	127		301									Satisfied with the answer he receives, Collins pushes the folder in his hand to the other side of the table before Nikola.																						
124	128		301									Nikola picks up the paper bag, standing up and ready to leave.																						
125	129		301									Collins stops him once more.																						
126	130		201							1	500319																							
127	131		301							1	Collins	What's still in that Golden Age trash that gets you all nervous? I had my technicians analyze it, but it's just some experiment data from the Science Council a few years before the Virus destroyed everything.	1																					
128	132		201							1	500012																							
129	133		301							1	Nikola	...	1																					
130	134		201							1	500319																							
131	135		301							1	Collins	Dug up from the ruins by some guy, took a trip through the black market before ending up at Daedalus, only to be recycled by us... Things like this are a dime a dozen.	1																					
132	136		301								Collins	They might have been top secrets and cutting-edge technologies back in the day, but they are as useful as a piece of paper in a time like this when everything has to start over from scratch.	1																					
133	137		301								Collins	I'm just so damn curious. What's inside this that gets our Nicky here all obsessed?	1																					
134	138		301									Before Nikola answers, Collins puts a finger to his mouth in a "hush" gesture.																						
135	139		301								Collins	You don't have to say anything. Soon, we—will—all—find out.	1																					
136	140		301								Collins	As long as we're on this ship together, nothing will remain a secret forever.	1																					
137	141		301									Nikola tilts his head.																						
138	142		201							1	500012	13																						
139	143		301							1	Nikola	If that's the case, then everything about Kurono will not remain hidden forever as well.	1																					
140	144		202							1					1																			
141	145		301									Collins ignores him, and Nikola steps outside the room.																						
142	146		401							2	753																							
143	147		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The door closes behind him.

147	151		201							1	500012																							
148	152		301							1	Nikola	I've brought the thing back.	1																					
149	153		202							1					1																			
150	154		301									Nikola throws the paper bag he got from Collins not too long ago before Hassen.																						
151	155		301									Hassen catches it, and he immediately takes out the data from the bag and reads it carefully.																						
152	156		201							1	500012		-400																					
153	157		201							2	500011		400																					
154	158		301							1	Hassen	Did Collins notice?	2																					
155	159		301								Nikola	No, I don't think he knew. He thought we disagreed, and I was giving him the Gray Raven Commandant behind your back.	1																					
156	160		301								Nikola	I'm surprised too. I thought you'd reject me when I proposed this. You seem to value the commandant a lot, after all.	1																					
157	161		301								Hassen	Valuing 【kuroname】 doesn't mean I'll stay in a stalemate with Kurono forever. Getting stuck in an arm-wrestle helps nobody.	2																					
158	162		301								Hassen	Not to mention, they've been acting desperate. Being high-profile and blatant isn't their MO.	2																					
159	163		301								Hassen	I'm worried that Collins has got his hands on something big—something important enough that gives him leverage to escalate like this.	2																					
160	164		301								Hassen	They said they needed 【kuroname】 to help track down an Ascendant, but given the way and the number of people they're deploying, do you think they're truly hunting an Ascendant?	2																					
161	165		301								Hassen	Collins has his eyes set on 【kuroname】 right now, which means 【kuroname】 must be an important part of their plans... Connect the dots, and what do you think we'll find?	2																					
162	166		301									Nikola's expression turns gradually more solemn as Hassen speaks.																						
163	167		301								Nikola	Something that's connected to 【kuroname】 at this point in time... Are you saying that what they're after is—	1																					
164	168		202							1	2				1																			
165	169		301									Nikola does not need to name "what they're after" as he already knows the answer from Hassen's eyes.																						
166	170		201							1	500011																							
167	171		301							1	Hassen	Indeed. It's exactly what you think.	1																					
168	172		301								Hassen	Of course, it's only my guess.	1																					
169	173		301								Hassen	Regardless, we can't prove that they've got ahold of "her." Not to mention that we have no idea what they need "her" for.	1																					
170	174		301								Hassen	We need to know what this all means, so we must act.	1																					
171	175		301								Hassen	You were our best option. If I "compromised" on the Gray Raven Commandant, Collins might figure out that something is afoot.	1																					
172	176		202							1					1																			
173	177		201							1	500012		-400																					
174	178		201							2	500011		400																					
175	179		301							1	Nikola	But not me... is that so?	1																					
176	180		301								Hassen	Exactly. Your past makes him less cautious, and our usual "disagreements" has provided our plan the best cover.	2																					
177	182		301								Nikola	I always think that you are more cold and logical than me in some ways.	1																					
178	184		301								Nikola	But I have to warn you—Collins is not a fool. Even if he didn't notice at first, the moment I revealed my interest in that data, he knew what a trump card he got in his hand.	1																					
179	185		301								Nikola	He must have had a backup made before giving me the original file.	1																					
180	186		301								Hassen	I'm sure he had, but it doesn't matter.	2																					
181	187		301								Hassen	Collins' data is incomplete. He doesn't know the more crucial information hidden behind this file.	2																					
182	188		301								Nikola	And you're certain this intel will bring us what we want?	1																					
183	189		301								Hassen	I'm certain.	2																					
184	190		301								Hassen	To avoid suspicion, we had Murray retrieve a piece of information from Gestalt when Huaxu hacked it.	2																					
185	191		301								Hassen	That information isn't complete, and neither is the one in Collins' hand.	2																					
186	192		301								Nikola	It appears to be a report on the zero-point reactor.	1																					
187	193		202							1	2				1																			
188	194		201							1	500011																							
189	195		301							1	Hassen	It is.	1																					
190	196		301								Hassen	These files are the regular data feedback sent to the Science Council by each reactor.	1																					
191	197		301								Hassen	But we've discovered that the data reported by one of the reactors is slightly different. Based on Gestalt's calculation, the data was encrypted to hide a certain set of numbers.	1																					
192	198		301								Hassen	After we deciphered it, we discovered a set of coordinates hidden within.	1																					
193	199		301								Hassen	The coordinates of the zero-point reactor codenamed Atlantis. Because our information was incomplete, we only managed to get the latitude and the altitude of the reactor.	1																					
194	200		301									Hassen waves the folder in his hand.																						
195	201		301								Hassen	We deduced that the longitude is hidden in reports during the same period of time, which ended up being the one that fell into Collins' lap.	1																					
196	202		202							1					1

198	204		201							2	500011		400																					
199	205		301							1	Nikola	...I don't understand. Why would someone encrypt the location of their own reactor, only to send that information out?	1																					
200	206		301								Nikola	This is like the work of a...	1																					
201	207		301								Nikola	A spy.	1																					
202	208		301								Hassen	You're right.	2																					
203	209		301								Nikola	The World Government was well established at that point. There were no borders or separate governments—why would someone from the Golden Age try to leak this information?	1																					
204	210		301								Hassen	Just because there was only one government didn't mean that there were no disagreements.	2																					
205	211		301								Hassen	Zero-point reactors represented the next energy revolution. Whoever controlled it could reshuffle the world order and control everything.	2																					
206	212		301								Hassen	Which was why they had to hide the location of their reactor.	2
