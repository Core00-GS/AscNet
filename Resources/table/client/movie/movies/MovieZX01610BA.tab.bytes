6	6		301							1	Hassen	Considering the sudden nature of the occurrence, I'll keep this briefing short.	1																					
7	7		301								Hassen	Huaxu's intrusion was connected to multiple access points. Even Asimov couldn't determine the actual location of Huaxu in such a short time.	1																					
8	8		301								Hassen	But the coordinates you acquired may be an important lead.	1																					
9	9		201							1	500166																							
10	10		301							1	Lucia	You mean...	1																					
11	11		201							1	500011																							
12	12		301							1	Hassen	It's time to take the offensive.	1																					
13	13		302								Understood.	22	Is this data... reliable?	14																				
14	14		301								Hassen	Good question. We've been thinking about whether or not they've set another trap.	1																					
15	15		301								Hassen	After referencing the local data, we've found that the coordinates left by Huaxu are consistent with the possible base of several Ascendants we checked earlier.	1																					
16	16		301								Hassen	Even if these coordinates aren't where Huaxu is located, they may still be... the...	1																					
17	17		201							1	500004																							
18	18		301							1	Asimov	Key bridge access point.	1																					
19	19		201							1	500011																							
20	20		301							1	Hassen	That's right. Key bridge access point.	1																					
21	21		301								Hassen	Regardless, even if it's just an empty husk, it is still heavily associated with the Ascendants.	1																					
22	22		301								Hassen	This does pose some risk, but it's a risk we have to take.	1																					
23	23		301								Hassen	With this opportunity, we've never been closer to the Ascendants than we are now. Even if we can't eliminate them, we can at least clear up the mystery surrounding them.	1																					
24	24		301								Hassen	As for the potential risks, we can minimize it with a swift and efficient operation.	1																					
25	25		301								Hassen	We'll strike them before they even have time to react and complete our mission.	1																					
26	26		201							1	500166																							
27	27		301							1	Lucia	President, in the virtual space... We ran into...	1																					
28	28		201							1	500011																							
29	29		301							1	Hassen	Huaxu, correct? Although that was most likely just one of Huaxu's sub-terminals.	1																					
30	30		301								Hassen	You've all seen what the Ascendants are capable of. You saw them steal Huaxu's key during the battle in Kowloong.	1																					
31	31		301								Hassen	After that, Luna successfully launched an attack on New Murmansk.	1																					
32	32		301								Hassen	Although we've already tried our best to save as many survivors as we could with the Forsaken and the Forest Guard...	1																					
33	33		301								Hassen	The ARU still suffered considerable damage. She decimated a large area around the Research Institute.	1

36	36		301							1	Liv	...How can that be?	1																					
37	37		201							1	500011																							
38	38		301							1	Hassen	The Forest Guard that arrived on the scene provided us with a report of the situation.	1																					
39	39		301								Hassen	According to the damage and the statement from Staessen before he passed out in the ICU, the Ascendants stole the "experimental high-energy antenna cluster" from the ruins, just as we suspected.	1																					
40	40		201							1	500026																							
41	41		301							1	Lee	The experimental high-energy antenna cluster?	1																					
42	42		201							1	500011																							
43	43		301							1	Hassen	We couldn't get any more information out of Staessen. After all... even the doctor doesn't know if he'll ever wake up again.	1

45	45		201							2	500004		400																					
46	46		301							1	Asimov	Judging from what happened to you, the reason why Huaxu can invade Gestalt probably has to do with the antenna cluster taken by the Ascendants.	2																					
47	47		302								Is Huaxu working for the Ascendants?	48																						
48	48		301								Hassen	At the very least, the order to infiltrate Gestalt comes from them.	1																					
49	49		301								Asimov	Oh, by the way‚ÄîGestalt has returned to normal. I slightly modified the computing power and adjusted the parts the Spear of F.O.S. can use.	2																					
50	50		202							2					1																			
51	51		203							1	0.25																							
52	52		301								Hassen	In conclusion, we know what the Ascendants were after this time. It has also provided us with decisive intel.	1																					
53	53		301								Hassen	‚ÄîThat is, the coordinates you obtained.	1																					
54	54		301								Hassen	The coordinates point near City 075.	1																					
55	55		201							1	500026																							
56	56		301							1	Lee	City 075? Isn't that...	1																					
57	57		201							1	500011																							
58	58		301							1	Hassen	It's not exactly next to it, but you're right. It's the ruins of the zero-point reactor.	1																					
59	59		301								Hassen	We'll take care of Gestalt. You, on the other hand, are tasked with investigating the coordinates.	1																					
60	60		301								Hassen	Even if it doesn't lead to the Ascendants, it will at least point us in the right direction.	1																					
61	61		301								Hassen	So this time, we'll be sending all the available forces to support you.	1																					
62	62		203							1	0.25	-400																						
63	63		201							2	500012		400																					
64	64		301							1	Nikola	We've already assembled the Support Force and Task Force. They're awaiting your orders.	2																					
65	65		302								Commander Nikola?	66																						
66	66		301								Nikola	It's about time. We can't just be amassing forces.	2																					
67	67		301								Nikola	We need to strike when it's time to strike.	2																					
68	68		301								Hassen	We can't let this opportunity slip through our fingers. Advocating peace doesn't mean giving up the fight.	1																					
69	69		301								Hassen	It's also time for all of Babylonia to realize what we're up against.	1																					
70	70		301								Nikola	In short, all of Babylonia is ready.	2

80	80		302								?	81																						
81	81		301								Hassen	I should let you know something before the mission starts.	1																					
82	82		302								Understood.	83

84	84		301							1	Lucia	Should we stay here?	1																					
85	85		201							1	500011																							
86	86		301							1	Hassen	...I'm not sending „Äêkuroname„Äë away on another mission. There's just something... I need to tell your commandant.	1																					
87	87		302								Will you give us a moment?	88

91	91		301									The three Gray Ravens give a brief but firm nod, then turn to leave.																						
92	92		301									Hassen does not immediately start talking. Instead, he looks at Lucia as she walks off, lost in thought.																						
93	93		301									It is not until the three Gray Ravens have exited the bridge does Hassen turn to face you.																						
94	94		201							1	500011																							
95	95		301							1	Hassen	Looks like my hunch was correct...	1																					
96	96		302								?	97																						
97	97		301								Hassen	Remember the thing I sent you to do alone?	1																					
98	98		301								Hassen	I gave you some temporary clearance for the sake of training and other considerations.	1																					
99	99		301								Hassen	It gave you access to something you shouldn't have found out.	1																					
100	100		302								...	101																						
101	101		301								Hassen	As you know, there is too much information in Babylonia that could not be brought to light.	1																					
102	102		301								Hassen	But on a battlefield, the lack of crucial information can cause irreparable consequences.	1																					
103	103		301								Hassen	...	1																					
104	104		301									Hassen stops and closes his eyes for a long time. His frown alludes to the struggle inside him.																						
105	105		301									Finally, Hassen's deliberation ends with a sigh.																						
106	106		201							1	500004																							
107	107		301							1	Asimov	Are you sure you still want to do this?	1																					
108	108		301									When Hassen sighs, Asimov slowly walks out of the corner, understanding the implication of his sigh.																						
109	109		201							1	500011																							
110	110		301							1	Hassen	Yes. They were the first to show their hand, so we should also be fully prepared. This incident is likely to be an important point of progress for us in this war.	1																					
111	111		301								Hassen	Asimov, it's time to give it to „Äêkuroname„Äë.	1																					
112	112		302								What do you want to give me?	113																						
113	113		201							1	500004																							
114	114		301							1	Asimov	A "double-edged sword." It will either be your key to victory, or it will be the thing that destroys the Gray Ravens.	1

149	149		301									The indentations on Murray's neck fade away, revealing the camouflaged tentacles.																						
150	150		301									A peculiar-looking Construct appears along with them.																						
151	151		301								Yata	In that case, shall we go and find some other unlucky vermin to kill, Captain?																						
152	152		301								Yata	I have no interest in those I'm not allowed to kill.
