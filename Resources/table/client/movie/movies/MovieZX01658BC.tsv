3	3		301			DialogEnable						You would not know how critical a decision you have made, as the pain from the Punishing Virus corruption forces you to dissociate, keeping you from thinking straight.																						
4	4		301									In your trance, you hear someone speaking to you.																						
5	5		301								???	Can you tell me what is the most crucial foundation of the Commandant-Construct maneuver?																						
6	6		301									This is the question the lecturer of tactics and strategies asked you when you left the lecture hall a long, long time ago.																						
7	7		301									What was it that you answered?																						
8	8		302								The Mind Beacon.	9	The Inver-Device.	9																				
9	9		301								???	No... That's not it.																						
10	10		301								???	It's "trust."																						
11	11		301								???	A commandant is responsible for the life of the Construct, and the Construct's M.I.N.D. is constantly affecting the commandant.																						
12	12		301								???	Because of that, a Construct needs to trust the commandant's directives, and the commandant needs to trust the Construct's capability.																						
13	13		301								???	When you lead your squad to a fight and make the call to attack—when you command... your Constructs trust you wholeheartedly.																						
14	14		301								???	They will fulfill your every order.																						
15	15		301								???	Maybe it's not the most proper way to describe something on a battlefield, but—that sounds nice, doesn't it?																						
16	16		301								???	Only absolute trust can create a real bond between a commandant and a Construct.																						
17	17		301								???	It's the simplest lesson, and yet... most of you forget it eventually.																						
18	18		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				???	【kuroname】, I want you to...

23	23		301							1	Luna	What are you doing?	1																					
24	24		301									Your consciousness returns from your memories, and you find the lethal amount of Punishing Virus around you reducing to an acceptable level.																						
25	25		301								Luna	You're bold enough to connect with an Ascendant on the Ascension-Network, and yet you don't know what the consequences are?	1																					
26	26		302								A corrupted mind, probably.	27	Court martial, I guess.	27																				
27	27		301								Luna	Then why did you do it?	1																					
28	28		302								Because of "trust."	29																						
29	29		204							1																								
30	30		301								Luna	And what is it that you trust?	1																					
31	31		302								How much you miss your sister.	32																						
32	32		202							1					1																			
33	33		301									Regret, agony, hate... The thoughts crashing into your mind may be chaotic, but one sentiment stands out from the rest, like an untainted ray of moonlight gleaming into the darkest depths of the consciousness.																						
34	34		301									...It is the purest, fiercest form of yearning.																						
35	35		201							1	500238	4																						
36	36		301							1	Luna	...	1																					
37	37		302								Lucia trusts you in the same way.	38																						
38	38		302								She trusts that she will find her sister in you.	39																						
39	39		302								She's still fighting, even now, for a way to save you.	40																						
40	40		302								That's why I don't want to let her down.	41																						
41	41		301								Luna	Is that so...	1																					
42	42		204							1	3																							
43	43		301									Luna closes her eyes again, sensing a new pathway on her M.I.N.D. where her power is being steered.

45	45		301								Luna	My power is being directed away...	1																					
46	46		204							1																								
47	47		301									The crimson Punishing Virus converges on Luna unceasingly, repairing the damages on her frame bit by bit. Luna opens her eyes.																						
48	48		204							1	2																							
49	49		301								Luna	...The Ascension-Network considers you to be extremely dangerous. It's massively increasing my power to counter the influence from your Mind Beacon.	1																					
50	50		204							1																								
51	51		301									She reaches out a hand to you, and you can see a subtle crack on it.																						
52	52		301									As your connection deepens, the status of Luna's frame is transmitted to you.																						
53	53		301									She is disintegrating as she is being put back together. Breaking and mending, the two forces collide within Luna, and you can tell from your small thread of connection that she is in no state to keep fighting.																						
54	54		301									The Punishing Virus that comes after your Mind Beacon is being intercepted by Luna before it lands. Her M.I.N.D. deviation is on the verge of reaching the breaking point.																						
55	55		301									And yet, she articulates what she wants to say with the utmost clarity.																						
56	56		301								Luna	Maybe there can be a different path ahead of us, one that I haven't thought of. Maybe there are more possibilities for the future of this world when people like you exist.	1																					
57	57		301								Luna	Maybe it's too late to understand that now, but...	1																					
58	58		204							1	1																							
59	59		301								Luna	—it's enough. Now, let me unleash all the power I have left and show you what I'm capable of!	1																					
60	60		204							1	5																							
61	61		301									Luna takes a look at the ashen Hetero-Creature confronting Lucia.																						
62	62		301								Luna	You poor, pathetic mistake born from this rotten path.	1																					
63	63		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Luna	Let me offer you your eternal rest.	1
