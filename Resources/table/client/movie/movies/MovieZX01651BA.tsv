33	33		301									A monster the size of a titan stands before her, its body radiating unnerving red lights like the Hetero-Creatures.																						
34	34		201							1	500101																							
35	35		301							1	Gabriel	It is the Punishing Virus manifested, the nightmare of humankind—I have brought its ultimate form to fruition. "Polyphage", I call it.	1																					
36	36		301								Gabriel	It can devour everything before it and transform them into its own body. It will take over every land it crosses by releasing the Red Tide.	1																					
37	37		301								Gabriel	And we, the Ascendants, will rule this land.	1																					
38	38		301								Gabriel	Its existence will be our mightiest weapon in claiming Earth...	1

45	45		301							1	Gabriel	That is true. It still requires one crucial component—a part called "Ascendant".	2																					
46	46		301								Luna	If you're trying to waste my time with a joke...	1																					
47	47		301								Gabriel	Miss Luna, you have no idea what the Polyphage is actually capable of...	2																					
48	48		202							1	2				1																			
49	49		301									Gabriel's eyes are veiled in madness as he explains his plan to Luna.																						
50	50		301									Luna listens quietly at first until she hears Alpha's name in Gabriel's plan. Her pupils constrict as she raises her hand, and blades formed of the Punishing Virus shoot toward Gabriel.

52	52		201							2	500101		500																					
53	53		301								Luna	What did you just say?!	1																					
54	54		301									Witnessing Luna's reactions, Gabriel looks even madder. He looks up and stares at Luna, not even bothering to dodge the hovering spikes in front of him.																						
55	55		301								Gabriel	All Ascendants are obligated to sacrifice for the Ascension-Network. I hope Miss Luna is able to let go of her attachment for the grander scheme of things.	2																					
56	56		301								Luna	This empty vessel is no answer to anything. I will not sacrifice anything for this fruitless attempt.	1																					
57	57		301								Luna	As an agent of the Ascension-Network, even I'm not going to offer my sister to achieve our goals.	1																					
58	58		301								Gabriel	This is the only way... Your sister is nothing compared to what we want to accomplish.	2																					
59	59		301								Luna	If you try to hurt her—	1																					
60	60		203			PanelActor2Shake				2	0.5	500	-150																					
61	61		301									Gabriel is forced to kneel under unsurmountable pressure from Luna's wordless gaze.																						
62	62		301								Luna	The point of Ascension-Network is selection.	1																					
63	63		301								Luna	Once we finish filtering this world, it'll become our paradise... With no hindrance from the past, this planet will be eternal.	1																					
64	64		301									Luna signals Gabriel to stand with her eyes, but he remains kneeling on one knee.																						
65	65		301								Gabriel	The bodies of Ascendants are merely tools for our goal. Miss Luna, as our superior, you should not be... preoccupied with these sentiments.	2																					
66	66		301								Luna	Preoccupied... Are you suggesting these creatures born from the Punishing Virus are capable of replacing us?	1																					
67	67		301									Luna speaks slowly, but even her smile carries alarming weight.																						
68	68		301								Luna	Even... replacing an agent like me?	1																					
69	69		203			PanelActor2Shake				2	0.5	500																						
70	70		301									Gabriel does not budge. He struggles but stands tall against the force from Luna, showing an unusual sense of rapture in his eyes.																						
71	71		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Gabriel	Maybe Miss Luna should not come to a conclusion so soon...	2

74	74		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Looking at the Polyphage's head, Luna finds an ashen figure slowly descending. She can sense the unique and potent power signature coming from it without Gabriel explaining.																						
75	75		301								Gabriel	This is the result of the evolution of the creatures born from the Red Tide. As the terminal of the Polyphage, controlling it means controlling the Polyphage—a power no less impressive than an agent's.																						
76	76		301									The ashen Hetero-Creature lands before Luna, mimicking Gabriel's actions and bowing its head.																						
77	77		301									Luna cannot tell if it is acting out of compliance, or... threat, or neither, simply imitating what has been demonstrated.																						
78	78		301								Luna	I see. That explains your confidence. Then, allow me to test the so-called mightiest Hetero-Creature.																						
79	79		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Gabriel	Of course. Once Miss Luna has experienced its might, you will understand that it is more than meets the eye.
