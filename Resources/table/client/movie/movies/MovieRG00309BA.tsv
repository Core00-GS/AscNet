11	12		301								Lee	Sorry, nothing here.	2																					
12	13		301								Kamui	Me neither. There's no one else around apart from us.	3																					
13	14		301								Lucia	Is that so...	1																					
14	15		301									Lucia opened her system menu. It clearly showed a team of four.																						
15	16		301									Lucia, Lee, Liv, and Kamui.																						
16	17		301								Lucia	Liv, where are you...	1																					
17	18		301									Everybody seemed to wake up at different times. Whether this was the system setting or an error was still unknown.																						
18	19		301									Before three of them woke up, they had all heard Liv's slightly panicking voice.																						
19	20		301									But Lucia couldn't do anything, because she didn't have a "body" in the game yet.																						
20	21		301								Lee	How strange... Kamui, did you hear anything from Celica? Like, does this game purposely separate team members from one another?	2																					
21	22		301								Kamui	Never... But Liv's HP still looks good on the menu. I don't think she is in danger yet.	3																					
22	23		301								Lucia	Yeah, indeed.	1																					
23	24		301									Kamui did have a point, Lucia thought. This was a game world after all, maybe Liv was just caught up in a special event.																						
24	25		301								Lee	What do we do now, Lucia? Shall we follow the instructions and go to the castle?	2																					
25	26		301								Lucia	Let's follow the guide. We might be able to find clues about Liv on the way. 	1																					
26	27		301								Kamui	Let's beat the monsters and leave the spawn point first!	3
