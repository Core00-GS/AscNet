9	8		301									This mechanical unit must be what Rosetta meant by protection.																						
10	9		301									Through Captain Staessen's arrangements, you find a Polar Soldier unit delivered to you. Rosetta inserts you within the cockpit without further hesitation.																						
11	1002		302								Is this really necessary?	10	This feels weird...	11																				
12	10	12	301								Rosetta	Because I promised the Gray Ravens that I'd keep you safe.	1																					
13	11	12	301								Rosetta	You'll get used to it. ARU fishermen use these for deep-sea operations.	1																					
14	12		301								Rosetta	I've always been a jinx of sorts... That was likely why the transport craft crashed. So, it's better to be safe than sorry.	1																					
15	1003		302								You keep saying you're unlucky.	13	Maybe you're just being superstitious?	14																				
16	13	15	301								Rosetta	Yeah, because I really am... Sorry.	1																					
17	14	15	301								Rosetta	No, I don't think it's just superstition, but a type of intuition. Anyway, it never hurts to over-prepare.	1																					
18	15		301								Rosetta	...We should have brought more troops with us. We're assigned to a relatively small area, but...	1

23	17		301									A series of distraught voices interrupts your conversation. You and Rosetta look over to see several armed fishermen fighting with bionics.																						
24	18		301								Fisher	This is our land! We'll git 'em back with our bare hands. Git outta 'ere, you hairy dodos!	1

30	21		301									Rosetta brandishes her equipment and rushes to their aid, but halts right as she activates her wings.																						
31	3000		302								What's the matter?	22	Let's go save them, Rosetta.	24																				
32	22	3001	301								Rosetta	Since you're the commandant, it just occurred to me that it might be better to wait for your orders.	1																					
33	3001	23	302								Then let's save some fishermen, Rosetta.	23
