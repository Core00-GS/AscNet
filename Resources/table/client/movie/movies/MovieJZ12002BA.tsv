9	9		301								John	You used to be less aggressive.	1																					
10	10		301								John	Those sharp edges of yours will make you a target. All you did was expose this area for me to attack.	1																					
11	11		301								John	Haven't I taught you to lay low and wait for the right opportunity to strike?	1																					
12	12		301									The White Queen moves to B3 with John's command, her threat plain as day.																						
13	13		301								Chrome	Unless... I am equipped to handle what happens next.	2

20	20		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Chatter	Where's Asimov? Why isn't he here? Didn't we invite him specifically?																						
21	21		301								Chatter	I heard he's working on something about a specialized frame. Probably too busy for this.																						
22	22		301								Chatter	When was the last time you saw him at a place like this anyway?																						
23	23		301								Chatter	Touche.																						
24	24		301								Chatter	But the Science Council is paying a lot of attention to his little project. It could turn out to be something important.																						
25	25		301								Chatter	If it were up to Nikola, he would've invented all kinds of terrifying weapons.																						
26	26		301								Chatter	If we don't keep him in check...																						
27	27		301								Chatter	Sure, better weapons mean a better chance to reclaim Earth. But to "them," something uncontrollable is hardly worth the trouble.																						
28	28		301								Chatter	I heard some councilmen proposed a bill to increase our hold on the Constructs, but President Hassen rejected it for "humanitarian grounds."																						
29	29		301								Chatter	"Humanitarian grounds"... Honestly, do they still count as humans?																						
30	30		301								Chatter	Wasn't the bill proposed because of that "incident"? The way that Construct lost control...																						
31	31		301								Chatter	I heard some civilians were hurt because of that...																						
32	32		301									The chatter from the guest not far from him has caught Chrome's attention. He looks at them, his head tilted.																						
33	33		201							1	500156																							
34	34		301							1	Chrome	(A Construct lost control?)	1																					
35	35		301								Chrome	(I didn't hear anything about that when I was in the base... No Construct has been punished for assaults either.)	1																					
36	36		301								Chrome	(It's a severe problem if a human is attacked by a Construct.)	1																					
37	37		301								Chrome	...Could someone be spreading this "rumor" intentionally?	1																					
38	38		301									At this stage, exploiting a Construct to push for one's agenda is a desperate last resort. Anyone in a position of power would be foolish to do something this self-sabotaging.																						
39	39		301									On the other hand, Chrome understands Constructs well enough to know that deviating M.I.N.D.s in regular military Constructs is nigh impossible in a place like Babylonia without external stimuli.																						
40	40		301								Chrome	Something is afoot...	1																					
41	41		301									Thinking that he needs more information, Chrome proceeds to find John on the other end of the ballroom.																						
42	42		301								Chrome	Mr. Smith, there's something about...	1																					
43	43		201							1	500303																							
44	44		301							1	Servant	Mr. John Smith?	1																					
45	45		301								Servant	Councilman Tram wishes to talk to you about the project regarding restarting the Central Purification Filter in City 089.	1																					
46	46		201							1	500149																							
47	47		301							1	John	I see.	1																					
48	48		301									John turns and looks at Chrome.																						
49	49		301								John	If you want information, you need to look for it yourself.	1																					
50	50		202							1					1																			
51	51		301									John follows the servant away and leaves Chrome after his parting words.																						
52	52		301									As John walks away, something that Chrome has been ignoring becomes blatantly clear.																						
53	53		301									Even when the humans on Babylonia know little to nothing about the process of becoming a Construct, it is impossible that no one knows about his transformation due to who his father is.																						
54	54		301									After all, there is nothing better to gossip about than the rich and powerful "screwing up."																						
55	55		301									Shifting his back to the room, Chrome can feel gazes upon gazes fixated on him, but they all dart away the moment he turns to look.																						
56	56		301									He adjusts his audio module and listens in on the chatter of the crowds.																						
57	57		301								Chatter	(Look, isn't that...)																						
58	58		301								Chatter	(Why is there a Construct here?)																						
59	59		301								Chatter	(Shush! Didn't you hear what Smith just said? It's still his seat, so keep your voice down.)																						
60	60		301								Chatter	(But why dress like a human when he's already a Construct...)																						
61	61		301								Chatter	(Who can tell what the high and mighty thinks?)																						
62	62		301								Chatter	(Anyway, better stay away from him.)																						
63	63		301								Chatter	(Right, lest he loses it like that Construct earlier...)																						
64	64		201							1	500156																							
65	65		301							1	Chrome	Humans on Babylonia rarely come into contact with Constructs... so where do their impressions of Constructs come from?	1																					
66	66		301								Chrome	I ought to investigate.	1																					
67	67		401							2	1516																							
68	68		301									Chrome straightens his collar and heads toward the talking guests.																						
69	69		204							1	1																							
70	70		301									With a polite smile, he salutes the embarrassed-looking crowd.																						
71	71		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Chrome	About what you just said, would you mind telling me more about it?	1

76	76		301									Footsteps approach from the empty, expansive hall outside. With a light ring of acknowledgment from the retinal scanner, the heavy doors to the laboratory slide open.																						
77	77		301									The lights from the corridor outside illuminate the dark room. A young researcher is sitting between an array of glowing monitors, and he squints toward the door.

82	82		301							1	Asimov	Based on the previous test, Lucia has indeed retrieved all her memories. Her M.I.N.D. has been stable so far with no sign of deviation.	2																					
83	83		301								Nikola	And her frame?	1																					
84	84		301								Asimov	She doesn't seem to have any problem using the Plume frame either.	2																					
85	85		301								Asimov	The instability we saw before has greatly improved as well. As of now, the Plume frame is more or less fully realized, functioning the way I designed it to be.	2																					
86	86		301								Nikola	In that case, we can finally move on to the next stage of the specialized frame project.	1																					
87	87		204							2	8																							
88	88		301								Asimov	...	2																					
89	89		301								Nikola	Is there a problem?	1																					
90	90		204							2																								
91	91		301								Asimov	The draft of the next specialized frame is just about complete with the data I've got from Plume.	2																					
92	92		301								Asimov	There are simply not enough samples and data on specialized frames for me to reference. And unlike Plume, this new frame has no compatible data from an original source.	2																					
93	93		301								Asimov	We will be facing many complications even when we are just trying to get someone to adapt to it.	2																					
94	94		301								Asimov	The research has already hit a bottleneck. If we want to move on to the next stage...	2																					
95	95		301								Asimov	I need an exceptional Construct with M.I.N.D. stability way above average.	2																					
96	96		301								Asimov	I need to find someone who matches the criteria and is willing to volunteer.	2																					
97	97		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Nikola	I'll leave it to you, then.	1
