3	3		301			DialogEnable						Murray is walking on the Eden 16-B road, checking his handheld terminal from time to time.																						
4	4		301									Up high, two pairs of eyes—Valeria and Bazhi—are monitoring him from both sides.																						
5	5		301								Valeria	Point A, target confirmed.																						
6	6		301								Yata	Point B, target confirmed.																						
7	7		301								Yata	Don't you find it a bit fishy?																						
8	8		301								Valeria	Why?																						
9	9		301								Yata	If he knows he's being tracked, why would he look so defenseless?																						
10	10		301								Valeria	You have a point. Run a scan.																						
11	11		301								Yata	Roger.																						
12	12		301									...																						
13	13		301								Yata	...I knew he's up to something.																						
14	14		301								Valeria	Details?																						
15	15		301								Yata	It's a lure. The real deal is hiding in a corner and waiting for us.																						
16	16		301								Yata	Not a bad attempt, but unfortunately, I'm not your run-of-the-mill support Construct.																						
17	17		301								Valeria	Well then. Plan B it is. I'll ambush from the blind spot on the left, and you go from the right.																						
18	18		301								Yata	Are we putting him down?																						
19	19		301								Valeria	Let me get a confirmation first.																						
20	20		301									Valeria begins tinkering with her terminal to contact someone outside, but to no avail.																						
21	21		301								Valeria	Can't get a signal.																						
22	22		301								Yata	Is Gestalt doing this?																						
23	23		301								Yata	Or our bad boy over there?																						
24	24		301								Valeria	Both possible.																						
25	25		301								Yata	Then what? Do we still go all the way?																						
26	26		301								Yata	We can't get an ID on the kid right now. If he's an ally, and we're the backup...																						
27	27		301								Valeria	We'll go for a non-lethal approach. But if push comes to shove, then we'll take him down.																						
28	28		301								Valeria	We can chuck it on Commander Nikola. He gave the orders.																						
29	29		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Yata	Never see you so slimy normally. Then let's go.
