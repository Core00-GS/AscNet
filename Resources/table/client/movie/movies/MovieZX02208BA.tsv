4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Liv	Given the physical feedback we got when fighting the Hetero-Sapiens, we once believed they didn't consist of any sensory organs for pain.	1																					
5	5		301								Liv	But we got a completely opposite conclusion after our analysis. Their sensory receptors are incredibly active.	1																					
6	6		401							2	1515																							
7	7		301									Liv points to the Hetero-Sapien diagram before her.																						
8	8		301								Liv	Extremely potent electric signals spread in their nervous system after they're hurt. Unlike humans, however, this signal doesn't end in their brains but in their umbilical cords.	1																					
9	9		302								They're uploading those signals.	10																						
10	10		202							1					1																			
11	11		301								Eleanor	Right. Although they have developed humanoid forms, the Hetero-Sapiens have yet to develop a human-like society.																						
12	12		301								Eleanor	They still maintain an insect-like hive mind.																						
13	13		301								Support Construct	The Hetero-Sapiens form the receiving ends of the nervous system that is set throughout the Forest Park, uploading stimuli from the outside world and letting the central system process all the information.																						
14	14		302								Like a spider web...	15																						
15	15		201							1	500286	3																						
16	16		301							1	Hans	The closer we are to the CPF, the more Hetero-Sapiens there are, like insects protecting their queen.	1																					
17	17		301								Hans	Hives... uploading signals...	1																					
18	18		302								I see.	19																						
19	19		302								That was why Liv said we might be able to help with the situation out there.	20																						
20	20		201							1	1031001																							
21	21		301							1	Liv	Right. Hetero-Sapiens always show up in groups, like cells growing underneath the skin. Their signals won't be uploaded until they have been gathered and organized.	1																					
22	22		301								Liv	Before those signals are uploaded, these Hetero-Sapiens are sharing their senses.	1																					
23	23		301								Liv	If we dislodge the umbilical cords that are used for uploading their sensory stimuli...	1																					
24	24		302								They will have to experience those stimuli themselves.	25																						
25	25		201							1	500293																							
26	26		301							1	Vanessa	Failing to handle the input, their frail bodies will break.	1																					
27	27		301								Vanessa	They will be hindered, if not paralyzed.	1																					
28	28		201							1	500201																							
29	29		301							1	Simon	Right. Their extremely sensitive sensory organs will become their biggest weakness in this case.	1																					
30	30		302								Which means breaking one will cause a chain reaction.	31																						
31	31		201							1	500372																							
32	32		301							1	Harley Jo	Hmm, I get it. Domino effect.	1																					
33	33		301								Harley Jo	Push one and they all fall.	1																					
34	34		201							1	500293																							
35	35		301							1	Vanessa	Tsk. Kind of an effective and elegant tactic.	1																					
36	36		202							1					1																			
37	37		301									Hans nods after hearing the reports from the Support-type Constructs.																						
38	38		201							1	500286																							
39	39		301							1	Hans	This intel will help the other ground forces tremendously if we can pass it back to Babylonia.	1																					
40	40		201							1	500293	7																						
41	41		301							1	Vanessa	The question now is how we send it back.	1																					
42	42		401							2	559																							
43	43		301									BUZZâ€”																						
44	44		301									A buzz echoes within the Pulia Forest Park Ruins, signaling another wave of comms interference.																						
45	45		301								Vanessa	Do we have to wait for the interference to end before reporting in?	1																					
46	46		301								Vanessa	Time is of the essence when we're fighting on the surface. I don't think it's a good idea to waste our time here.	1																					
47	47		201							1	500286																							
48	48		301							1	Hans	Harley Jo, we're farther in the forest now than when Woodcock was first here. Have you finished calibrating your algorithm?	1																					
49	49		201							1	500372																							
50	50		301							1	Harley Jo	Yes, Commander. Just in time.	1																					
51	51		202							1					1																			
52	52		301									Harley Jo takes out a mechanical device from his backpack as you all watch, and he places it on the ground, tinkering with it.																						
53	53		201							1	500026																							
54	54		301							1	Lee	This is...	1																					
55	55		201							1	500372																							
56	56		301							1	Harley Jo	Yep, exactly what you think it is.	1																					
57	57		301									Harley Jo stops his motion and leaves the machine on the ground.																						
58	58		301								Harley Jo	Now, everyone, try to communicate without using your voice or your audio module.	1																					
59	59		401							2	1515																							
60	60		201							1	500293	7																						
61	61		301							1	Vanessa	(...Why bother? The result's the same anyway.)	1																					
62	62		201							1	500372																							
63	63		301							1	Harley Jo	(Hehe, so you got it.)	1																					
64	64		302								(It's a Comms amplifier.)	65																						
65	65		301								Harley Jo	That's right! I modified it myself. We couldn't use it since I wasn't done calibrating it, but after the last few cycles of interference, I have calculated the optimal amplifying level in the Forest Park.	1																					
66	66		202							1					1																			
67	67		301									Vanessa takes a few steps back, distancing herself from Harley Jo.																						
68	68		201							1	500293	7																						
69	69		301							1	Vanessa	Sure, but the effective range isn't ideal.	1																					
70	70		201							1	500374	4																						
71	71		301							1	Yata	We can fix that if we adjust the way it's wired, like this.	1																					
72	72		201							1	500372																							
73	73		301							1	Harley Jo	Whoa, look at how proficient you are.	1																					
74	74		201							1	500374																							
75	75		301							1	Yata	Not my choice. Shorthalt made me learn it.	1																					
76	76		301									Her mechanical arms pick up the device on the ground like tentacles, navigating inside it smoothly and deftly rewiring it.																						
77	77		301								Harley Jo	Ah, I see. This will increase the effective range of a single unit.	2																					
78	78		202							1	2				1																			
79	79		201							1	500026																							
80	80		301							1	Lee	Those are some very impressive skills in modifying a device like this... Hold on, did you just say "a single unit"?	1																					
81	81		202							1					1																			
82	82		201							2	500372																							
83	83		301							1	Harley Jo	You heard me. This is what we're gonna do next.	2																					
84	84		202							2					1																			
85	85		301									Harley Jo flips over his backpack and pours out a pile of these devices, all stacking up into a small hill by his feet.																						
86	86		201							1	500374	4																						
87	87		201							1	500372																							
88	88		301							1	Harley Jo	I'll be calibrating them, and Yata will be deploying them. As long as they aren't destroyed, we can contact Babylonia when the network of these amplifiers reaches a certain scale, even with the comms interference.	1																					
89	89		201							1	500374	4																						
90	90		301							1	Yata	Tsk. Sounds like a lot of work.	1																					
91	91		201							1	500372																							
92	92		301							1	Harley Jo	Someone has to do it.	1																					
93	93		201							1	500374	4																						
94	94		301							1	Yata	...Fine. You're my temporary commandant, so I'll listen to you. Criticism can wait 'til it's over.	1																					
95	95		202							1	2				1																			
96	96		401							1	41																							
97	97		201							1	500286																							
98	98		301							1	Hans	Alright, break's over. All teams, we'll advance in wedge formation. Egret will lead; Gray Raven and my team will take the rear.	1																					
99	99		301								Hans	Harley Jo and Yata will stay behind the team to take care of whatever enemy remains and deploy the comms amplifiers. Simon's team will cover them during setup.	1																					
100	100		202							1					1																			
101	101		301									Hans gives every one of you your orders, turning the different teams into tightly-connected gears, each of you in your most suitable position with your duties.																						
102	102		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					He winds up the war machine that is you all, the elites of Babylonia, and you march on toward CPF 040.
