11	11		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						His silvery black mechanical frame is exposed, and the air is filled with the smell of vital fluid. It is deeply disturbing.																						
12	12		301									Despite not relenting in his words, Changyu seems relieved to find someone here to rescue him. Losing that last bit of strength, he no longer can support himself and falls.

18	18		302								You've heard of that system?	19	Wasn't she dual-wielding pistols like you?	20																				
19	19	21	301								Lee	I read it in the Babylonia database. A support system themed after harvests, I didn't expect it to be applied to a frame of another type.																						
20	20		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lee	I always find that designation insulting... The weapons you use don't define what type of Construct you are.
