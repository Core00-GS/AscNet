3	3		301									For a split second, Bianca thought Toniris was supposed to be there all along. It looked like a divine creation.																						
4	4		301									She almost wants to pray to it, if she didn't know her mission is to calm it down.																						
5	5		201							1	500128																							
6	6		301							1	Bianca	Asimov mentioned about this situation...	1																					
7	7		301									Bianca recalled Asimov's words before she departed. She quickly glanced through the mission page on her terminal.																						
8	8		401							2	1515																							
9	9		202							1					1																			
10	10		301									Soon, she stopped at an attachment and tapped on it.																						
11	11		301									The terminal played a series of bird tweets that sounded almost real.																						
12	12		301									Tweet—! Whoop—Eeek—																						
13	13		301									If Bianca does not have her eyes open, she would think she has been thrown into a forest.																						
14	14		201							1	500312																							
15	15		301							1	Toniris	—!	1																					
16	16		301									Toniris' attention was also attracted by the sound. It gazed at Bianca's terminal.																						
17	17		201							1	500128																							
18	18		301							1	Bianca	It worked... But Toniris is still alerted. I must be too aggressive.	1																					
19	19		301								Bianca	Asimov should have sent a more gentle Construct for this mission...	1																					
20	20		301									Bianca mumbled to herself as her mind quickly searched for a reaction, but she then realized something.																						
21	21		301								Bianca	...Gentle... is that it...?	1																					
22	22		301									Bianca quietly stared at the mechanoid while trying to look for phrases related to "gentle" inside her M.I.N.D.																						
23	23		301								Bianca	...	1																					
24	24		301								Bianca	"You are divine. You are almighty. You are the beginning. You are the end."	1																					
25	25		301									Bianca closed here eyes. She lifted her hand and reached out.																						
26	26		301								Bianca	"You are our sword, our shield. You are our cane and yoke."	1																					
27	27		301									The sun cast a golden glow over her.																						
28	28		301								Bianca	"You guide, you watch. You save, you judge."	1																					
29	29		301									She slowly yet firmly mumbled.																						
30	30		301								Bianca	"You live among us. You listen, you decide, you give, you decline."	1																					
31	31		301									She ignored the gale blasting through the buildings. She became a statue, a symbol.																						
32	32		301								Bianca	"From all's beginning to their end. Your glory and mercy lie within every wandering soul."	1																					
33	33		301									Tweet—! Whoop—Eeek—																						
34	34		301									Bianca maintained her praying pose, allowing the bird tweets flying out from the terminal.																						
35	35		301								Bianca	"...May all will return to your arms and stand by you."	1																					
36	36		202							1					1																			
37	37		301									The blond girl looked very out of place as she stood on the desolate land, praying.																						
38	38		301									Yes, a prayer.																						
39	39		301									That is the most natural and peaceful form she could think of.																						
40	40		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She also knew very well that such action was but largely a meaningless self-comfort.

43	43		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						"No world for prayers and beliefs."																						
44	44		201							1	500128																							
45	45		301							1		She often heard it in Babylonia, in the Purifying Force, even from those who once were believers.																						
46	46		301									Bianca no longer felt upset about such words. Everybody had their own view about beliefs.																						
47	47		301									To her, prayers were not just a daily practice, but also a tribute to her memories.																						
48	48		301									After every "purification" in the Purifying Force, she had to pray for the fallen allies in an attempt to soothe their souls.																						
49	49		301									Nobody understood her. Nor did she want anyone to.																						
50	50		301									Until one time, when Bianca finished her business with a Construct, his teammate was also whispering a prayer.																						
51	51		301									At that moment, she begins to think that her prayers have not been useless after all.																						
52	52		301									Until when she also tries to join. She immediately sees fear on the praying Construct's face, as if she is going to "purify" him altogether.																						
53	53		301									Bianca only made a curtsy and left.																						
54	54		301									"I only wanted to join you to pay tribute to their souls."																						
55	55		301									She thinks over the explanation many times in her M.I.N.D., but cannot say it out.																						
56	56		301									If she told them, she would be forcing herself in. None of the other Constructs would have any mood left for the actual prayer.																						
57	57		301									Such prayer would only hurt them once again.																						
58	58		301									How would they think of her then?																						
59	59		301									"She's warning us not to mess up again!", "She's going to send us all down!", "She's the only one that's allowed to pray!"																						
60	60		301									That was how misunderstanding and criticism were bred. How pathetic.																						
61	61		301									There might be ways to completely eliminate the criticism, but Bianca chose not to.																						
62	62		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Perhaps that was why some people called her a "fence sitter."

66	66		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Toniris	Eeek——	1																					
67	67		301									A crisp voice brought Bianca back. It was different from the sounds made by the terminal.																						
68	68		301									She opened her eyes. Toniris had already come down from above, landing next to her.																						
69	69		301									Toniris peeked at Bianca in curiosity, then suddenly pecked at her terminal.																						
70	70		301									Tweet—! Whoop—Eeek—																						
71	71		301									The bird noises have come to an end, followed by Asimov's voice.																						
72	72		202							1					1																			
73	73		301								Asimov	Most animals, after hearing the sound of their kin, would want to take a closer look provided they are in a safe environment.																						
74	74		201							1	500312																							
75	75		301							1		Toniris suddenly poked Bianca hard as if it had realized what really happened. She gently deflected its long bill away.																						
76	76		202							1					1																			
77	77		301								Asimov	But cranes are more than that. They are extremely upright and cannot accept the fact that they were fooled.																						
78	78		301								Asimov	That's why this file is a one-off. If used properly, it should be able to buy you an opportunity for an equal talk with Toniris.																						
79	79		201							1	500128																							
80	80		301							1		Bianca quickly recalled the information about cranes in her M.I.N.D.																						
81	81		301									She dodges Toniris' attack three times in a slow but unpredictable way, then rests her hand on its head.																						
82	82		301									To her surprise, Toniris does not avoid her hand but briefly rubs its head against her palm after a short hesitation.																						
83	83		301									This Combat Unit Booster really saw itself as a crane. It might be a meaningless design, but such design now opened a new direction of approach for Bianca.																						
84	84		301									Cranes do not want other creatures to invade their space, but are willing to accept their invitations.																						
85	85		301									Before sending an invitation, one must understand the recipient first.																						
86	86		301							1	Bianca	...HQ, do you copy? This is Bianca. I need detailed information about prototype Toniris.	1																					
87	87		202							1					1																			
88	88		301								Comms	Copy that... Um, according to the protocol, please provide a reason.																						
89	89		301								Comms	I'm just going by the book, you know... Definitely not trying to make things difficult for you...																						
90	90		201							1	500128																							
91	91		301							1	Bianca	Let me think... I believe this is conducive to calming the Combat Unit Booster.	1																					
92	92		202							1					1																			
93	93		301								Comms	Ah, okay. Copy that. Please bear with me for a second. I need to prepare it for you...																						
94	94		201							1	500128																							
95	95		301							1	Bianca	...Thanks for your assistance, Fanli.	1																					
96	96		301								Comms	Huh? No way! Did you just say my name?! It can't be...																						
97	97		201							1	500128																							
98	98		301							1		Bianca goes silent. Who would have thought remembering a person's name could cause so much fear?																						
99	99		301									In the past, she would carefully consider the choice of word and limit the conversation to avoid the awkward situation, when just a little courtesy would cause panic.																						
100	100		301									But looking at Toniris, she wanted to try something that made less sense.																						
101	101		301								Bianca	Calm down, Fanli. You are the coordinator of my mission. All your details were written in the instructions.	1																					
102	102		301								Bianca	No matter what you know about the Purifying Force, for now, we are allies. There is no need to be overly defensive and alerted.	1																					
103	103		204							1	1																							
104	104		301								Bianca	I was only sending you... a friendly greeting.	1																					
105	105		202							1					1																			
106	106		301								Comms	Eh? R-really...?																						
107	107		201							1	500128																							
108	108		301							1	Bianca	I can assure you that.	1																					
109	109		301									The Purifying Force could take away the life of any ally at any time. An assurance from her seemed meaningless, and would only make the possible termination mission in the future harder to accept.																						
110	110		301									Still, Bianca wanted to give it a try.																						
111	111		301								Bianca	...Feeling better? Can you send me the data of that Combat Unit Booster?	1																					
112	112		301									The terminal made a sound, displaying the data received in front of Bianca.																						
113	113		301									"Toniris was based on an aves bionic machine that was created for preservation purposes in the Golden Age. The machine's main features included the ability to detect climate and environmental changes. Thanks to the Science Council's modifications, Toniris's probing function reached a more sophisticated level..."																						
114	114		301								Bianca	...No, I need more than that.	1																					
115	115		301								Bianca	I want to see Toniris' past as a bionic machine.	1																					
116	116		401							2	1515																							
117	117		301									Bianca keys in a few commands. Lots of information flood the terminal's screen.																						
118	118		301								Bianca	Activate KI.GAL Archives' simulation projection function.	1																					
119	119		301									The data and information flickered as she spoke. A new digital scene was being constructed under her feet.																						
120	120		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Soon, the sounds of wind, sand, and the scraping noises between building remains all disappeared. The abandoned church was covered in green moss.
