6	6		301								Kamui	Without the protective gear, I'm sure we'd be infected if we got any closer... What a creepy thing.	2																					
7	7		202							1	2				1																			
8	8		301									Though sealed in the airtight container, the sample is still attempting to flow toward the Red Tide as if it is alive. It also continues to produce small Hetero-Creatures.

10	10		201							2	500273		400																					
11	11		301							1	Kamui	As if it's trying to get back to its mother. Is it alive...?	1																					
12	12		301								Wanshi	Asimov indeed believes that the Red Tide is a form of biologically evolved Punishing Virus.	2																					
13	13		301								Wanshi	Looks like the Hetero-Creatures are by-products of the Red Tide, but further studies will need to be conducted in order to understand their source and how they are formed.	2																					
14	14		301								Kamui	Wanshi isn't falling asleep for once. That's rare.	1																					
15	15		301								Wanshi	...Old habits die hard. But that's irrelevant now.	2																					
16	16		202							1	2				1																			
17	17		301									Wanshi looks back at the Red Tide. It has slowed down and formed a decent-sized lake in the lower grounds of the city.																						
18	18		301									The sunlight shimmers on the quiet crimson liquid that swallows life and death wherever it goes...																						
19	19		301									Then Wanshi hears the whispers in the Red Tide.

24	24		301								Wanshi	Don't you hear that?	2

28	28		301							1	Chrome	The creatures are talking in the Red Tide... No, they sound more like... data fragments?	1																					
29	29		301								Chrome	It's meaningless. Don't let it distract you.	1

32	32		202							1					1																			
33	33		301									Even so, an eerie silence still envelops them. The whispers in the Red Tide flood into their ears and wraps around them like a perpetual shadow.																						
34	34		301									It is not until the vibration and rumbling in the distance break the silence that the three wake up from the trance and look for the source of the commotion.																						
35	35		301									The hissing of the Hetero-Creatures and the sound of the greatsword slashing echo above the empty city.																						
36	36		301									Mixed with familiar angry roars.

43	43		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						They arrive just in time to see Camu fling a sticky Hetero-Creature off his greatsword with disgust. The creature splats on the wall behind Chrome then slowly slides down. Its mucus splashes onto the hem of Chrome's pants.

52	52		201							1	500175																							
53	53		301							1	Camu	I'm immune to it, but you might not be. Don't come closer if you don't have to.	1																					
54	54		301									Camu lifts a finger to point at the Hetero-Creature remnants and "blood" all over his body.																						
55	55		201							1	1081001	1																						
56	56		301							1	Kamui	Nah. A part of our mission is to collect Red Tide samples, so we all put on full protective gear before we landed. Don't worry about us!	1

63	63		301								Kamui	I don't fight like that...	1																					
64	64		301									Camu puts the greatsword on his back and kicks the pile of Hetero-Creature limbs away, then walks toward the Strike Hawks. Kamui finally gets a good look at all the filth on Camu.

69	69		301							1	Camu	So what's the situation? What are you all doing here?	1																					
70	70		301								Chrome	We received a direct order from President Hassen to look for the Gray Ravens. They...	2																					
71	71		301								Camu	Lost all contact, right? The guy with a disgusting smile told me the same thing and gave me a few possible coordinates. I've sifted through them, however...	1																					
72	72		301									Camu takes out the screen and pulls up the map.																						
73	73		301								Camu	The closest coordinates are underground. I circled around this area but I didn't find an entrance.	1																					
74	74		301								Chrome	There's an underground shelter below the city. I'm sure there are more than one entrances. If only we can find the blueprint of the underground facilities...	2																					
75	75		301								Camu	Pointless.	1																					
76	76		301								Camu	All the possible entrances have been blocked off.	1																					
77	77		301								Chrome	What's...	2																					
78	78		301									Camu points at the Red Tide puddles on the ground.																						
79	79		301								Camu	Unless you want to dive underwater to open the door?	1

83	83		301							1	Kamui	...That might be a little challenging.	1																					
84	84		301								Wanshi	It feels like someone is intentionally trying to stop us. Where does the Red Tide come from? Is it sentient or is someone manipulating it?	2																					
85	85		201							1	500175		400																					
86	86		201							2	500155		-400																					
87	87		301							1	Camu	Hmph. Every time I tried to get closer to those coordinates, these disgusting things would swarm at me.	1																					
88	88		301								Chrome	Other squads are also looking for Huaxu. Their protective gear isn't as strong as ours, so they might not be able to get past the Red Tide.	2																					
89	89		301								Chrome	If we can't find a way to go underground, we should at least ensure the safety of our ground support.	2																					
90	90		301								Chrome	Kamui, you work with Camu. Continue to look for the Gray Ravens.	2																					
91	91		301								Chrome	Wanshi and I will connect with the other squads. We need to sync our information and make sure that there is enough support to handle any situation.	2
