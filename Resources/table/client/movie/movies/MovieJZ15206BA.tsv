7	7		301								Qu	The outside worldâ€”what a strange word. I don't know how many years have passed since that battle.	1																					
8	8		301								???	Yeah, I remember the battle. It was from that point on that you took on the mantle as the KCC Gravekeeper.																						
9	9		301								???	Such valor.																						
10	10		301								Qu	I guess I'll take that as a compliment.	1																					
11	11		301								???	Hehe, well then... Welcome to a new world.																						
12	12		301								Qu	Quit being polite, hypocrite.	1

22	21		301							1	GDF Soldier B	What about the Support Force? Where are they?	1																					
23	22		301								GDF Soldier C	Radar indicates that most of the squads have evacuated... We've been abandoned!	1

33	32		301									Suddenly, a girl infiltrates the base and interrupts the soldiers.																						
34	33		301									She quickly slashes the Corrupted with her glaive, then charges up and throws her weapon at the enemies behind her. The inertia from the impact sends enemies flying back over ten meters before they crash onto the ground.																						
35	34		301									She lifts her right hand slightly, and a new glaive forms in her hand.																						
36	35		201							1	500005																							
37	36		301							1	GDF Soldier A	It's a Construct!	1																					
38	37		301								GDF Soldier C	No, that can't be. My detector indicates that she's reacting with the Punishing Virus. C-Corrupted!	1																					
39	38		201							1	500150

42	41		301									Qu leads the charge outside of the base and begins to fight the Corrupted.																						
43	42		301									Qu may be skilled, but fighting the vast number of Corrupted while also trying to suppress the Punishing Virus from spreading to the other soldiers pushes her to her limits.																						
44	43		301									Now that the battle is over, Qu and the remaining soldier stand in the ruins of the base.

49	48		301								GDF Soldier A	You did your best given the number of enemies...	1																					
50	49		301								Qu	Do you need me to escort you back?	2																					
51	50		301								GDF Soldier A	That won't be necessary. The main army has abandoned us, so going back will only make it worse. I've heard of a place called "Oasis" nearby... Want to come along?	1																					
52	51		301								GDF Soldier A	You show signs of Corrupted, but I'm sure we can avoid a fight if you explain yourself clearly.	1																					
53	52		301								Qu	I'd better not. I think that would only bring harm to both sides.	2																					
54	53		301								GDF Soldier A	If you say so...	1

56	55		301									Hearing this, the soldier salutes Qu. But the soldier has only taken one step after turning to leave before kneeling.

79	78		301									These are the themes of this era that shape the world.																						
80	79		301									The Punishing Virus has ravaged humanity during their desperate struggle to survive in this post-apocalyptic world.																						
81	80		301									Knowledge claimed there was no purgatory; there was no hell. But now I see it. Hell is right in front of me.																						
82	81		301									Humanity's miserable existence is now on the verge of collapse.																						
83	82		301									They perish amid struggle, suffering, and torture.

86	85		301								Qu	But I can't bear to see you continue suffering from reality.	1																					
87	86		301								Qu	Someone must always bear the cross, even if in infamy. That is the Sovereign's duty.	1																					
88	87		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	It is the duty of the Sovereign to protect that which is precious to them.	1

93	93		301							1	Qu	Yes, only by sending those sky dwellers down can we end all of humanity's suffering in an instant.	1																					
94	94		301								Qu	They won't have to continue struggling in this tragic era. Everyone can live forever in the virtual world.	1																					
95	96		301								Huaxu	As you wish.																						
96	98		301								Qu	From now on, Huaxu, direct all computing power into collecting and backing up the consciousness models for all of mankind. The Tabula Akasha can no longer be confined to just Kowloong.	1																					
97	99		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	All of mankind should be recorded in history and jointly welcome the arrival of a new era.	1
