5	5		301								Norman	There was a bunch of happy rabbits. Every day they enjoyed a meal of carrots that grew from the earth. Their lives were blissful, free from worry.	1																					
6	6		301								Norman	One day, they discovered that carrots bathed in the moonlight would become even sweeter and tastier. The gears in their little brains started turning...	1																					
7	7		301								Norman	"Wouldn't it be great if we could eat these extra sweet carrots all the time?" "Why don't we just keep the Moon with us, then?"	1																					
8	8		301								Norman	"How would we do that?" "Hold her back! Hold her back!" "Grab a rope! Let's pull the Moon back!"	1																					
9	9		301								Norman	Eager to taste the sweetest carrots ever, the rabbits worked together, twisting and weaving the carrot leaves until they made a long, long rope.	1																					
10	10		301								Norman	"Hi-yah! Hi-yah!" They finally grabbed ahold of the Moon. Using their combined might, the rabbits tried their hardest to tie down the Moon in the sky.	1																					
11	11		301								Norman	"We'll soon get our bellies full!" "We'll soon get our bellies full!" The rabbits cheered and chanted...	1

118	117		301								Norman	But the sweet, sweet carrots were all the rabbits could think about, so they wouldn't let go of their rope. Eventually, the Moon pulled them away, and the rabbits ended up on the surface of the Moon, never to return.	1																					
119	118		301								Norman	So what? The rabbits wouldn't worry about that, obviously. They honestly thought the Moon was theirs! They cheered triumphantly—after all... they were just a bunch of happy rabbits.	1

158	157		301							1		Liszt nods before entering some data on the screen next to him, projecting them onto the holo-screen.																						
159	158		301								Liszt	According to the information the military has published, our Task Force—when compared with the data of previous battles—is spent way beyond what is acceptable.	1																					
160	159		301								Liszt	Given their current strength, dare I say that the Task Force can't even guard Babylonia against the evolving Hetero-Creatures. Destroying them on a meaningful scale and reclaiming the conservation areas is a pipe dream.	1																					
161	160		301									Liszt pauses, his gaze sweeping across the hall, and he lets the deafening silence flood the room.																						
162	161		301								Liszt	I have no intention to blame the military command or our Task Force... but even with their exceptional service, our fight against the Punishing Virus is still resulting in heavy loss.	1																					
163	162		204							1	8																							
164	163		301								Liszt	Indeed. The battles are much crueler than these numbers. Constructs and commandants were performing their duties to reclaim the earth when they met their ill-fated ends, combating enemies beyond our understanding.	1

170	169		301									Looking into Liszt's eyes intently, Nikola has a feeling that this man must have a card up his sleeve. He would not have incited the council members otherwise.																						
171	170		301								Liszt	I don't object to reclaiming the earth. It is our past—our future, even! But we must ask ourselves: is it time for us to consider another path?	1

174	173		301							1	Hilda	If we stop fighting and let the Punishing Virus spread, the people will suffer, and Babylonia won't remain unscathed. We can't be sure that the fully evolved Hetero-Creatures and Corrupted wouldn't destroy this ark.	1

181	181		301								Nikola	Since you didn't forget, I'm sure you'll also recall that Babylonia can only run on regular fuel right now. The zero-point engine designed to power Babylonia originally was the reason this apocalypse started.	2

190	190		301									After a brief silence, the room explodes with questions. All the council members are stunned by Liszt's words, eager to know more about the thing he said—zero-point energy.																						
191	191		401							1	201																							
192	192		301								Liszt	As you all know, during a not-so-secret military operation, the Gray Raven Commandant retrieved a file from Atlantis, the zero-point research city.	1																					
193	193		301									Liszt changes the displayed content on the holo-screen into the Omega File, the data with which the Atlantis researchers trade their lives.																						
194	194		301								Liszt	This is an incredibly valuable file. It shows us that, under specific conditions, a running zero-point reactor can create a field that "absorbs" the Punishing Virus.	1

200	200		203							1	0.25																							
201	201		301								Liszt	Exactly. However... those noble researchers have perhaps left us with an even more significant insight.	1																					
202	202		301									Nodding, Liszt turns to the next page of his presentation.																						
203	203		301								Liszt	During their research, they tried to recreate the process of how the zero-point reactor created the Punishing Virus. They documented their experiments, hoping to leave behind valuable data.	1																					
204	204		301								Liszt	While they never saw the virus manifest, those researchers still preserved the Omega File alongside all the data from running their zero-point reactor.	1

209	209		301								Liszt	Indeed. This will be our basis for restarting the zero-point reactor... The last torch of humanity's future is burning 363,300 kilometers from the earth now—right there on the Moon.	1																					
210	210		202							1	2																							
211	212		301									All the council members gasp, almost all of them turning toward the Moon that is seemingly just outside their grasp.																						
212	214		301									To test how zero-point energy would perform under low gravity in space, Babylonia's zero-point reactor and the manufacture of its engine were sent to the propulsion lab on the Moon during Babylonia's production.																						
213	215		301									Upon discovering the connection between zero-point reactors and the Punishing Virus, the reactor and the lunar base that housed it have been discarded, now managed by Norman Mining Corp, the lunar mining company.

223	225		301								Liszt	Our test finds the lunar reactor running only at 45.37% of its theoretical capacity when replicating the data from the Atlantis reactor.	1																					
224	226		301								Liszt	But that is enough to sustain Babylonia's current operation and future voyage—the most important thing is there has been no sign of the Punishing Virus at our test site, which means...	1																					
225	227		301								Liszt	We can attach the zero-point engine to Babylonia and use its almost-limitless energy to turn Babylonia back into a colony ship as we set sail for the stars away from Earth.	1																					
226	228		301									This will mean the Punishing Virues-infected planet and its myriad of dangers will no longer concern Babylonia. Humanity would begin anew—which is undoubtedly a very tempting proposition given the current situation.

229	231		301							1	Nikola	Hmph... Only if your data is reliable. Even the Norman Mining Corp doesn't possess researchers experienced with zero-point reactors and colony ships. I have every right to doubt the legitimacy of this report.	2																					
230	232		301									Nikola might have called them Norman Mining Corp's researchers, but he knows very well that it must be Kurono scientists on the lunar surface right now.																						
231	233		301								Liszt	Our researchers aren't the only ones... We only managed to restart this project because we received assistance from an expert on Babylonia and zero-point energy. Commander Nikola must know our expert very well.	1

233	234		301									Only now does Nikola realize. He always thought that he was the one using Kurono, but he was never aware that Kuono was using him as well.																						
234	236		301								Nikola	Karenina...	2																					
235	237		301								Liszt	Indeed. Karenina from the Engineering Force might be the most knowledgeable person on Babylonia's design. And despite the study on zero-point energy having stopped for years, she remains one of its leading researchers.	1																					
236	238		301									More importantly, Karenina is a member of Babylonia. Her position is above reproach...																						
237	239		301								Liszt	Well, I believe the idea to relaunch Babylonia's voyage is convincing enough for a proposal then, President Hassen?	1

241	243		301								Hassen	We'll begin our vote on Councilman Liszt's proposal.	1																					
242	244		301									Without much discussion, an overwhelming majority has voted to restart the zero-point reactor and leave the ever-growing threats of the surface, turning humanity's gaze toward the unknown stars.

251	253		301								Gestalt	98.5% are in favor of Councilman Liszt's proposal, 0% have opposed, and 1.5% have abstained. The supporting rate is higher than the minimum requirements. This proposal has passed.
