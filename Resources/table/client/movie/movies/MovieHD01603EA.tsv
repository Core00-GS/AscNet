115	115		301									Seeing her all excited about coming up with plans for your retirement, you aren't quite sure if you want to cut her off.

152	152		301									Starting light, however, the duet slowly turns into an unsettling quick march...																						
153	153		301									While you can't be sure if this is happening because she's being influenced by her M.I.N.D. or whether it's because she's feeling temporarily comfortable enough to show her true self with her M.I.N.D. shard now back to herself...																						
154	154		301									You are taken aback nonetheless seeing Liv putting herself first, which is something she rarely ever does.
