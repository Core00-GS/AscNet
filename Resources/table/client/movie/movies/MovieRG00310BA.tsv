5	5		301			DialogEnable				1	Lucia	Thinking about it, Commandant must have formed a team with Vera, Camu, and Karenina, is that right?	1																					
6	6		301								Lee	I guess so, if there are only two teams. Must be very dangerous... Vera has always had her eyes on Commandant, not to mention Karenina and Camu.	2																					
7	7		301								Lucia	But they can't do anything in the game world, can they? At least Commandant's teammates all hate to lose.	1																					
8	8		301								Lucia	I think their priority is to finish the game and win over us. I just hope Commandant can get used to the situation over there.	1																					
9	9		301									After leaving the spawn point, three of them walked in the countryside. Lee and Lucia were thinking of the game's settings, while Kamui was running in front to explore the surroundings.

20	20		301							1	Kamui	No, it's a stone monument. Just come check it out!	1																					
21	21		301									Two of them ran to Kamui and saw a old-looking stone monument.																						
22	22		301									It was pretty dirty, but the text on it was still barely readable.

26	26		301							1	Lee	Is this about the game world?	2																					
27	27		301								Kamui	Yeah, I was expecting an NPC to introduce the background settings in this kind of game, but a stone monument isn't too bad either.	3																					
28	28		301									Lucia started reading the monument.																						
29	29		301								Lucia	Ever since the Goddess created this world, the war between humans and Demons had never stopped. Demons were born with great strength, so humans could only fall back into their cities.	1																					
30	30		301								Lucia	Just when everybody thought humans would be driven to extinction, a few heroes arrived at the Land of Origin from afar.	1																					
31	31		301								Lucia	They were wearing exotic outfits, using strange weapons. They came with a divine revelation.	1																					
32	32		301								Lucia	The heroes finally helped humans to defeat the Demon King. Just when others were about to thank the heroes, they turned into light and disappeared in the sky.	1																					
33	33		301								Lucia	Just like how they arrived.	1																					
34	34		301								Lucia	Led by their King, the humans started to strike back at the Demons with the aim to completely eliminate them. Without the Demon King, the Demons didn't stand a chance.	1																					
35	35		301								Lucia	The Demons have not given up, for they still have the Goddess's artifact. It is said that the four fragments of the artifact would become one when the time comes.	1																					
36	36		301								Lucia	And the Demons will gain a power so great that it can help them conquer the world.	1																					
37	37		301								Lucia	Is that all...?	1																					
38	38		301								Lee	To sum it up, the humans were losing before the heroes showed up, but after they arrived, the Demons started to lose all the way.	2																					
39	39		301								Lee	This is what happens when one side of the war has too much power. The humans and Demons in this world are no different. I don't like them.	2																					
40	40		301								Kamui	Well, this kind of setting has been quite popular recently. There's no absolute right or wrong. Anyway, have you not realized the most important thing?	3																					
41	41		301								Lee	Are you talking about... The Goddess' artifact?	2																					
42	42		301								Kamui	Yeah. We don't know what the fragments actually look like, but we definitely need to collect them.	3																					
43	43		301								Lee	I'm more concerned with the Goddess herself.	2																					
44	44		301								Lucia	We can keep an eye on them. But the top priority right now is to find Liv.	1																					
45	45		301								Lee	Let's continue heading toward the castle then. But there are two split roads...	2																					
46	46		301								Lee	One obviously takes us to the castle. But the other one goes to a village...?	2																					
47	47		301								Kamui	Let's go to the village then!	3																					
48	48		301								Lee	Wait a sec, Kamui. Why are we going there?	2																					
49	49		301								Kamui	Because side quests are usually picked up from there. Sometimes, we can only find useful clues from side quests.	3																					
50	50		301								Kamui	Trust me, I have a lot of experience.	3																					
51	51		301								Lee	Game experience, huh... Lucia, what do you think?	2																					
52	52		301								Lucia	Let's do what Kamui said. If we go to the castle, we may only get the info about our main objective, but the villagers could have seen Liv.	1																					
53	53		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Kamui	Let's go then!	3
