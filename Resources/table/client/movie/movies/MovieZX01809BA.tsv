12	12		301								Hans	Connect me to President Hassen. I have a status report.	1																					
13	13		301								Celica	Transferring comms.	2

15	15		301							1	Hassen	What is it, Hans?	2																					
16	16		301								Hans	We have found a number of refugees in the attack zone.	1																					
17	17		301								Hassen	Understood.	2																					
18	18		301								Hans	...	1																					
19	19		301								Hassen	Anything else?	2																					
20	20		301								Hans	Shall we proceed according to the plan?	1																					
21	21		301								Hassen	What do you suggest?	2																					
22	22		301								Hans	The other two calibration teams are still en route, but according to visual estimates, the Red Tide is spreading faster than expected. Teams will have to adjust their node positions accordingly to expand the blast area.	1																					
23	23		301								Hans	We can only rely on hand-held devices for surveying and mapping, which significantly delays the time in which we can execute the plan.	1																					
24	24		301								Hans	Considering the time required to change orbit and for Babylonia to charge the arsenal, combined with the terrain nearby and the mobility speed of the troops, it will take at least ten hours to ensure that all nodes are deployed.	1																					
25	25		301								Hans	By that time, the Red Tide will inevitably spread to an area less than ten kilometers away from the refugee camp.	1																					
26	26		301								Hans	To be on the safe side, I don't suggest relocating the nodes. Otherwise, I can't guarantee that the attack range will completely cover the Red Tide.	1																					
27	27		301								Hans	We have issued an emergency evacuation order to the refugees, but they are unwilling to vacate the area.	1																					
28	28		301								Hassen	How do you wish to proceed?	2																					
29	29		204							1	3																							
30	30		301								Hans	Although the World Government Parliament has been relocated to space with the Eden-class Babylonia, the people on the surface are still our comrades.	1																					
31	31		301								Hans	We are all citizens of the World Government. Citizens must fulfill their basic obligations, including cooperating with the army in emergency asylum.	1																					
32	32		301								Hans	According to the instructions of Article 21 of "The World Government Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act"—If civilians are found while executing a mission, they must be notified and evacuated to safety.	1																					
33	33		204							1																								
34	34		301								Hans	Unfortunately, it appears that they are unwilling to evacuate.	1																					
35	35		301								Hans	According to the instructions of Article 22 of "The World Government Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act"—If civilians insist on remaining within the boundaries of an operation, military forces are authorized to forcefully remove all civilians.	1																					
36	36		301								Hassen	You know quite well.	2																					
37	37		301								Hans	I have committed all of the rules and regulations to memory, even if they are no longer applicable in this era.	1																					
38	38		301								Hans	Please allow me to evacuate these refugees under the pretense of successfully deploying the domain nodes— with or without force.	1																					
39	39		301								Hassen	Request granted. Evacuate the civilians by any means necessary.	2																					
40	40		301								Hassen	But remember, Babylonia will only initiate the attack once node deployment has been authenticated, regardless if the evacuation is a success or not.	2																					
41	41		301								Hassen	We have only one chance. This is for all of humanity.	2																					
42	42		301								Hans	Understood.	1																					
43	43		301								Hassen	Any other issues?	2																					
44	44		301								Hans	No, sir. Report complete, Mr. President.	1																					
45	45		301								Hassen	Wait.	2																					
46	46		301								Hans	What is it, Mr. President?	1																					
47	47		301								Hassen	...	2																					
48	48		301								Hassen	Hans, you experienced the Great Evacuation first hand. You're one of the most experienced soldiers in active service.	2																					
49	49		301								Hassen	You should know why I entrusted you to be the commander of this operation instead of handing over the task to the younger generation.	2																					
50	50		301								Hassen	For example, the up-and-coming Gray Raven Commandant.	2																					
51	51		301								Hans	I don't, Mr. President.	1																					
52	52		301								Hans	My duty is to obey orders. Soldiers don't need to speculate on any factors other than their mission.	1																					
53	53		301								Hassen	Is that really how you feel, Hans?	2																					
54	54		301								Hans	...	1																					
55	55		301								Hassen	A soldier is not only a member of the army, but also a member of humanity.	2																					
56	56		301								Hassen	Young soldiers tend to forget the former due to the latter.	2																					
57	57		301								Hassen	Only after refining themselves over a lengthy military career will they steel their judgement.	2																					
58	58		301								Hans	So you have tasked me with this mission because I have the necessary experience, and you trust my judgment.	1																					
59	59		301								Hassen	Not only that.	2																					
60	60		301								Hassen	Judgment entails responsibility. When passing judgment, you must bear the full weight of its consequences.	2																					
61	61		301								Hassen	Night is too heavy for the dawn of a new era.	2																					
62	62		301								Hassen	I don't doubt their fearlessness in the fight against the Corrupted, but they have yet to awaken to a higher calling.	2																					
63	63		301								Hans	Yes, I understand. The responsibility of our generation should not fall on the next generation.	1																					
64	64		301								Hassen	The atrocities committed by our generation should not be repaid by future generations.	2																					
65	65		301								Hassen	Hans, I know the cruelty I ask of you.	2																					
66	66		301								Hassen	But the blood of the youth has not been cooled over many long years. Such is the same for their passion.	2																					
67	67		301								Hassen	I don't want them to lose this passion so early.	2																					
68	68		301								Hassen	So I must play the judge, and you the executioner.	2																					
69	69		204							1	3																							
70	70		301								Hans	As you wish, Mr. President.	1																					
71	71		301								Hans	When I accepted my appointment, I was ready for the worst. The current situation is within my expectations.	1																					
72	72		301								Hans	Moreover, I didn't think I would have a chance to return to the surface ever again. Thank you for giving me this opportunity.	1																					
73	73		204							1																								
74	74		301								Hassen	Such gratitude is unnecessary.	2																					
75	75		301								Hassen	Humanity may have emotions, but the universe does not.	2																					
76	76		301								Hassen	Babylonia is the scale that balances the past and future of humanity.	2																					
77	77		301								Hassen	The fulcrum between the two is a steel wire hanging over the abyss. We are the people who walk the steel wire.	2

254	251		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You return to your senses and look around. Only then do you realize that you have entered a hostile area.

256	253		301							1	Wanshi	You just started sprinting for some reason.	1																					
257	254		301								Wanshi	I thought you were going to jump into the Red Tide.	1

262	258		301									The sound interrupts Wanshi.																						
263	259		301									Unlike before, you hear the sound nearby.																						
264	260		301									Both of you turn to look toward the sound.

268	264		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You hear a thunderous buzzing in the air, but the whirlwind of sand suddenly stops.																						
269	265		301									Under the gray clouds, the sanguine Red Tide merges into a lake.																						
270	266		301									Here the tide is tranquil, reflecting like a giant mirror.																						
271	267		301									Or more accurately, it's like the calm before the storm.																						
272	268		201							1	500273

276	272		301									In the middle of the tide stands a humanoid monster resembling a skeleton.																						
277	273		301									Several steel forks of condensed Punishing Virus nail it to the center of the lake.																						
278	274		301									If it were not for this hellscape, it would seem as if it was the crucified son of God.																						
279	275		302								What's that?	276																						
280	276		301									The question seems to rouse the monster in the middle of the Red Tide. It struggles to raise its head and unleashes a dense but serene "song."

282	277		301								???	——▆▂——▄▆█——																						
283	278		301									This was the "siren's call" that you had been hearing.																						
284	279		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Then, it suddenly turns its head and looks this way. The tranquil Red Tide seems to suddenly take on life as it gradually inundates the surrounding land.
