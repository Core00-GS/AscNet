4	4		301								Yata	Another 300m!																						
5	5		301								Yata	Two hundred meters!																						
6	6		301								Valeria	We won't make it at this rate!																						
7	7		301								Yata	Take my hand!																						
8	8		301									Valeria grips Yata's hand. Yata then somersaults into the air and flings Valeria away from danger.																						
9	9		301									Then Yata kicks on a nearby wall, hard, and follows Valeria's trail.																						
10	10		301									The two of them roll into safety.																						
11	11		301								Yata	Shiva! Deactivate the immersion program!																						
12	12		301								Shiva	Understood!																						
13	13		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Before the Terrapods can catch up to the two of them, they both vanish from the virtual space.

17	17		301								Valeria	...That's what happened in the mission.																						
18	18		301								Valeria	We couldn't capture the invader. We'll take responsibility for failing the mission.

20	20		301							1	Nikola	No. Your mission is duly completed.	1																					
21	21		301								Valeria	?																						
22	22		301								Nikola	You are the failsafe in case the "invader" flops. If he did not manage to finish the mission, you would have been the ones to follow up and retrieve the data.	1																					
23	23		301								Valeria	...																						
24	24		301								Yata	...Tch, guess we're the backup after all, huh.																						
25	25		301								Nikola	It's all to ensure the mission succeeds.	1																					
26	26		301								Valeria	...																						
27	27		301								Nikola	Any other questions?	1																					
28	28		301								Valeria	Who was the target?																						
29	29		301								Nikola	...	1																					
30	30		301								Nikola	Let's call him an untested friend for now. That's all I can tell you.	1																					
31	31		301								Valeria	Very well. Then that's all.																						
32	32		301								Nikola	Did he say something to you?	1																					
33	33		301								Valeria	...No.																						
34	34		301								Nikola	...Noted.	1																					
35	35		301								Nikola	Well then, go on and finish the mission. Retrieve the files.	1																					
36	36		301								Valeria	But we've lost him already, if we have to search for him again...																						
37	37		301								Nikola	You don't have to. He should still be in the archives in the Intelligence Agency. There's a set of terminals that can link to Gestalt.	1																					
38	38		301								Nikola	He should have just disengaged from the immersion. His makeshift terminal should require quite some time to recover from.	1																					
39	39		301								Nikola	You still have time to intercept him. I'll give you the coordinates.	1																					
40	40		301								Valeria	...Roger.																						
41	41		301								Nikola	Good. No pointless questions. That's what you're best at.	1																					
42	42		301								Valeria	...Indeed. No questions.

44	44		301									Without a word, Valeria turns and leaves.
