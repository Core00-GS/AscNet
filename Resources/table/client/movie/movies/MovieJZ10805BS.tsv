55	52		301								Cyril	January 22nd, 2161. The northern defense was breached by Corrupted due to a mistake of the local army. Mercenary squad "Oasis" was hired to make up for the lack of troops.	1																					
56	53		301								Cyril	Oasis Squad persisted in the snow for a week and rescued all the civilians in a church. Fifty-two KIA.	1																					
57	54		301								Cyril	That's all the record they had in Babylonia's system.	1

61	58		301								Watanabe	Albert, we call him green-head. Gaza, always had mint leaves with him. Coates, he came from Islay Islands, just like you and Bruce...	1																					
62	59		301								Watanabe	No matter what... I cannot give a reasonable explanation for that list. But what I know is...	1																					
63	60		301								Watanabe	Those people evacuated to Babylonia... The first batch of them were researchers of anti-Punishing technology.	1																					
64	61		301								Watanabe	The second batch is... It may sound like an excuse to you.	1																					
65	62		301								Watanabe	But they're necessary for regulating society and spreading culture after the war ends.	1																					
66	63		301								Watanabe	We live in a dark era, but we need someone to look to the future.	1

82	79		301							1	Watanabe	He said you were a great pilot. He looked up to you. He became a mercenary because he wanted to become one like you.	1																					
83	80		301								Watanabe	He never hated anyone, even after the war took his family.	1																					
84	81		301								Watanabe	My biggest regret... Is that I couldn't save him.	1																					
85	82		301								Watanabe	Bruce was unique. But his legacy will go on. I will never stop fighting on this land, even just for his sake.	1																					
86	83		301								Watanabe	I will carry on his legacy.	1
