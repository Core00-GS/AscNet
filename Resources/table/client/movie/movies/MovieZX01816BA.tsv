20	20		301									While Wanshi is thinking about what to say, the old man takes the initiative.																						
21	21		301								???	Hey, what the hell are you?	2																					
22	22		301								Wanshi	Huh?	1																					
23	23		301								???	You look like a human, but there ain't a single human thing aboutcha.	2																					
24	24		301								???	You're obviously a machine, but you ain't acting like those crazy ****ers wanderin' around outside. Who are you and whatcha doin' here?	2																					
25	510		204							2	1																							
26	25		301								???	Choose your words carefully. Dependin' on your answer, you'll either be greeted with a bullet from my gun or a good mornin' kiss.	2

29	27		301								???	Huh? What the hell is a Construct?	2																					
30	28		301									And with that, the old man aims his rifle at Wanshi's forehead.																						
31	29		301								Wanshi	Don't you know...? It's a bit of hassle to explain. In short, it is a humanoid robot made of tantalum copolymer with the help of a human consciousness module...	1																					
32	30		301								???	Alright, alright, alright! Enough!	2																					
33	31		301								???	...So, they put a human brain in this tin can?	2																					
34	32		301								Wanshi	Uh... I guess you could put it like that.	1																					
35	33		301								???	****, ain't that some blasphemy. Do humans really wanna run around on Earth like that?	2																					
36	34		301									The old man spits to the side and lowers his rifle from Wanshi's forehead.																						
37	35		301								???	I ain't ever seen any fella like you before.	2																					
38	36		301								Arnold	...Construct, eh? That's a mouthful. I'll just call you by your name. Name's Arnold. What's your name?	2

43	39		301								Arnold	Anyways, looks like you've seen better days.	2																					
44	40		301								Arnold	This place has been abandoned for quite some time. I ain't seen anyone alive here in ages. How'd you end up here?	2																					
45	41		301								Wanshi	...I don't remember. I don't even know where this place is.	1																					
46	42		301								Wanshi	All I know is that the mission I was carrying out failed, so I was en route to the evac point.	1																					
47	43		301								Wanshi	And then... I, uh... just fell asleep.	1																					
48	44		301								Arnold	More like knocked the **** out. Fell asleep my ***.	2																					
49	45		301								Arnold	You were on a mission, eh...? Lookin' at your gear and nameplate, guessin' you're a soldier?	2																					
50	46		301								Wanshi	...	1																					
51	47		301								Arnold	Don't wanna tell me who ya are? Not like it matters.	2																					
52	48		301								Arnold	I wouldn't be goin' 'round runnin' my mouth tellin' my life story to folks I just met neither.	2																					
53	49		301								Wanshi	Sorry.	1																					
54	50		301								Arnold	Don't mention it. Soldiers are all the same. I get it.	2																					
55	51		301								Wanshi	Oh... You were a soldier?	1																					
56	560		204							2	1																							
57	52		301								Arnold	I just know a dumb*** war vet is all.	2																					
58	53		301								Wanshi	Sounds like you two were close...	1																					
59	54		301								Arnold	Live long enough, and you'll find yourself a few buddies. Same goes for you, right?	2																					
60	55		301								Wanshi	Uh... You could say so.	1																					
61	56		301								Wanshi	With wounds as bad as these, I can hear them yelling at me whenever I close my eyes...	1																					
62	561		204							2																								
63	57		301								Arnold	I ain't no grease monkey, but I can sure as hell say it's a miracle you made it this far.	2																					
64	58		301								Arnold	If me and my buddy hadn't kept workin' on you while you were knocked out, who knows when you'da woken up.	2																					
65	59		202							1	2				1																			
66	60		301									Just like that, a small round robot appears at Wanshi's bedside. Arnold waves to the robot, and it jumps on his shoulder. It seems that this is what Arnold calls his "buddy."

68	62		201							2	500285		400																					
69	63		301							1	Arnold	We could only patch you up a bit. After all, I ain't ever seen this kinda tech before.	2																					
70	64		301								Wanshi	Thanks... But why did you help me?	1																					
71	65		301								Arnold	Tch... Because of a promise I made with that dumb***.	2																					
72	66		301								Arnold	Of course, I got my own reasons. But that's in the past.	2																					
73	67		301								Arnold	Anyways, you're safe for now.	2																					
74	68		202							1	2																							
75	69		401							2	1516																							
76	70		301									Arnold gestures with his hand and walks over to a corner.																						
77	71		201							2	500285	1																						
78	72		301							1	Arnold	You hungry, Wanshi? I still got some canned herrin'.	2																					
79	73		203							2	0.25	400																						
80	74		201							1	500273		-400																					
81	75		301							1	Wanshi	Constructs can eat. But in theory, we don't have to.	1																					
82	76		301								Arnold	(Whistles) Ain't that convenient.	2																					
83	77		301									Arnold takes out a knife from his waistband and skillfully opens some bulging cans. Suddenly, a strange pungent smell fills the confined space and somehow manages to reactivate Wanshi's damaged smell module.																						
84	500		204							1	7																							
85	78		301								Wanshi	Phew... What's that? I think I'd have nightmares if I ate that.	1																					
86	79		301								Arnold	Kids these days. It tastes healthy and keeps you on your toes. And to think I wanted to share it with you. Guests ain't easy to come by, ya know?	2																					
87	80		301								Arnold	Now ain't like it was in the past. When I'd eat, I'd set up a table outside and ask my buddy to play my favorite bass tunes.	2																					
88	81		301								Arnold	I'd eat herrin' with crispbread, potato and butter, listen to tunes, and kick up my feet in the evenin' breeze. No people makin' a ruckus and none of these buildings blockin' my view of the sky.	2																					
89	82		301								Arnold	Moonlight and stars shinin' all over meâ€”ain't nothin' like that now.	2																					
90	83		301									After opening the can with his knife, Arnold begins munching on the fish as he reflects on scenes of his past.																						
91	84		301								Arnold	But thanks to those monsters, it ain't easy findin' supplies and I can't stay out too long.	2																					
92	85		301								Wanshi	Oh... Wow. I can't even imagine.	1																					
93	86		204							2	1																							
94	87		301								Arnold	Bahahaha! That's normal. A lotta stuff ya gotta see for yourself.	2																					
95	88		202							1	2				1																			
96	89		301									Arnold smiles and puts the last piece of fish from the can in his mouth with his knife.																						
97	90		301									Just then, Wanshi notices the sphere bot on Arnold's shoulder shutter slightly.

102	94		301								Wanshi	What is it?	1																					
103	95		301								Arnold	Ain't nothin'. I gotta go out for a sec.	2																					
104	96		204							1	7																							
105	97		301								Wanshi	Really? At a time like this?	1																					
106	98		301								Arnold	You betcha. How else would an ol' man like me still be around?	2

113	105		204							1	8																							
114	106		301									Right as Arnold leaves, Wanshi closes his eyes and begins to run diagnostics on the extent of internal damage.																						
115	107		301								Wanshi	Has the damage from the battle and the side effects from the temporary blockage now completely blocked my internal connection circuits? What a drag...	1																					
116	108		202							1					1																			
117	109		301									Looking around, a cloud of gray and yellow dust fills the underground space. The only light within the room comes from the beta lamp overhead.																						
118	110		301									On one side of the room, parts are stacked on what appears to be a mechanical workbench. However, the layer of dust indicates that these items have not been used in quite some time.																						
119	111		201							1	500273																							
120	112		301							1	Wanshi	I wonder if Troy has reached the evac point safely.	1																					
121	113		204							1	8																							
122	114		301									After thinking for a while, Wanshi shakes his head and closes his eyes.

133	502		203							1	0.25	-400																						
134	123		301							1	Arnold	Oof, today took a little longer than usual.	2																					
135	124		301									After climbing down the ladder, Arnold throws his rifle to the side and collapses on the shabby sofa in the corner.																						
136	125		301								Arnold	I dunno why, but there are more of those damn monsters wanderin' 'round outside than ever before.	2																					
137	126		301								Arnold	They're wanderin' 'round like a herd of sheep.	2																					
138	127		301								Wanshi	Could it be...	1

140	128		301								Arnold	Don't worry 'bout it. I took care of them already.	2																					
141	565		401							2	1511																							
142	129		301									Arnold reaches for his windbreaker, then quickly points his finger out in front of him like shooting a gun.																						
143	130		301								Arnold	All the top actors used to do this.	2																					
144	131		301								Wanshi	Oh... You don't say...	1																					
145	531		204							2																								
146	132		301								Arnold	Tsk, you kiddos don't understand why women used to fall head over heels for this kinda thing.	2																					
147	133		301									Arnold's mouth curls into a half-hearted smile. He crosses his legs and reclines on the sofa.																						
148	134		301								Arnold	I wonder if these monsters are actin' so strange has got somethin' to do with labelin' you as some sorta fugitive...	2																					
149	532		204							1	4																							
150	135		301								Wanshi	Yeah... I think this place is going to be crawling with danger here soon.	1

152	137		301								Arnold	Who the hell do you think I am?	2

154	533		204							1	7																							
155	139		301								Wanshi	But you don't have to do it for a stranger...	1																					
156	140		301								Arnold	I don't care even if we just met. I ain't gonna do it.	2																					
157	141		301								Arnold	Do you know what it's like livin' in a prosperous and bleak metropolis?	2																					
158	142		301								Arnold	City-folk turn a blind eye to those around 'em. That's how awful society was like during the Golden Age.	2																					
159	143		301								Arnold	Hmph. People used to care about each other.	2																					
160	144		301								Arnold	You won't read about that in those data files of yours.	2																					
161	145		301								Arnold	Changes like that in society can't be recorded in those files with just a few words or statistics.	2																					
162	146		301								Arnold	I've seen the kindness of humanity and experienced the indifference of society.	2																					
163	147		301								Arnold	Human society flourished for a time, but then they became indifferent to each other.	2																					
164	148		301								Arnold	I can't watch people survive in such indifference and selfishness. I ain't gonna join them, and I sure as hell ain't gonna be like them.	2																					
165	149		301								Arnold	But that don't mean I hate humanity. Quite the opposite actually. We can't just give up on others, no matter who it is.	2																					
166	150		301								Arnold	Callin' it "escaping" sounds nice, but it's really just weakness.	2																					
167	151		301								Arnold	I don't wanna see this kinda weakness in humanity, so that's why I live here alone with my buddy.	2																					
168	152		301								Arnold	But I still can't sit by and ignore the lives of others.	2

171	154		301								Arnold	So ya see, it's the two of us who are gonna get outta here alive.	2

173	156		301								Arnold	But I know you can't move in your condition.	2																					
174	157		301								Arnold	So, how 'bout this. I fix ya up, and we get the hell outta Dodge?	2																					
175	158		301								Wanshi	Huh?	1																					
176	159		301								Arnold	Don't underestimate this ol' timer. I used to be a doctor. That's how I've managed to modify this ol' body of mine and keep it up and running for so long.	2																					
177	160		401							2	1543

182	164		301									Arnold straightens out his clothes with one hand and pats the sphere bot on his shoulder with the other.																						
183	165		301								Arnold	Well then, tell me what I need to know to get up in there and fix those nuts and bolts of yours. I can't just go in blind. I wanna show you my handiwork.	2
