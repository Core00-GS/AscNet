3	3		301			DialogEnable						It has been a few years since the greatest calamity in human history—the Punishing Virus outbreak. Most civilizations on the planet's surface have been completely wiped out.																						
4	4		301									Once, the cities' skylines at night are brighter and more beautiful than the starry night sky. But now, the civilizations that shone in the dark are gone, replaced with darkness dimmer than space.																						
5	5		301									But one lone star shines in this dark void. Its faint light flickers as if the nights never arrive; it laughs as if there have never been any tales of sorrow.

12	12		301									The merchant raises four fingers, his teeth grinding. Seeing the girl before her still indecisive, he decides to pull his last trick.																						
13	13		301								Vendor	Fine, fine. You were asking so earnestly, so I guess it's just not my day. How about this...	1																					
14	14		301									He retracts one finger, and the girl smiles with delight, her eyes almost lighting up—not noticing the subtle smirk of the vendor behind his "disappointment," obviously.

23	23		301							1	Yoyo	You...! What do you want this time, you liar?!	1																					
24	24		301									Yoyo recognizes the man who tricked her and almost got her killed, but he does not seem to bother to acknowledge her.

27	27		301							1	Jin Man	The logo of the World Government was painted, and painted wrong, mind you... Still, the quality is acceptable. I'll wager it's worth this much—	1																					
28	28		301								Vendor	You...!	2																					
29	29		301									Jin Man raises two fingers. After a moment, he seems to have thought of something, so he retracts one, wiping away a corner of the World Government logo with the remaining finger and revealing the original logo beneath.																						
30	30		301								Jin Man	I'd clear your stock as soon as possible if I were you. Otherwise, if someone discovers your "supplier," you won't even last until the mechanoids throw you off the boat...	1																					
31	31		301									Jin Man looks up at the tallest tower on the Nighter, where one person holds everyone's life on the Nighter in the palm.																						
32	32		301									Seeing Jin Man slowly scratching away the painted logo, the vendor can only muster a twisted smile in the end, as angry as he may be.																						
33	33		301								Vendor	Ah... This gentleman's taste really is impeccable. I'll sell them at the price you offered... How many do you want?	2																					
34	34		301								Jin Man	All of them. As many as you got.	1

37	37		301								Vendor	I'm sorry, dear, but you heard him. I've sold all my stock to this gentleman here. Perhaps he's willing to share some with you...	2																					
38	38		301									Jin Man gives Yoyo a sidelong glance as if he has just noticed her.																						
39	39		201							2	500240		-400																					
40	40		301							1	Jin Man	Trades only have value when they bring profits. I'm not playing house with a girl... Although I'm surprised to see you still alive, child. What a waste of miles... Hmph, I didn't know Lady Qu had gone merciful.	2																					
41	41		301								Jin Man	Perhaps your naivety is why the folks who won't let go of the Golden Age are scouring for memories like yours as if they can get drunk with it.	2																					
42	42		301								Jin Man	Hahaha, I should thank you, by the way. Your purchase really set me up for good, so if you change your mind and want to sell your memories, give me a call... I'll give you a good deal.	2																					
43	43		301									Yoyo clutches her fists, staring furiously at the gluttonous merchant before her.																						
44	44		301								Jin Man	I'd exercise restraint if I were you, girl. There are security mechanoids everywhere, so don't throw away your life so quickly after someone gave you a second chance.	2																					
45	45		301								Yoyo	You know Hanying?	1																					
46	46		301									Jin Man does not answer, only turning away with a "hmph" before telling his men to move the wares he just bought.																						
47	47		204							1	14																							
48	48		301								Yoyo	Oh, no! If I don't hurry, I'll be home late tonight!	1																					
49	49		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Aggrieved as she is, Yoyo does not have time to barter with Jin Man. She dives right back into the crowded street, her small figure pushing forward away from the haggles and shouts.

56	56		301									Yoyo returns to her home exhausted. The market on the Nighter today was a little too bustling for her. She would have gone home sooner if not for Jin Man.

58	58		301							1	Uno	Rargh—	1																					
59	59		301									The Blubber Uno wobbles its way toward Yoyo upon seeing her, handing her a pair of couplets in its hands.

61	61		301							1	Yoyo	Whoa! Did you write this, Uno? It's so pretty... Did Hanying teach you? It's so good that we can sell it when the monthly market opens again on the ship!	1																					
62	62		301									Hearing Yoyo's compliment, Uno sways from side to side, looking delighted.

65	65		301							1	Hanying	You're back, Yoyo. You're a little late today. Is everything alright?	2																					
66	66		301									Hanying steps inside the room upon hearing Yoyo's voice, looking worried.																						
67	67		204							1	2																							
68	68		301								Yoyo	I'm sorry, Hanying... I couldn't get everything you wanted.	1																					
69	69		301									Hanying pats Yoyo on the head, taking the goods Yoyo bought and putting them aside.																						
70	70		204							2																								
71	71		301								Hanying	That's okay. They're just... for you later...	2																					
72	72		301									Yoyo is not sure what Hanying means, but she is certain Hanying is looking out for her.																						
73	73		204							1																								
74	74		301								Yoyo	You're all dressed up, Hanying! Are you heading out to work? Is there a show at the theater tonight?!	1																					
75	75		301									Yoyo's eyes glisten as she looks forward to a day when she can perform at the theater like Hanying, earning her keep on the Nighter without relying on someone else.																						
76	76		204							1	2																							
77	77		301								Yoyo	Can you take me with you, Hanying? I've remembered all the steps you taught me. Maybe I can get a role as a side character or something...	1																					
78	78		301									Hanying cannot help but smile, seeing the way Yoyo looks.																						
79	79		301								Hanying	The way you move is more like doing martial arts and acrobatics than dancing...	2																					
80	80		204							1	14																							
81	81		301								Yoyo	Ugh... I just can't do the elegant dances. After all, my dad taught me martial arts since I was young.	1																					
82	82		301								Hanying	I'm just teasing you. Many in the troupe speak highly of you, you know?	2																					
83	83		204							1	2																							
84	84		301								Yoyo	Seriously?! Then...	1																					
85	85		301								Hanying	...Still no. I've made arrangements. The next time the Nighter is close to Kowloong, you can leave the ship secretly and go home.	2																					
86	86		301								Yoyo	R-really?!	1																					
87	87		301									Yoyo cannot believe that she may actually leave this place and return to her parents.																						
88	88		204							2	4																							
89	89		301								Hanying	Yes... so you should stop going somewhere crowded like the theater, and I'll take care of trading wares from now on. We don't want anyone to recognize you when you leave. Who knows how many years we'll wait if we miss this chance?	2																					
90	90		301									Yoyo nods obediently. But the unexpected good news has her disoriented.																						
91	91		301								Yoyo	Oh, okay. But at least let me help you with your makeup!	1																					
92	92		301									Hanying smiles, sitting down before the dressing table. Yoyo carefully observes Hanying's overwhelmingly beautiful face with the light's help.																						
93	93		301								Yoyo	You still look so pretty no matter how many times I've seen you...	1																					
94	94		204							2																								
95	95		301								Hanying	Is that so...? I have no clear notions of "beauty" as a mechanoid, but I'm sure you'll be much prettier than me when you grow up, Yoyo.	2																					
96	96		301									Yoyo's hand with the powder puff gently glides over Hanying's cheeks, leaving behind a light flush—Yoyo has been doing Hanying's makeup for a while in case her identity as a mechanoid is exposed during a performance.																						
97	97		204							1	14																							
98	98		301								Yoyo	But I've grown so much already, even now... Will Mom and Dad recognize me when I go back to Kowloong?	1																					
99	99		301								Hanying	I can't say for sure... but you don't look much different from before to me.	2																					
100	100		204							1	2																							
101	101		301								Yoyo	You're the one who doesn't look different! You're still so pretty after all this time.	1																					
102	102		301									Yoyo attentively applies eyeliner on Hanying, not noticing the sadness in Hanying's eyes.																						
103	103		204							2	4																							
104	104		301								Hanying	You're right... A human's thoughts and emotions would grow and develop over time, but a mechanoid can never easily "let go" or "change" its values...	2																					
105	105		204							1																								
106	106		301								Yoyo	Is that how it is for you as well, Hanying?	1																					
107	107		301								Hanying	It is... But I've heard of a mechanoid called "Sagemachina" living with its disciples on land. They have "hearts" that are beyond their programming even though they are mechanoids... If I can find them, maybe I...	2																					
108	108		204							1	2																							
109	109		301								Yoyo	Then you should go back to Kowloong with me, Hanying! We'll find my parents and then look for this "Sagemachina" together!	1																					
110	110		301									Hanying smiles. She knows that Yoyo's fantasy is almost impossible, but she cannot help but imagine their journey together on land.																						
111	111		204							2																								
112	112		301								Hanying	But that's just a myth. Who knows how many years and decades it'll take us to find them...	2																					
113	113		301								Yoyo	Oh... Forget if Mom and Dad would still recognize me—I'm sure I'll be an old granny by then... Alright, almost done!	1																					
114	114		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Yoyo takes out a brush, dipping it in vermillion pigment and painting Hanying's lips—those lips tremble for a while before finally speaking.																						
115	115		204							2	5																							
116	116		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Hanying	Yoyo, you can stay how you look right now when you search for your parents, no matter how many years have passed... if you become a Construct.	2																					
117	117		301								Yoyo	A Construct...? Can I become a Construct?	1																					
118	118		301									Yoyo has seen those Constructs on the market before. They are called the "Kowloong Crew", a remarkable group of humans that have become machines, working as the left and right hands of Lady Qu.																						
119	119		204							2	2																							
120	120		301								Hanying	You can! Actually, I've saved up enough to afford a procedure on you. I've also prepared all the parts you'd need, so you don't have to worry...	2																					
121	121		204							1																								
122	122		301								Yoyo	Okay, but...	1																					
123	123		301									Yoyo finds Hanying a little strange when talking about this topic as if Hanying is withholding something.																						
124	124		301								Hanying	Yoyo, you don't have to decide now...	2																					
125	125		301									Hanying, having completed her makeup, stands up and quickly heads for the foyer with her back toward Yoyo. Yet she waits for a long while before speaking again.																						
126	126		204							2	5																							
127	127		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Hanying	But I hope you can... consider it.	2

132	132		201							1	500442	5																						
133	133		301							1	Hanying	I shouldn't have talked to the girl about becoming a Construct... She should return to her parents.	1

138	138		301									Realizing that, Hanying smiles, quickly regaining her usual composure.																						
139	139		204							1	2																							
140	140		301								Hanying	My apologies... I was lost in thought.	1																					
141	141		301								Troupe Leader	As long as you're alright... I thought one of your crazy fans did something to bother you again.	2																					
142	142		301									The troupe leader leans toward Hanying and whispers in her ears.																						
143	143		301								Troupe Leader	That rich fella Jin Man is back... and he's asking for you.	2																					
144	144		301								Hanying	I see. Please tell him... I'll find him after the performance.	1																					
145	145		301								Troupe Leader	Sure... By the way, why isn't your sister with you? The girl has a solid foundation, and we happened to need someone to perform sword dances...	2																					
146	146		204							1	5																							
147	147		301								Hanying	I'm sorry... but she won't be...	1																					
148	148		401							2	212																							
149	149		301									The troupe leader is about to ask Hanying something when the audience cheers loudly, only stopping after a loud "Bang!" from the gongs—they are waiting for the new performance on the stage.																						
150	150		301								Troupe Leader	Alright, alright! Time to go to work, guys. Get ready!	2																					
151	151		301									The troupe leader shouts, and dancers wearing the same dresses as Hanying's gather together, doing their final preparations before stepping on stage.

158	158		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						On the most extravagant stage of the Nighter, the dancers appear amid thunderous applause. Hanying, the fairest and the most talented dancer of them all, enters to the loudest cheers.																						
159	159		201							1	500462																							
160	160		301							1	Audience	"Falling snow by the Luo River; morning clouds in the Wu Mountains. The glamor that can move cities; the beauty that once broke kingdoms..." That's Lady Hanying right there. She's worth all the money I've saved up!	1																					
161	161		301									He notices an unfamiliar man sitting nearby with a bamboo hat on, even during the dance, which he finds odd.

168	168		301								Audience	What? Didn't you know? She's the most famous performer in recent years! I can give you a whole lecture on her...	1																					
169	169		301									"Cradle" ignores the self-indulgent audience member next to him, nodding at someone standing at the side before taking a small device from his pocket and wearing it on his ear.																						
170	170		301									Whispering a series of nonsensical phrases, "Cradle" combines his words into a signal that reaches the stage through the crowd.

174	174		301									A pain Hanying never-before-felt hits her right inside her mind, causing her to lose balance mid-dance. But she manages to take advantage of the force of the drop, turning the fall into an impressive somersault.																						
175	175		301								Hanying	(What is this... My code signature is receiving external interference?)	1																					
176	176		301									This unexpected showcase triggers roaring applause from the audience, where several menacing figures hide among them, smirking.
