3	3		301			DialogEnable						Before anyone can make a move, the Corrupted roars and turns toward the Constructs on the way, rushing toward Wanshi at the back.																						
4	4		301									Watching it getting closer, Wanshi keeps pulling the trigger. The explosive shells hit the opponent's legs accurately but fail to stop the Corrupted from moving.

9	9		301									Though Wanshi has failed to stop the Corrupted from moving, he has managed to damage its frame. He focuses on its busted joint on the left leg and quickly rolls to the left, dodging its charge.																						
10	1000		401							2	1503																							
11	10		301									Though he is not directly hit, the rubble splashed around by the Corrupted crashing into the building hits him hard, knocking him to the ground.

16	14		301									The Corrupted slowly makes it out of the debris and turns to look at the human and Constructs fallen to the ground. It walks toward the nearby Wanshi, ready to give all its targets a final blow.																						
17	1002		401							2	10007502																							
18	15		301									The moment its arms are raised high, several explosive shells hit the Corrupted, blowing half of its torso out of sight.

23	20		301									Wanshi looks back and realizes that Thompson and several Constructs have helped each other up, initiating the last attack while leaning on the shelter.																						
24	21		301									The recoil of the rifle knocks them to the ground. Old and new wounds split apart as vital fluid oozes out.

35	32		301									Their last attack has not destroyed the memory shell of the Corrupted. With petrol dripping from the remaining half of its torso, it flings its weapon and strikes toward Wanshi's head.

37	35		301							1	Wanshi	Seems like... this is where I end.	1

42	40		301									A deafening roar comes from afar. Wanshi opens his eyes out of instinct to search for the source of the sound.																						
43	41		301									Wanshi sees the dark greatsword of Kamui before him as the Corrupted is kicked aside with its memory shell broken into pieces.																						
44	42		301									At this moment, the last straw that held Wanshi together was no longer there. He dropped to the ground hard and fell into a coma.

55	52		301								Kamui	Relax. It's over.	2																					
56	53		301								Kamui	All Corrupted in this area has been cleared. Thompson and the others are taking care of the wounded.	2

62	58		301								Wanshi	Just do it without considering the consequences and whether it's true or false.	1

72	66		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Thompson walks into the shelter where Wanshi is in and asks Kamui. Kamui looks down at Wanshi, only to find that he has closed his eyes again, his chest rising and falling at a steady rhythm.																						
73	67		301								Wanshi	...																						
74	68		301								Kamui	He was awake but he fell asleep again. Shh, don't wake him up!																						
75	69		301								Wanshi	You're the loudest here, idiot.																						
76	70		301								Kamui	Well...																						
77	71		301								Thompson	Haha, it's a good thing that he sleeps. At least it's better than insomnia.																						
78	72		301								Thompson	Having figured it out, I guess he can sleep sounder and longer now.

82	900		301									I'm well aware that the sins of the past cannot be undone.																						
83	76		301									But now, I will have to move forward carrying the burden of those lies and the past.																						
84	901		301									I am not doing this to prove that those lies are real, or right, or wrong. I am doing this to protect those around me from being hurt by them.																						
85	77		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					It is time for you and me, as well as the Star of Life, to move forward and make some changes.
