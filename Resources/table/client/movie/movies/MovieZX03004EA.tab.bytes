5	5		301									Even more worrying are the numerous cracks on the tempered glass that separates the water.

11	11		301							1	Member A	We still haven't completed our objectives on the lower third floor and in the west wing. If this is too dangerous for you, you can head for the west wing first. It's disconnected from here, so it shouldn't be affected.	1																					
12	12		301								Member A	We Constructs don't need to worry about drowning, and our comms will still work underwater. We can carry on our mission.	1																					
13	13		302								No.	14																						
14	14		301								Member A	Why?	1																					
15	15		301									You quickly explain before more of them object.																						
16	16		301									"You haven't equipped the enhanced modules for underwater combat. Fighting in the water will put you at a great disadvantage."																						
17	17		301									"It is too risky to fight hamstrung if we don't know exactly who and what we are fighting."																						
18	18		201							1	500533	8																						
19	19		301							1		The Purifying Force members do not agree or disagree with you. Instead, they all turn to look at Bianca.																						
20	20		204							1																								
21	21		301								Bianca	Deploy a drone to the lower third floor. We're retreating afterward.	1																					
22	22		202							1					1																			
23	23		301									One of the members takes out a beetle-shaped drone and sets up a route on the terminal. The drone spreads its wings and flies toward the lower third floor.																						
24	24		201							1	500405																							
25	25		301							1	Member B	Just so you know, these drones are designed to track deserters. I have no idea how long it'll last at a place with a high Punishing Virus concentration.	1																					
26	26		301								Member B	It could send back the intel we need, or it could be infected before it could deliver anything important.	1																					
27	27		301								Member B	There's no way of knowing. We're leaving it to chance...	1																					
28	28		301									"Crack..."																						
29	29		301									You all hear a sharp splinter and immediately look for its source...																						
30	30		301								Member B	And chance has not been on our side.	1																					
31	31		202							1					1																			
32	32		301									As if on cue, you begin to hear the sound of successive crackling and snapping around you. Years of weathering and the impact from the fight just now have finally broken the tempered glass that keeps the water away.

42	42		301								Broadcast	All guests, please follow the instructions of our staff and leave in an orderly manner.																						
43	43		301								Broadcast	Warning. Drainage groups D2-A to D2-K are offline. Corresponding staff, please troubleshoot the system immediately.																						
44	44		301									A large amount of seawater gushes into the dolphin show hall, raising the water level drastically. It quickly reaches your knees, slowing you down significantly.

48	48		301									The gate to the exit is lowering at a moderate but steady pace. Given how thick it appears, you fear that none of your weapons can open it once it is fully shut.																						
49	49		301									Even then, all the Purifying Force members turn to look at you, surprised.																						
50	50		202							1					1																			
51	51		302								...	52																						
52	52		201							1	500533																							
53	53		301							1	Bianca	Someone must have tempered with the system here.	1																					
54	54		301									That is when all of you receive a video on your terminals. You glance at it as you run...																						
55	55		301									...And the Red Tide that has filled the entire space underneath you almost makes you stop.																						
56	56		201							1	500405																							
57	57		301							1	Member B	Chance is on our side, after all.	1																					
58	58		301									The member that has been at the back says calmly.																						
59	59		301								Member B	We've managed to dodge a few Hetero-Creatures and capture this before the drone completely fails.	1																					
60	60		301									That member has not looked up this whole time, operating the drone and recording.																						
61	61		302								(Upload footage to the command center)	62																						
62	62		301								Member B	But I guess chance can only take us this far.	1

65	65		301									The gate is nearly closed. You have overclocked your exoskeleton to match the Constructs' speed, but you are all still a long way from the exit.																						
66	66		301									And there is never just one bad thing that is happening.

70	70		301								Loud Noise	Enemies incoming!																						
71	71		301								Lucia	What? Now?!	1																					
72	72		302								Lucia, get the refugees and the Purifying Force out of here first.	73																						
73	73		302								Come back with the heavy-duty grinder from the transport craft afterward.	74																						
74	74		301								Lucia	The heavy-duty grinder? Commandant, has your location been...	1																					
75	75		301								Lucia	I understand. I will make sure everyone gets out safely. Wait for me.	1																					
76	76		301									You nod, looking down at the water that has reached your waist.																						
77	77		202							1					1																			
78	78		510							2	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory619.jpg																							
79	79		301									After accepting that there is no exiting before the gate closes shut, all of you begin to slow down, and you start calculating how long the small portable oxygen tank you carry will last you.																						
80	80		201							1	500394																							
81	81		301							1	Member A	Catch.	1																					
82	82		301									The Construct who suggested continuing the mission tosses you a can.																						
83	83		302								(Catch)	84																						
84	84		302								An oxygen tank?	85																						
85	85		301									It is an oxygen tank adorned with children's drawings done with oil markers. The shell is a little rusty, but the equipment itself seems well maintained, even though it looks nothing like what Babylonia gives you.																						
86	86		301								Member A	I kept it from my days as a Scavenger. Use this after your oxygen tank runs out, but don't forget to return it afterward.	1																					
87	87		301									The Construct does not explain too much.																						
88	88		302								Thanks.	89																						
89	89		301									The Construct does not reply, standing to the side instead. All that is left is the sound of rushing water and the turning gears within the gate.

92	92		301							1	Member C	This is so loud... Huh? Is the gate slowing down?	2																					
93	93		301									Hearing that, you all turn and look.																						
94	94		202							1	2				1																			
95	95		301									The heavy gate was approaching the water unrelentingly, but its signal light has just changed and is now blinking red.																						
96	96		301									Following a blaring alarm, the gate stops.																						
97	97		301									Right as you wonder if this is another trap laid by the enemy, you hear a frail voice from the broadcast.																						
98	98		301								Grace	Greetings, Babylonians. My name is Grace. My team and I have stopped the gate from closing.																						
99	99		301								Grace	We are currently trapped inside the control room on the lower second level. Most of us are too weak to walk. We desperately need your help.																						
100	100		201							1	500533	7																						
101	101		301							1	Bianca	Grace?	1																					
102	102		301									Although Grace is one of the targets of the investigation, Bianca thought Grace must have been taken by the Red Tide after what she has been through.																						
103	103		301									But if Grace is alive, then...																						
104	104		301								Bianca	Is Chiko with you?	1																					
105	105		301								Grace	...I'm sorry. She was standing between the Ascendant and us with her team... All we could do was run...																						
106	106		204							1	8																							
107	107		301								Bianca	...	1																					
108	108		301								Grace	Our escape route was filled with those monsters, so we've been hiding in the control room... We've run out of food these last few days.																						
109	109		301								Grace	Please save us... Save the children, at least...																						
110	110		204							1																								
111	111		301								Bianca	We'll be there immediately. Please hold on.	1																					
112	112		301								Grace	Thank you... thanks...

117	117		301									The Construct who has opposed Bianca's every decision sneers faintly before pulling up the map to the control room and starting to walk.																						
118	118		301								Bianca	I thought you would oppose it.	1																					
119	119		301								Member A	The Vice-Captain would have done the same. She wouldn't have done it out of sympathy like you, though.	2

122	122		301								Member A	That woman recognized us before we presented ourselves, which means she must have seen us through the cameras.	2																					
123	123		301								Member A	She's only speaking up now because she wants us to eliminate those monsters.	2																					
124	124		301								Member A	I don't believe that they have children with them for a second. If we rejected them, however, they would have just threatened us with closing the gate.	2																					
125	125		301								Member A	They're making a move now, probably because they realized that we have a human who can't breathe underwater with us.	2
