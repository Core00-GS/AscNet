15	15		301								Lee	Can't let an Ascendant get ahold of it again.	1																					
16	16		301								Lamia	...Ascendant? Pfft, you really are pretty clueless, aren't you?	2																					
17	17		301								Lee	What are you saying?	1																					
18	18		301								Lamia	Hmm... I'll get nagged if I say another word. You're nowhere nearly as scary as that guy.	2																					
19	19		301								Lamia	Try as you may, I'll get what I want eventually. And this time... you're not catching me.	2

27	27		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Lamia was going to seize Huaxu's key from the exhausted Babylonia members, but the explosion and collapse of the facility have brought unexpected changes to Lamia's plan.																						
28	28		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Lamia managed to get the thing that "he" wanted, but she finds that if she doesn't run, she will be buried alive with the entire facility.

42	42		301									A steel bar loses its hinge and swings down.																						
43	43		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Lamia is in mid-air and has nowhere to run. She is knocked sideways, slamming into the ruins on the opposite site.																						
44	44		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory278.png																								
45	45		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The impact pushes Lamia all the way to the other side of the ruins. Meanwhile, right underneath her...																						
46	46		301									Roland sits at the bottom of a crater, watching the Red Tide pouring down from the broken pipes. Beside him lies the other ashen Hetero-Creature, now completely lifeless.																						
47	47		301									He picks up his broken left arm, trying to match it up with where it fractures from his shoulder, before putting it down disappointingly.																						
48	48		201							1	500165

51	51		301									This group of Ascendants, led by Luna, is facing inevitable destruction, Lamia believes.																						
52	52		301									But she refuses to go down with it.																						
53	53		301									She wants to survive. She will survive, no matter what she has to do...																						
54	54		201							1	500165																							
55	55		301							1	Lamia	Dammit... I won't die here... Eeaaagghhh!	1																					
56	56		202							1					1																			
57	57		301									She forces herself up, clinging onto every single protrusion of the ruins.																						
58	58		301									One step after another.																						
59	59		301									Every step means she is closer to "survival."																						
60	60		301									Every step means she is moving further away from "those people."																						
61	61		301									But Lamia has to do it. Because she must live on.																						
62	62		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She sees the sun outside—

70	70		301								Lamia	Remember the Polyphage? It was a complete mess...	1

73	73		301								Lamia	(Will he believe me? Will he?)	1																					
74	74		301								Roland	...Whatever. I was lucky to survive it. You couldn't really do anything even if you were there.	2

76	76		301								Lamia	(S-safe...)	1

90	90		301								Lamia	Eek?!	1																					
91	91		202							1					1																			
92	92		301									Two shells fly past Lamia's both sides, kicking up a lot of dust from the ground. She looks back at their source and finally gets a vision of the chaser—																						
93	93		301									It's a black figure rapidly approaching from the sky.																						
94	94		201							1	500326

113	113		301									Until I got near The Merciful One's camp... That black guy circled around and left. They might have some sort of agreement.																						
114	114		301								Roland	...	2																					
115	115		301								Lamia	After that... I just saw you come out of her tent...	1																					
116	116		301								Lamia	Speaking of which, Roland, you look a lot different now... What happened?	1																					
117	117		301								Roland	If you ask me... She saved me, probably.	2																					
118	118		301								Lamia	...Saved you?	1																					
119	119		301								Roland	I just bought myself a chance, taking advantage of her uninhibited and unpredictable nature.	2																					
120	120		301								Roland	Even so, I took a great risk trying to set up an agent. Gotta be more careful in the future.	2																					
121	121		301								Roland	Now there is a second chance, "we" must find Luna again.	2																					
122	122		301								Lamia	Sigh... But where shall we go...?	1																					
123	123		301								Roland	...That's a problem indeed.	2																					
124	124		301								Lamia	(Even Roland doesn't have a clue... Such a rare sight.)	1																					
125	125		301								Lamia	(But if that's the case...)	1																					
126	126		301								Lamia	Why don't we split up? That way, we will have a better chance...	1																					
127	127		301								Lamia	(As long as I can leave Roland for a moment, I can get away...)	1																					
128	128		301								Roland	Actually, no.	2																					
129	129		301								Lamia	Eek?	1																					
130	130		301								Roland	I am just as clueless as you are. We won't get anywhere if we split up.	2																					
131	131		301								Roland	Both of us are equally worn out. Better not divide our strength even further.	2																					
132	132		301								Roland	Or...	2																					
133	133		301									Before Roland says "are you planning to run away," Lamia quickly replies.																						
134	134		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lamia	L-let's move together then!	1

137	137		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Lamia doesn't mind if Roland doubts her, as long as he doesn't become an enemy.																						
138	138		301									If she is lucky, she may find enough chips for her next deal with Murray along the way.																						
139	139		301								Lamia	Guess we just have to move together for now.																						
140	140		301									Instead of thinking where to go, Lamia would rather let those around her decide her direction.																						
141	141		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She can then focus on how to survive. This is what she has always been doing, so the decision isn't hard to make.

146	146		301								Roland	We might have lost the others, but I don't see any harm in two left-behinds sticking together.	2																					
147	147		301									So Roland isn't eager to dig into Lamia's hesitating and capricious response.																						
148	148		301									It's not the time to push her away yet. After all, she makes a great scapegoat, and is an asset he can sacrifice any time.																						
149	149		301								Roland	Speaking of which, how much do you know about The Merciful One? Why were you with her?	2																					
150	150		301								Lamia	Eek?	1																					
151	151		301								Lamia	I don't know either...	1																					
152	152		301								Lamia	It's just that... I sensed a power from her, not quite like Miss Luna's... But very similar...	1																					
153	153		301								Lamia	So...																						
154	154		301								Roland	You wanted to find a shelter, but she turned you down?	2																					
155	155		301									Lamia nods.																						
156	156		301									Ever after what happened to Shome, Roland had been investigating The Merciful One. But every piece of information about her was ambiguous, just like her mysterious smile and unpredictable action.																						
157	157		301									She seems to be always alone, with no minions or friends. Roland cannot tell if she poses a threat to Luna as an agent.																						
158	158		301									Not to mention that she did save his life.																						
159	159		301									She gave him so much, but asked for nothing. Even when she learned that he was only using her, she wasn't upset at all. Whoever did this must be either a saint or a fool.																						
160	160		301									Roland does not think she is a fool, but can hardly call her a saint.																						
161	161		301									What is her purpose then?																						
162	162		301								Roland	Either way, it's not something I should worry about right now.	2																					
163	163		301									Perhaps she had a purpose, perhaps she didn't. But that's not important at this moment.																						
164	164		301									After all, he would have died long ago without her.																						
165	165		301								Roland	Let's take a rest and head out at daybreak.	2																					
166	166		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lamia	Um...	1

177	177		301								Lamia	...Eek—?	1																					
178	178		301									Lamia wants to complain, but Roland has already lain back against the wall and entered hibernate mode.
