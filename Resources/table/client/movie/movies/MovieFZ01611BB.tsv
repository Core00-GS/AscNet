3	3		301									It takes them a while to finally find a strong enough building.																						
4	4		301									Just when they have finished settling in for the night, a group of armed young scavengers appears.

6	6		301							1	Armed Hoodlum	Who gave you the okay to stay here?	1

17	17		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The hoodlums wake up to the sunlight seeping through the hotel's cracked glasses.																						
18	18		301									Crying foul over the injustice, the scavengers crouch in the corner with bruises all over.																						
19	19		201							1	500136																							
20	20		301							1	Armed Hoodlum	Let's send them to the commercial area today to see if they can find anything useful there...	1																					
21	21		301									He rubs his eyes as he says to the rest of his group.																						
22	22		202							1					1																			
23	23		301								Minion	All of you, stand up!																						
24	24		301									He swings an iron pipe as he shouts his order to the scavengers trembling by the wall.																						
25	25		201							1	500260																							
26	26		301							1	Scavenger E	God will not forgive you!	1																					
27	27		301									The girl's serious remark, however, is met with an outburst of laughter from the hoodlums.																						
28	28		201							1	500136																							
29	29		301							1	Armed Hoodlum	You can pray all you want.	1																					
30	30		201							1	500260																							
31	31		301							1	Scavenger E	I'm sure God is out there! My dad and mom always told me that God is out there!	1																					
32	32		301								Scavenger E	I've seen an angel myself! It was that very angel from God who told me about there being supplies here!	1																					
33	33		301								Scavenger E	Aah!	1																					
34	34		301									The girl covers her mouth with her hands because she realizes she just said something she should not have. The young hoodlums, however, simply shrug it off as nonsense.																						
35	35		201							1	500136																							
36	36		301							1	Armed Hoodlum	Oh? Well, did God come to save your parents?	1																					
37	37		301									The upset young girl takes a step back, again causing an outburst of laughter from the hoodlums.																						
38	38		301								Armed Hoodlum	Enough chit-chat. Get them to work now. If they try anything funnyâ€”	1																					
39	39		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					He does the cutthroat gesture with his thumb. With iron pipes in their hands, the other hoodlums start ushering the feeble scavengers out of the building.																						
40	40		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory7.jpg																								
41	41		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Not until it has turned dark that the scavengers trudge back to the abandoned hotel.																						
42	42		201							1	500136																							
43	43		301							1	Armed Hoodlum	What's the result?	1																					
44	44		301									He examines the items the scavengers have brought back and finds most of them useless.																						
45	45		202							1					1																			
46	46		301									All except for one brand new supply bag, which stands out like a piece of cheese sitting on a mousetrap.																						
47	47		301									Unbothered, he picks up the bag, takes out a can and some hardtacks and distributes them to his group.																						
48	48		201							1	500136																							
49	49		301							1	Armed Hoodlum	Store the rest of it.	1

53	53		301								Armed Hoodlum	Huh? What made you think you'd get anything when this is all the lot of you came back with?	1																					
54	54		301								Armed Hoodlum	Want to have a taste of my rage for a change?	1																					
55	55		201							2	500270		400

59	59		301							1	Scavenger D	He's crazy. Just ignore him...	2																					
60	60		301								Armed Hoodlum	Crazy, uh? Let's see if we can fix him. Won't do us no good keeping a madman around.	1

63	63		301							1	Scavenger E	What are you trying to do?	1

76	76		201							2	500140		400																					
77	77		301							1	Scavenger A	I couldn't catch any sleep. I kept hearing waves splashing right behind the building.	1																					
78	78		301								Scavenger C	So did I.	2																					
79	79		301									Right in the middle of their discussion about the mysterious waves last night, one of the hoodlums comes in.																						
80	80		202							1	2				1																			
81	81		301								Minion	Where's the crazy dude?																						
82	82		201							1	500260

84	84		202							1					1																			
85	85		301								Minion	We only tried to fix him a little.																						
86	86		301									He looks at them without a trace of remorse, as if trying to tell them that they really only tried to "fix" him.																						
87	87		301									They look around. The man, who was crouching in the corner before, is nowhere to be found now.																						
88	88		201							1	500260																							
89	89		301							1	Youle	He didn't come back.	1																					
90	90		202							1					1																			
91	91		301								Minion	Tsk. Then look for him when you're out looking for supplies later. Not that I care if he's found anyways.																						
92	92		301									After scratching his filthy hair, he raises a pipe and starts ushering them out of the room.																						
93	93		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Minion	Hurry up and get to work!																						
94	94		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory7.jpg																								
95	95		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						It is now dark, yet the man is still nowhere to be found.																						
96	96		301									The scavengers come back again with nothing useful, except for another brand new supply bag.																						
97	97		301									Having gotten nothing again, they go back to their corner, talking while trying to keep one another warm.																						
98	98		201							1	500268																							
99	99		301							1	Scavenger A	Cough, cough... My infection is getting worse.	1

101	101		201							2	500226		400																					
102	102		301							1	Scavenger D	Where did he go exactly?	2																					
103	103		301								Scavenger C	I wonder if we're going to hear the waves again tonight? I want to go and have a look...	1																					
104	104		301									They seem to be having a conversation, but everyone is really just trying to vent, paying no attention to anyone else.																						
105	105		301								Scavenger D	Should we just leave this place, then?	2																					
106	106		301									He casts his eyes over the others as he raises the question. There is no way they can make it back in their current conditions.																						
107	107		301									No one even knows what the supply hunt tomorrow will be like.																						
108	108		202							1	2				1																			
109	109		201							1	500260																							
110	110		301							1	Youle	I'm sure we'll come back with plenty of supplies tomorrow. If we do, we'll all finally be able to eat.	1																					
111	111		301									The girl is feeling no better than anyone else, but she sounds as if she knows for certain what is going to happen the next day.																						
112	112		301								Youle	God will grant us happiness.	1																					
113	113		301									With a helpless smile on his face, the man sitting before the girl pats her head with his wrinkled hand, thinking that she is talking out of her imagination.																						
114	114		201							1	500226																							
115	115		301							1	Scavenger D	Yes, for sure... Let's call it a night for now.	1

141	141		301								Scavenger A	I had a hard time falling asleep again last night. I went out to check on things when I heard the waves, and...	1																					
142	142		301								Scavenger A	The path just out the back entrance, it... It was all red.	1
