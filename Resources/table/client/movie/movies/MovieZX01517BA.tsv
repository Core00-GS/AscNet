14	11		301								HNB1	Oh, and just call me HNB1—just like how HBG3 calls me.	2																					
15	13		301								Little Girl	That's not a name. It's just a number. Don't you two have any other names you call each other?	1																					
16	15		301								HNB1	You mean B1 or G3? That's a name we call different Tai'E series with. Sometimes our bosses call us by nicknames to tell us apart. But that new hunk of steel doesn't like calling me that.	2																					
17	17		301								Little Girl	Are you friends?	1																					
18	19		301								HNB1	Well, that's a pretty tough question. I don't know if we count as friends. We're just partners—not sure if he likes me that much though, but I guess it's weird for a robot to have likes and dislikes. We just obey orders.	2																					
19	21		301								Little Girl	But I think he actually cares about you...	1																					
20	23		301								HNB1	Really? Did he send you over here? I thought there's just nothing but data in that brain of his...	2																					
21	24		301								HNB1	And why are you suddenly acting like a life coach? Aren't you only eight or nine years old?	2

34	36		301									The top priority for Tai'E units is to ensure human safety.																						
35	37		301									He has always had a special affinity toward humans. Whether it be imitating humans on TV or doing silly things to provoke laughter...																						
36	3010		301									He never understood why he did so. He just knew it would make others look happy—that people would surround him and focus on him.																						
37	38		301									He never understood why this behavior makes humans happy.																						
38	39		301									But now... For the first time, he seems to be feeling an emotion that is exclusive to humans.

48	49		301									Seeing one of his own turn into a bloodthirsty monster... Seeing what the humans—the ones who trusted and relied on him—did. He suddenly feels... afraid.																						
49	50		301									Afraid to point of wanting to run away.																						
50	51		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Is this feeling a preset command, or a system error? He could not tell.

60	61		301									The thought of telling her that his series of Tai'E units do not have pain receptors crosses his mind, but it came out as an exaggerated yelp of pain.																						
61	62		301									He meant to make her laugh. But instead, she takes off one of her ribbons and carefully wraps it around the damaged part.
