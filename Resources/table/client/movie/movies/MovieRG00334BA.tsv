3	3		301			DialogEnable						When we finally got to the altar, Liv was kneeling on the ground, exhausted. The King picked up the complete artifact next to her.

5	5		301							1	King	Oh, you still have the strength to make it here. Too bad...	1

10	10		301									The artifact was glowing like a rainbow in the King's hand. Just like the name "Goddess" suggested, it emitted a warm, calming power.

13	13		301							1	Vera	Now that you've got what you want, don't forget our victory. You know what to do.	2																					
14	14		301								King	Of course. Let me turn into my complete form and grant you victory with the power of the system. Thank you for helping me, heroes!	1																					
15	15		301									After Vera's reminder, the artifact emitted a blazing light. The King's human body slowly collapsed, with new limbs sticking out.																						
16	16		301								King	Ahhhh, this is it... The power of the artifact. I can feel power flowing into myself!	1

18	18		301									After some trembling, he turned into a giant mechanoid that looked nothing like a human.																						
19	19		301									It was ball-shaped and equipped with external modules that could launch mini-robots and missiles. The giant observation device in the center of its body was blinking a mysterious red light.																						
20	20		301									But more importantly, the system menu showed that the King finally had an HP bar.																						
21	21		201							1	500016																							
22	22		301							1	King	Behold, my true, invincible body! This is my power!	1																					
23	23		302								That's just a Riot, isn't it?	24	Does he have an HP bar now?	32																				
24	24		201							1	500173																							
25	25		301							1	Lee	Yeah, it's a Riot.	1																					
26	26		201							1	500016																							
27	27		301							1	King	Hah, I'm no regular Riot. Call me King Riot!	1																					
28	28		201							1	500173																							
29	29		301							1	Lee	...Isn't that more stupid?	1

32	32		201							1	1081001	1																						
33	33		301							1	Kamui	You're right, Commandant. Usually, when Boss turns into this state, we can start attacking.	1

35	35		301							1	Lucia	Let's do it then.	1																					
36	36		201							1	500016																							
37	37		301							1	King	How arrogant! Don't you dare look down on me, heroes!	1

40	40		301			PanelActor1Shake				1	King	Ugh, what!?	1																					
41	41		301									The King was going to do something with the artifact, but he suddenly received a heavy blow.																						
42	42		201							1	500180	5																						
43	43		301							1	Karenina	Too noisy! Control your volume, you big fat machine!	1																					
44	44		301									It was a shot from Karenina's cannon. No longer shackled, she was standing in front of Liv to protect her.																						
45	45		201							1	500016																							
46	46		301							1	King	What's going on? I thought Vera had you!	1																					
47	47		201							1	500181	1

51	51		301			PanelActor1Shake				1	King	Urgh!!!	1																					
52	52		301									The King took another hit on the top. The artifact fell off his "head", and was quickly picked up by Camu.																						
53	53		301								King	What is this... What are you doing?!	1																					
54	54		201							1	500166	5

60	60		301							1	Lucia	Yeah. We will need her for the final battle.	1																					
61	61		201							1	500181	1																						
62	62		301							1	Vera	Can't you see? The question is so unnecessary.	1																					
63	63		201							1	500176	1																						
64	64		301							1	Camu	I know this is only a game, but I just hate to follow other people's orders. Especially when the person thinks he can control everything like Kurono.	1																					
65	65		201							1	500181	1																						
66	66		301							1	Vera	I don't hate you in person, but I prefer to ditch the stupid Boss.	1																					
67	67		201							1	500016																							
68	68		301							1	King	What the heck are you talking about!?	1																					
69	69		201							1	500180																							
70	70		301							1	Karenina	What a fool... Vera and Camu had been bluffing you all the time.	1																					
71	71		301								Karenina	Both them and us have only been waiting for you to have a proper HP bar.	1																					
72	72		201							1	500016
