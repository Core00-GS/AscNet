45	45		301								Chrome	That's not enough.	2

51	51		301								Construct Captain	Sigh... He wasn't always like this. He used to be quite easygoing with all his dirty jokes. But the squad he was in was completely wiped out in a scout mission.	1																					
52	52		301								Construct Captain	When the Rescue Force arrived, he was about to jump into the Red Tide. Took them a lot of effort to keep him from diving in, but still, he changed after that.	1																					
53	53		301								Construct Captain	No one knew what happened during that mission. It wasn't until his maintenance was over that he found out the commandant from his original squad was promoted and transferred to another team.	1																					
54	54		301									Chrome finds his chest aching as the Construct Captain explains.																						
55	55		301								Chrome	...Abandoned, is it?	2																					
56	56		301								Construct Captain	Probably thought he wasn't useful anymore.	1																					
57	57		301								Construct Captain	We're just tools to those humans, after all. Perhaps there's nothing strange for them to throw us away when they're done with us.	1																					
58	58		301								Construct Captain	We're fighting to reclaim Earth right now. I wonder how the humans will see us once our job is done and the war is over?	1																					
59	59		301								Chrome	Tools...	2																					
60	60		301								Construct Captain	It's not hard to understand, then... why he'd lose the will to live. Why he'd rather it all end back there.	1																					
61	61		301								Chrome	Does no one... want to change this?	2																					
62	62		301									The Construct Captain takes a look at the murmuring Chrome.																						
63	63		301								Construct Captain	Our squad was sent to cover the evacuation of a refugee camp under attack from the Corrupted on a past mission.	1																					
64	64		301								Construct Captain	Something went wrong with our planned route, and we went through an area filled with Corrupted.	1																					
65	65		301								Construct Captain	We tried our best to take the refugees to safety. We went through layers of Corrupted to save the kids in the camp.	1																					
66	66		301								Construct Captain	I had to carry the children back to the safe zone against a hailstorm of bullets. But when I put them down, one of them looked at me and cried.	1																					
67	67		301								Construct Captain	He cried, and he yelled, "It's a monster."	1																					
68	68		301								Construct Captain	I took a look at my reflection in the river, and that was when I found out that my whole body was scarred and burnt from the attack.	1																					
69	69		301								Construct Captain	Especially my face. Since the temperature of the shrapnel that hit it was too high, the artificial skin of half of my face had melted.	1																					
70	70		301								Construct Captain	...I suppose a human wouldn't even be able to stand.	1																					
71	71		301								Construct Captain	While I stood in front of the child, looking like I'd be joining the Corrupted at any moment.	1																					
72	72		301								Construct Captain	...Realizing that, my M.I.N.D. deviated drastically.	1																					
73	73		301								Construct Captain	Then I got sent here.	1																					
74	74		301								Construct Captain	A very talented doctor treated me then.	1																					
75	75		301								Construct Captain	Not only took my delirious complaints seriously, he patiently comforted me.	1																					
76	76		301								Construct Captain	For a moment, I felt like I was treated as a "human."	1																					
77	77		301								Construct Captain	It made me... less desperate.	1																					
78	78		301								Construct Captain	It made me think that perhaps humans and Constructs can understand each other.	1																					
79	79		301								Construct Captain	It should've been like that, shouldn't it?	1																					
80	80		301								Construct Captain	We were one and the same originally, weren't we?	1																					
81	81		301								Chrome	Humans will always fear the things they don't understand.	2																					
82	82		301								Chrome	They do that because they never understand what Constructs are.	2																					
83	83		301								Chrome	A single slander on Constructs can create panic among humans.	2																					
84	84		301								Chrome	How could I not notice that?	2																					
85	85		301								Construct Captain	What can we do, then?	1																					
86	86		301								Construct Captain	We are Constructs. We travel from the battlefield to the Maintenance Department and back. We accept missions, and then we complete them.	1																					
87	87		301								Construct Captain	The humans who survived, those sitting on their thrones comfortably in Babylonia, barely have the chance to know us.	1																					
88	88		301								Construct Captain	Who has the time to consider the relationship between humans and Constructs when we can barely survive and win this war against the Punishing Virus?	1																					
89	89		301									The Construct Captain pats the silent Chrome on his shoulder.
