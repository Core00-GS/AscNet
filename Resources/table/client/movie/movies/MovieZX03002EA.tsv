20	20		301									You smell a rotten scent different from the Red Tide through the tunnel. All of you cannot help but turn and stare at the fire alarm box covered in children's graffiti at the end of it.																						
21	21		301									Dried red-and-black matters cover the decorative illustrations like splashed ink. Dark red slime oozes out from underneath as if the rotten scent is made physical.

30	30		301									...And the thing inside "drips" onto the floor in consecutive globs, forming a cake of meat that is about two arms wide.																						
31	31		401							2	571																							
32	32		301									This is an ooze-like substance without a concrete form. Newly grown muscle tissues and lumps join together by splintered metal, and fresh organic matters submerge in slime.

37	37		301									"Wah..."																						
38	38		301									The organic matter rises and falls with its breath, and plump cysts bubble to its surface one after another. They quickly burst, splashing the foul substance within them onto the surrounding floor.

47	47		401							2	571																							
48	48		301									The ooze wriggles its lumps, struggling to crawl toward the spilled filth. The sharp, splintered metal cuts open its pink skin, and blood spills out, leaving a trail on the floor.

89	89		301									Norris' squad finally escaped the Ascendant's pursuit after a suicidal bombing. In return, everyone but Norris is now buried underneath the crumbled aquarium.																						
90	90		301									Norris only managed to escape because he was lucky enough to not be caught by the mechanical arm.																						
91	91		301								Norris	Comms is busted as well. I've gotta get out of here to inform the others.	1																					
92	92		301									Recalling the hellish scene on the lower third floor, even someone like Norris cannot help but shiver.																						
93	93		301								Norris	Dammit! I was supposed to be on the frontline! Why was a specialist like you rushing in?!	1
