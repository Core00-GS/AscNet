3	3		301									3:00 p.m. Outside the Training Room, Command Central																						
4	4		301									It is one of those rare days when Camu arrives at training on time. Babylonia is as sunny as usual, the artificial weather system making sure that the humidity and UV levels are perfect.																						
5	5		301									It gives Camu a sense of comfort.																						
6	6		301									He is heading towards the battle training room at the end of the corridor. The training has yet to begin, but he is already wondering what snacks he should get after it ends.																						
7	7		301									It is silly, of course, to prepare for something that has yet to happen. To Camu, disasters cannot be averted no matter how well-prepared you are.																						
8	8		301									Yet there is still a spring in his step as he walks. Quite a delightful feeling. Being silly might not be so bad if it lightens you up.																						
9	9		301				DialogDisable					He stops in front of the door with this unfamiliar emotion in mind. The sensor scans his iris and the door slides open.

13	13		301			DialogEnable						And then he hears the familiar voices speaking.																						
14	14		301								Asimov	...To conclude, you no longer have to complete these missions together from today on.																						
15	15		301									"So this request form..."																						
16	16		301									Standing there, back towards him, is the figure he has gradually become familiar with recently.																						
17	17		301								Asimov	Bring it to Hassen... or Nikola... or whoever you want. I don't care.																						
18	18		301								Asimov	There's nothing else I can do for you.																						
19	19		301									"Then sign here. After the text 'Agree to Terminate Missions'."

25	24		301			DialogEnable						Terminate mission?																						
26	25		301									Something lodges itself in Camu's throat. His previous good mood suddenly feels like no more than a joke. Replacing it is a crippling heaviness that resounds through his mechanical body.																						
27	26		301									The sunshine from outside the window casts mottled shadows on the wall, as if mocking him.																						
28	27		301				DialogDisable					Before he can even react, he hears a voice that is not his own speak up.

31	30		301			DialogEnable					???	Aren't you gonna hear what I have to say?																						
32	31		301									The two speakers in the room turn around to see Camu's surprised face.																						
33	32		301				DialogDisable				???	If you even care, I want you to know that I refuse to be transferred for any reason.

36	35		301			DialogEnable						Am I the one who's talking?																						
37	36		301									So it's my voice, huh?																						
38	37		301									Eh, who cares. I'm at rock bottom already. There's nothing I have to lose. That itself makes me free.																						
39	38		301				DialogDisable					With this thought in mind, I walk on, even though my M.I.N.D. is utterly empty. Someone, tell me what to do‚ÄîI'll even take Kamui. In the midst of all the chaos, I hear myself speak in a voice that's clearly not mine...

44	43		302								...Camu??	44																						
45	44		301								Camu	You people brought me here. You people assigned me to „Äêkuroname„Äë. I don't want any explanations or any excuses.	1																					
46	45		301								Camu	If you want to transfer me somewhere else simply because you believe I'd be a better fit elsewhere, I refuse. I will not allow anyone who's not „Äêkuroname„Äë to touch my M.I.N.D.	1																					
47	46		301								Camu	You hear that?	1																					
48	47		302								Wait...	48																						
49	48		202							1																								
50	49		301									The dark Construct is standing by the door, veins on his temples throbbing, as wrathful as he had been a number of days ago.																						
51	50		201							1	500175	5																						
52	51		301							1	Camu	Don't "wait" me!	1																					
53	52		301								Camu	I hate waiting. I hate being on the receiving end. I hate being the one who always has to comply!	1																					
54	53		301								Camu	What about your so-called sense of responsibility as a commandant? You brought me here... forced me to do all sorts of things like a clown... and then you're just leaving me? You're just handing me over to someone else?	1																					
55	54		302								I'm not‚Äî	55																						
56	55		301								Camu	You're the one who gave me a gift I didn't want... the one who forced me to train with you... the one who acted like an idiot to defend me.	1																					
57	56		301								Camu	You're the human who taught me that it's safe to feel "love". The human who extended your hand to me.	1																					
58	57		301								Camu	You barged into my life without invitation... and decided to just abandon me without a care. You're worse than my mentor!	1																					
59	58		202							1																								
60	59		301									Rage boiling into inarticulate abandon, Camu bursts out laughing instead. He crosses his arms around himself defensively.																						
61	60		301									You can hear his heaving breaths and thumping heartbeat. To a Construct, these features simply "simulate biological reactions," but at this moment they feel like proof of his red-hot passion, proof that he's alive.																						
62	61		201							1	500175																							
63	62		301							1	Camu	Do I look like a monster, huh?	1																					
64	63		301								Camu	I don't care how those people choose to deal with me.	1																					
65	64		301								Camu	All I want to know is what I'm like in your eyes.	1																					
66	65		301								Camu	When those guys from Babylonia asked if I wanted to stay with you, I said yes.	1																					
67	66		301								Camu	Now, I want your answer.	1																					
68	67		202							1																								
69	68		301									...																						
70	69		301									Right on cue, Asimov starts gathering his files.																						
71	70		201							1	500004																							
72	71		301							1	Asimov	I'll let you two talk. Gotta go analyze some data.	1																					
73	72		302								W-wait!	73																						
74	73		202							1																								
75	222		401							2	1516																							
76	74		301									Asimov simply ignores it all and walks past Camu towards the door.																						
77	75		301									You turn to Camu, who looks utterly humiliated.																						
78	76		302								You misunderstood.	77																						
79	77		201							1	500175																							
80	78		301							1	Camu	...?	1																					
81	79		401							1	208																							
82	80		302								I'm not leaving you.	81																						
83	81		302								We were talking about ending the simulated missions.	82																						
84	82		302								The Council approved of you fighting actual battles.	86																						
85	86		301								Camu	...Huh?	1																					
86	87		301									The youth looks so dumbfounded you almost feel guilty.																						
87	88		302								Also, I feel like I'm understanding you better...	89																						
88	89		302								Not because of the M.I.N.D. connection...	90																						
89	90		302								But because we spent time together...	91																						
90	91		302								And that was how I got to know you better.	92																						
91	92		301								Camu	...	1																					
92	93		302								Even if I didn't really understand you that well...	94																						
93	94		302								I'll still work hard in my own way.	95																						
94	95		302								I'll do my best to be a good commandant.	96																						
95	96		301								Camu	...	1																					
96	97		301								Camu	You're my commandant.	1																					
97	98		301								Camu	This fact makes me feel... "safe".	1																					
98	99		202							1																								
99	100		301									Camu steps forward, shortening the distance between the two of you, his dark pupils glowing.																						
100	101		201							1	500175																							
101	102		301							1	Camu	From now on, I won't wait for you to extend your hand anymore.	1																					
102	103		202							1																								
103	104		301									There is a knock on the door and you hear Liv's voice.																						
104	105		301								Liv	Excuse me‚ÄîOh, Commandant, are you busy?																						
105	106		302								What's going on?	107																						
106	107		301								Liv	I ran into Asimov... He said you're busy in the training room and we shouldn't disturb you.																						
107	108		301									Your face heats up suddenly for no reason. Camu takes a step back. His gaze meets yours, sending what feels like an electric current down your spine before moving away.																						
108	109		201							1	500175																							
109	110		301							1	Camu	...Hey.	1
