5	5		301								Mechanoid	We, are, robots of the aviation center.																						
6	6		301								Mechanoid	We've been waiting for more friends, but, nobody came.																						
7	7		301								Mechanoid	That's why, we, assemble. We will go to space, to search.

12	12		301								Nanami	...Don't be so down... None of that is real! I will never let that happen!	1																					
13	13		301									She grabs Haicma's hand.																						
14	14		301								Nanami	Thank you, Haicma... I will go back and change everything!	1

18	18		301									Haicma awkwardly looks down at her hand. She seems hesitant about whether she should do the same in return.																						
19	19		301								Haicma	...I do not understand.	2																					
20	20		204							2	3																							
21	21		301								Haicma	Are you able to travel back in time, Sagemachina?	2																					
22	22		301								Nanami	When I first arrived, I didn't know exactly what happened. After witnessing so many sad stories, I came to realize that...	1																					
23	23		301								Nanami	Just like mecha babushka told me when she sent me here. This is the future of Earth. This is the doomsday for humanity.	1																					
24	24		301								Nanami	Mecha babushka must be hoping that I can figure out what has happened, so I can avoid the catastrophic future...	1																					
25	25		204							2	10																							
26	26		301								Haicma	Are you suggesting... that I am but a piece of data simulated in a program?	2																					
27	27		204							1	7																							
28	28		301								Nanami	That's not what I mean...!	1																					
29	29		204							2	1																							
30	30		301								Haicma	There is no need to worry. I am not feeling the emotion of "sadness." I was created from data that was entered to the program in the first place. There is no much difference.	2																					
31	31		204							1	4																							
32	32		301									Haicma grabs Nanami's hands in return. She speaks in a serious tone.																						
33	33		301								Haicma	This world is everything I have experienced. To me, this place and its history are real. This is where I belong.	2																					
34	34		204							2	10																							
35	35		301									Haicma lowers her head. She seems to have a lot to say despite the "hundred years" of gap between her and Nanami, but she only smiles in the end.																						
36	36		204							2	1																							
37	37		301								Haicma	Then I wish you all the best in your world.	2																					
38	38		202							1	2				1																			
39	39		301									There is not much time for Nanami to bid farewell. Haicma watches her climb up the mech, connecting the port to the back of her neck.

42	42		301								Nanami	Haicma... Thank you! When I'm back to the real world, I will make sure to meet you soonerâ€”	1																					
43	43		301									As Nanami gets connected, a light glow has circled her body, making her look like a goddess descending into the snowy plains. The wailing wind has removed all colors in the world. There is no boundary between the land and the sky. Only the mountain continues to run at the very end of horizon.																						
44	44		201							1	500478	10																						
45	45		301							1	Haicma	Nanami...	1																					
46	46		301									Haicma's white hair flies in the snowy wind. There is a nostalgic look on her face. Her lips are moving as if she is saying something.
