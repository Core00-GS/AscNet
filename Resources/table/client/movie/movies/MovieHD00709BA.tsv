3	3		301			DialogEnable						Reluctantly, you have all decided to travel with Nanami.																						
4	4		301									You follow her to an abandoned mall inside City 015, where fallen shelves and items have scattered all over the place. Yet, there is a certain order to it, as if someone has briefly cleaned up the area.																						
5	5		302								So... what were those?	6

8	8		301							1	Nanami	They're my new discovery here!	2																					
9	9		301								Nanami	They're a very important part of my battle strategy, which was why Nanami had a plan to hunt them down!	2																					
10	10		301								Nanami	But now it's all messed up because of you! Aye-yi-yi-yi!	2																					
11	11		301								Bianca	Hunt them down? So you mean you were trying to deal with them?	1																					
12	12		301								Nanami	Well, I don't want them to wander about. It's dangerous out here!	2																					
13	13		302								That's it?	14	Dangerous?	15																				
14	14	16	301								Nanami	...And a few other things. I'll explain later.	2																					
15	15		301								Nanami	To them, duh! Just now they would've been "purified" if they weren't careful, wouldn't they?!	2																					
16	16		301								Nanami	...Regardless, Nanami does things her way! I never act without reasons!	2																					
17	17		301								Nanami	I was trying to deal with them alright! But you've disrupted my plan, so you have to fix it by doing exactly what I tell you to! Nanami's got a plan!	2																					
18	18		201							1	1111001		-400																					
19	19		301							1	Karenina	Your... plan? You aren't acting on instinct for once, Nanami!	1																					
20	20		204							2	1																							
21	21		301								Nanami	I'd like to be one of the smart ones once in a while, is what it is.	2																					
22	22		204							2	8																							
23	23		301							1	Nanami	After all, I couldn't have "instinct" them from the mine they were inhabiting to here, could I?	2																					
24	24		302							776	The mine?	27	Inhabiting?	28																				
25	25		204							2																								
26	26		303							776																								
27	27	29	301								Nanami	...Something wrong with that?	2																					
28	28		301								Nanami	I mean, they couldn't have popped up out of nowhere, right? Like, you pop up from Babylonia—same idea.	2																					
29	29		302								So what's your plan?	30																						
30	30		301								Nanami	Hunt them down, I told you! To lure them here from where they were...	2																					
31	31		301								Karenina	Is that possible? How would you do that?	1																					
32	32		301								Nanami	If we want to hunt something, first, we'll need to collect bait!	2																					
33	33		302								Bait?	34	Collect?	34																				
34	34		204							2	1																							
35	35		301								Nanami	Exactly! And Nanami knows where you can find baits. After that, we just need to dress it up a bit...	2																					
36	36		301								Karenina	What bait are we talking about here?	1																					
37	37		204							2	8																							
38	38		301								Nanami	Information classified! You'll find out when the time is right!	2																					
39	39		204							2																								
40	40		301								Nanami	Although Nanami could've handled it by herself, it wouldn't hurt to have a few extra pairs of hands helping if we want to hunt them down... It takes a while to collect the baits, after all.	2																					
41	41		301								Karenina	Who says I'm helping?!	1																					
42	42		301								Karenina	Hey, Bianca, let's go find that thing ourselves! You wouldn't join this ridiculous plan of hers, right?	1

45	45		301							1	Bianca	...Commandant, what are you thinking?	1																					
46	46		302								I guess we have to listen to Nanami for now.	47																						
47	47		202							1					1																			
48	48		301									Defeated, Karenina shakes her head. But she was the one who rushed to help Nanami in the first place, so she cannot make herself sit it out.																						
49	49		201							1	1111001	5																						
50	50		301							1	Karenina	...Fine! I can't leave you alone, now, can I? What if something happens to you?	1																					
51	51		201							1	1091001																							
52	52		301							1	Bianca	Just to be safe, please come with us as well, Commandant.	1																					
53	53		302								Sure.	54
