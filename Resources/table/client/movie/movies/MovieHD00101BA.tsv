16	14		302								You're not Gray Raven!	15	What are you guys doing?	16																				
17	15	17	301							1	Sophia	We're the new Gray Raven.	2

22	20		301							1	Ayla	The truth is...	3																					
23	21		301							1	Ayla	Because you've been away for too long, Commandant, the real Gray Raven was disbanded by HQ not long ago.	3																					
24	22		301							1		Nanami seems to be hiding something, but Ayla chimes in and reveals the surprising truth.																						
25	23		301							1		If Gray Raven was disbanded, then why is the office still here? Why are those three still standing there? Just as you are about to ask...

32	29		302								Lee?	30	I thought Gray Raven was disbanded?	31																				
33	30	415	301							1	Lee	Why do you look so surprised...? You didn't really get fooled by those three, did you?	3																					
34	31	415	301							1	Lee	It's just a prank from Nanami and the others... Don't take it seriously, Commandant.	3

39	34		301							1	Bianca	Indeed. That was another prank by Nanami and the others, though I am surprised at their level of commitment to the gag, volunteering for housesitting duty.	1																					
40	35		301							1		Bianca and Karenina follow. The two Purifying Force members and Lee seem to be carrying something.																						
41	36		302								What's that you got there?	37	Here, let me help.	38																				
42	37	39	301							1	Karenina	Hmph, this here is a little something Bianca and I prepared. Telling you would ruin the surprise!	2																					
43	38	39	301							1	Karenina	You're the star today, so you sit your Commandant butt down on the sofa... Don't pull another one of your disappearing acts on me again, okay?	2

65	59		301							1	Kamui	Watanabe prepared a long speech, but it was reduced to these two sentences by the time I received it. I guess the deleted part is saved for when you two meet.	3

83	73		301							1	Lucia	Commandant, I don't know if there will be more missions that require you to be away for such a long time, but at least you'll be staying for the near future, right?	1
