15	15		301									No ground missions. No meetings. Today, you've spent the entire morning in the training room.																						
16	16		301									At noon, you visit the WGAA to collect the file you asked Ayla to help find, and plan on checking up on No. 21.																						
17	17		301									You weren't expecting your plans to go right out the window.																						
18	18		301									—You now stand outside of your room, staring at the scene inside.

24	23		301								Liv	...Commandant, I know you've been busy... But you still need to tidy up your room.	1																					
25	24		301								Liv	At least pick up a little bit. You can't just throw everything on the ground like that.	1																					
26	25		301								Liv	And also... Um...	1

37	35		302								What happened?!	36	And why's there hypertune material?!	36																				
38	36		301									With no clear place to step, you see a white Construct sitting among the mess, trying to stuff a strange CUB into a box.

112	109		301								No. 21	I've thought you smelled nice ever since I first met you.	1																					
113	110		301									As No. 21 stiffly attempts to convey her inner thoughts, she approaches you step-by-step.																						
114	111		301									She's just like a wild animal who bears their fangs at distant enemies and snuggles up to their trusted companions, snoring gently.																						
115	112		301								No. 21	I feel different every time I see you, 【kuroname】.	1																					
116	113		301								No. 21	But I don't hate this feeling.	1

118	115		302								Why are you staring at me?	116																						
119	116		301								No. 21	Because I can't take my eyes off you.	1																					
120	117		301								No. 21	Is that wrong?	1																					
121	118		301									No. 21 tilts her head and appears to be contemplating if she said something wrong.																						
122	119		301									Her expression is so charming, you can't help but reach out and pet the top of her head.																						
123	120		301									Right as you are about to retract your hand, No. 21 lifts her head and rubs it against your hand, her soft cheeks touching your palm.																						
124	121		301									Gradually, the artificial sunlight outside the window begins to set.																						
125	122		301									Warm light fills the room, enveloping you and No. 21 in a warm glow.																						
126	123		301									Suddenly, you notice that the sunlight is as warm as it was the first day you met.
