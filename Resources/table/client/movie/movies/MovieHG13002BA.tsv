4	4		301									The lights in Babylonia are already dimmed and replaced with a brilliant starry sky on the virtual ceiling.																						
5	5		301									Unlike the ground surface, there are never dark clouds to block the starry sky up here.																						
6	6		301									Every resplendent star in the virtual night sky is twinkling like gems embedded on a canvas. If one walks a little further forward, one can see real planets floating in the vast, deep space behind the windows.																						
7	7		301									They look incredibly close, like a hope within reach that shines on people late at night.																						
8	8		301									It has been many days since Noan became a temporary staff of the library. He has been gazing at the night sky.																						
9	9		301									When he has no training or does not need to attend check-ups and research, he would come here to help the very few visitors look for their books.																						
10	10		301									Occasionally, a few people who knew his situation would turn away, but most visitors don't know the secret behind this "temporary staff" yet.																						
11	11		301									Like Simon said, there aren't many customers in the cafe either.																						
12	12		301									When he is free, he would learn how to make drinks from the service robots, or take a book with the cover he likes to read in order to spend the abundant time he has.																						
13	13		201							1	500506																							
14	14		301							1	Noan	...	1																					
15	15		301									Before he realizes it, the time has already passed midnight.																						
16	16		204							1	10																							
17	17		301									Noan puts down the book and rubs his shoulder that was damaged in an experiment during the day.																						
18	18		204							1																								
19	19		301									He is supposed to complete his schedule as the training room is free, but the familiar night sky above has caught his attention.																						
20	20		301									Back when he was a human on Earth, night always meant danger. But in Babylonia, night has become a symbol of peace.																						
21	21		301									In the daytime, Noan must work with the Science Council to perform check-ups and experiments.																						
22	22		301									...Which is never a relaxing experience.																						
23	23		301									When there is a need for a simulated environment or stress test, he may even suffer damage from a large number of battles.																						
24	24		301								Noan	...Better call it a day.	1																					
25	25		301									He puts away the book he just finished and takes out a few pieces of paper collected over the past few days, moves his fingers, and tries to sketch the night sky.																						
26	26		301									The last time he drew something, he was still near the Forsaken base. As a night watch, he must stay awake throughout the night.																						
27	27		301									Back then, there was no pen or paper. He could only scribble with a burnt branch.																						
28	28		301								Noan	All right then...	1																					
29	29		401							2	1513																							
30	30		301									The lines on the paper form the rough outline of buildings and stars. When he is about to add more details, he suddenly hears some rushed steps.																						
31	31		204							1	7																							
32	32		301									Out of instinct, he quickly crushes the sketch into a ball and gets up.																						
33	33		204							1	1																							
34	34		301								Noan	What can I do for you?	1																					
35	35		301									The person just walks past with a head lowered and goes all the way to the furthest corner behind the bookshelves, completely not realizing there is still a staff in the late-night library.

49	49		301									Gazing at the human in the corner, he realizes Simon was not "thinking too much."																						
50	50		301								Noan	(Definitely in need of more rest... Better leave that commandant alone.)	1																					
51	51		301									Just before he sits down, another new visitor enters the library.																						
52	52		204							1	1																							
53	53		301								Noan	What can I do for you?	1																					
54	54		301									The new visitor also ignores Noan. She just keeps looking around as if she is trying to find something.																						
55	55		201							1	500466																							
56	56		301							1	Guest	Excuse me, have you seen the Gray Raven Commandant?	1																					
57	57		301								Guest	I thought I saw a familiar figure walking this way... I have always wanted to meet that senior.	1																					
58	58		301									When she mentions "senior", Noan has finally noticed her uniform. She seems to be a student of F.O.S. College.																						
59	59		201							1	500506																							
60	60		301							1	Noan	The Gray Raven Commandant...?	1																					
61	61		301									He looks from the corner of his eye. That commandant is sitting in a corner at the very far end, buried inside books and terminal with a tired face.																						
62	62		301								Noan	...	1																					
63	63		301								Noan	Sorry, I didn't see that person.	1																					
64	64		201							1	500466																							
65	65		301								Guest	Okay...	1																					
66	66		301									She shakes her head in disappointment.																						
67	67		301								Guest	I thought I could meet the legendary Chief Graduate.	1																					
68	68		201							1	500506	1																						
69	69		301							1	Noan	See you next time.	1																					
70	70		204							1																								
71	71		301									Noan watches her leave. He sits down once again and takes out the paper he just hid.																						
72	72		204							1	16																							
73	73		301									Then he realizes he has crumpled the sketch again.																						
74	74		301									He seems to have that habit ever since he developed the hobby of drawing.																						
75	75		301									Is it because he always got scolded when others found out about this "unproductive" hobby?																						
76	76		301								Noan	...	1																					
77	77		301									Deep in his mind, he still subconsciously feels that he "should not draw" even when there is no customer.																						
78	78		204							1	10																							
79	79		301									Noan sighs, then spreads out the crumpled paper with his hand.																						
80	80		204							1																								
81	81		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					He ignores the commandant in the corner and continues to sketch the night sky on the wrinkled paper, cherishing the undisturbed tranquility.																						
82	82		202							1					1																			
83	83		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						More than four hours have passed when he finally finishes this casual sketch of the starry sky.																						
84	84		301									Noan folds up the paper and places it on the desk. He looks at that corner once again, only to see the human commandant still gazing at the desk, looking more exhausted than before.																						
85	85		201							1	500506																							
86	86		301							1	Noan	...	1																					
87	87		301									He stands up and begins to make a drink that he recently learned from the recipe. Too focused on what he is doing, he has no idea when the Gray Raven Commandant has walked behind him.																						
88	88		302								Are you drawing the starry night here?	89																						
89	89		204							1	9																							
90	90		301									Still holding a glass, Noan's hand visibly shakes when he hears the question.																						
91	91		204							1																								
92	92		301								Noan	No, it was just a piece of scrap paper. Sorry I forgot to clean up.	1																					
93	93		301									He quickly walks over and crushes the drawing into a paper ball, throwing it into the bin.																						
94	94		301								Noan	Are you going back?	1																					
95	95		302								Not yet.	96	Still have something to do.	96																				
96	96		301				DialogDisable				Noan	I see. This one's on me.	1																					
97	97		302								...	98																						
98	98		302								Why did you lie?	99																						
99	99		302								It's easier to earn trust if you are honest.	100																						
100	100		301			DialogEnable					Noan	You look like you want to spend some time alone. It's not like she is having anything important.	1																					
101	101		301									He puts a full cup in front of the human.																						
102	102		302								Thanks.	103																						
103	103		301								Noan	What about you? Why did you come to the library at midnight?	1																					
104	104		302								There's still work to do.	105																						
105	105		301								Noan	I assume Gray Raven's preparation room is more comfortable than here.	1																					
106	106		302								I don't want to make them worry.	107	...	108																				
107	107	109	301								Noan	Them... You mean the other three members of Gray Raven?	1																					
108	108		301								Noan	Did you just run out because you didn't want other Gray Raven members to worry?	1																					
109	109		204							1	10																							
110	110		301									He lets out a sigh.																						
111	111		204							1																								
112	112		301								Noan	There is no work that must be completed at the cost of your life. If you know they are worried about you, why don't you rely on them a bit more?	1																					
113	113		302								I am already relying on them a lot.	114	I can do this by myself.	114																				
114	114		301								Noan	Is that so?	1																					
115	115		301								Noan	Do you think... you look healthy right now?	1																					
116	116		301									The human just holds the cup up and sips at the drink without answering.																						
117	117		301				AniZhuanchangBegin		2000			Noan stops asking. He just opens the book again and starts to read.																						
118	118		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Both remain silent until Babylonia's virtual sky begins to light up.																						
119	119		301								Noan	If you are willing to tell me... If there is anything I can help...	1																					
120	120		301								Noan	As someone who once received your help and has nothing to do right now, I'd like to do my part.	1																					
121	121		302								Thanks in advance then.	122	I don't need your help.	123																				
122	122	124	301								Noan	I should thank you instead. After all, I really have nothing to do right now.	1																					
123	123		301								Noan	I need. I want to help you. After all, I really have nothing to do right now.	1																					
124	124		301								Noan	But it's already past five o'clock in the morning. Gray Raven is going to worry more if you keep staying here. We can talk about this after you have a good rest. You should go.	1																					
125	125		302								...Okay.	126	Alright.	126																				
126	126		301				DialogDisable					The human walks over with half a cup of drink.																						
127	127		302								Thanks for your drink.	128																						
128	128		302								Take this as a token of appreciation.	129																						
129	129		301			DialogEnable						Commandant hands over a notebook with Gray Raven's symbol on it, and a nicely wrapped cookie.																						
130	130		302								Oh, and the drawing just now...	131																						
131	131		301				DialogDisable				Noan	It's just scrap paper. Don't worry.	1																					
132	132		302								This isn't anything valuable either.	133																						
133	133		302								Just a normal notebook issued for Gray Raven.	134																						
134	134		302								And the cookie was bought when I walked past Zone L.	135
