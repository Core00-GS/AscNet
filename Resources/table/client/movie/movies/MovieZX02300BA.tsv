82	82		301								Lee	That's not for you to worry about.	2																					
83	83		301								Lee	We will take you and the other casualty Lucia brought back to the conservation area for a professional evaluation to assess the necessary provisions.	2																					
84	84		301								Construct Soldier	You mean... that other member from Gray Raven? Liv? She didn't come here with you?	1																					
85	85		301								Lee	She is staying in the conservation area to help tend to the wounded. She's the only qualified medic there now.	2

180	180		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						This disaster is dragging us slowly into Hell. No place to hide. No path to flee.																						
181	181		301									After the fire in the Forest Park Ruins goes out, hordes of Hetero-Creatures emerge worldwide. Overwhelming and unstoppable, they slaughter all living beings that stand in their way.																						
182	182		301									Under cascading death, the harm caused by the Unidentified Twins is actually negligible.																						
183	183		301									A tide of Hetero-Creatures wanders aimlessly through the wilderness, spreading footprints of grief and death through this rotten land.																						
184	184		301									The twins left among the ashes walk toward the west coast, robbing language and knowledge from dead humans and Constructs along the way.																						
185	185		301									After arriving at the west coast, instead of crossing the sea, they continue to move northward along the coast.																						
186	186		301									They join the barrage of Hetero-Creatures in the battle against humans and Constructs stationed in the defense zone, resulting in the destruction of the conservation areas in 37 cities and leaving no survivors.																						
187	187		301									When the garrison sensed that there was no chance of victory, they had no choice but to resort to avoidance tactics, predicting their action trajectory and withdrawing in advance.																						
188	188		301									These predictions are not always accurate. The enemy sometimes acts separately or stays in the same area for a long period of time.																						
189	189		301									But most of the time, the twins and the barrage of Hetero-Creatures "explore" one city for up to one to three days before proceeding to the next city.																						
190	190		301									In order to avoid getting ravaged and devastated by the approaching barrage, residents from adjacent cities flee in advance.																						
191	191		301									If the residents couldn't flee in time, they had no choice but to leave their future up to fate to decide.																						
192	192		301									If people choose to leave early because of fear, they will fall into the dilemma of competing for resources with residents of other cities.																						
193	193		301									These Hetero-Creatures are a barrage in every sense of the word, bringing death to the land wherever they inundate.																						
194	194		301									Under such a catastrophe, only one conservation area where the "twins" passed managed to survive. Only by retreating underground, had they not drawn the twins' attention.																						
195	195		301									However, when the garrison in the next conservation area attempted to adopt this tactic, they were instead burned to death underground.																						
196	196		301									These creatures grow in wisdom and learn how to use tools—evolving little by little.																						
197	197		301									However, no one can make a conclusive decision as to whether they have feelings and temperament in the biological sense.																						
198	198		301									Just as humans treat vegetation, they regard humans as a natural resource here on Earth.																						
199	199		301									They pick up lone humans, like cherishing the seeds, and return them to the crowd.																						
200	200		301									Although these humans would die of severe infection after coming into contact with the Punishing Virus, some people had witnessed the twins' "harmless" appearance.																						
201	201		301									Like appreciating flowers, the twins also "insert" the damaged and broken Constructs into the dense Red Tide and tell them with their chilling voices to become whole again.																						
202	202		301									Before they truly understand feelings and benevolence, humans cannot rely on communication. They can only escape the twins' tracks before being plundered.																						
203	203		301									At first, in order to avoid the high concentration of Punishing Virus on the surface, people planned to migrate to the Arctic Route Union, but these creatures began to venture northward.																						
204	204		301									With the barrage of the twins and the migrating Hetero-Creatures bringing danger to the northwest, people turned to the southeast for refuge.																						
205	205		301									With surface buildings in the conservation area lacking air-tight ventilation, CPFs can no longer ensure safety in such a high concentration of the Punishing Virus.																						
206	206		301									Most human beings live in the enclosed basement of the conservation area, leaving the resource collection and rescue operations to the Constructs.																						
207	207		301									Even if Scavengers are fitted with full sets of protective suits, their movements are still hindered by the threat of Hetero-Creatures.																						
208	208		301									When all the land outside the conservation area becomes entrenched with hidden dangers, supply consumption becomes a new problem.																						
209	209		301									People are in urgent need of rescue, but the transport crafts originally used for rescue only end up turning into fuel time and again.																						
210	210		301									We are forced to step into the eternal night of death, and with different language and bodies, roar as one in the afterburn of dawn.
