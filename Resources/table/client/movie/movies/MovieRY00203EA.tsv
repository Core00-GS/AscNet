3	3		301			DialogEnable						Although Nanami cannot tell why the hat-wearing program would try to help her, she has still managed to get rid of the odd-behaving programs, and she races toward the exit of the anomaly.																						
4	4		301									Despite being prepared, Nanami still loses her balance from the different sensory inputs of the two areas as she crosses the barrier.

6	6		301							1	Nanami	Uwah! Not again?!	1																					
7	7		301									Nanami lands on her face, and her running chainsaw flies from her hand to the side of a group of repair programs. They just mechanically pull the chainsaw out, and then thoroughly repair the cracked floor.																						
8	8		301									Climbing up, Nanami readjusts her frame's sensory input again before picking up her weapon. She carefully taps the head of one of the programs, and it pays her no attention.																						
9	9		301								Nanami	No reaction at all... I bet only the programs in the anomaly behave so strangely.	1																					
10	10		301									She wears the chainsaw on her back and tries to recollect what just happened inside the anomaly.																						
11	11		301								Nanami	It's obviously not normal for the programs to develop self-awareness. But for some reason, the repair programs outside would not respond to anything that happens inside the anomaly...	1																					
12	12		204							1	8																							
13	13		301								Nanami	Hmm... this is quite troublesome indeed! If the source isn't located, Nanami alone can't stop the anomaly from expanding...	1																					
14	14		301									As she scratches her head on her predicament, a familiar voice once again pops up in her mind.

17	17		301							1	???	The individual named Nanami! Entry without permission is illegal behavior. Remove yourself from the scene immediately and provide an incident report.	2																					
18	18		204							1																								
19	19		301								Nanami	Ah... That... that is...	1																					
20	20		301									Nanami cannot come up with a good excuse on the spot, but she remembers that there is something more important she needs to report.																						
21	21		204							1	5																							
22	22		301								Nanami	Right, forget that. Nanami has important information to share with mecha babushka!	1																					
23	23		301									Nanami's description is all over the place, and it comes with many unnecessary details, but she more or less manages to convey the danger of the anomaly.																						
24	24		301								???	Your report is acknowledged. In accordance with the defense protocol, I will now begin scanning the repair program network nodes...	2																					
25	25		301									Smugly, Nanami waits for the scan to complete, her head filled with ideas on how to accept mecha babushka's compliments.																						
26	26		301								???	Scan result... zero anomaly identified. No bugs detected beyond the scan parameter. Conclusion—repair operation is functioning as intended.	2																					
27	27		301								Nanami	That's not possible! You gotta check it again...	1																					
28	28		301								???	A correction on my previous conclusion—one anomaly detected.	2																					
29	29		301								Nanami	See? Nanami told you!	1																					
30	30		301								???	An anomaly caused by you, Nanami. Your illegal entry has disrupted the data flow, leading to a 0.04% delay in the repair operation. You must leave now.	2																					
31	32		301								Nanami	That can't be! Nanami is here to...	1																					
32	33		301								???	Cross-referencing the database and your activity log of today, I predict that it is highly likely that you will continue to commit "lying" and "civil disruption." I recommend an immediate termination of such behavior.	2																					
33	34		301								Nanami	No, I didn't do that!	1																					
34	35		301								???	Another possible lie. Please leave this place immediately. If there is indeed a bug, the repair programs will automatically correct it. We do not require inspection from a sole operative.	2																					
35	36		301								Nanami	Sob... If you're not going to believe Nanami, then fine!	1																					
36	37		301									Nanami pulls a face at the empty space before her, then she turns around and stares at the barrier to the anomaly before shaking her head eventually.																						
37	38		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Nanami	It said it's not Nanami's business, so Nanami's out of here!	1
