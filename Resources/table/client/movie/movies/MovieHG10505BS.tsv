6	6		301							1	Lee	Come back here, you!	1																					
7	7		302								What happened?	8	Did Nanami take something from you, Lee?	8																				
8	8		301								Lee	Nanami suddenly burst in and took the remote while I was sorting out the storage.	1																					
9	9		301								Lee	It's impossible to catch up with that new frame of hers...	1																					
10	10		302								Looks like you're having a hard time, Lee.	11	What controller did she take?	14																				
11	11		204							1	10																							
12	12		301								Lee	A headache can't describe all the pain she has caused.	1																					
13	13		204							1																								
14	14		301								Lee	The remote she took was a long-distance type T1 series.	1																					
15	15		204							1	10																							
16	16		301								Lee	It's hard to say what she wants to do with it since it can be used for a wide range of things.	1																					
17	17		204							1																								
18	18		301								Lee	Commandant, I heard she's been collecting materials recently, do you know anything about it?	1																					
19	19		302								Reactors and metals.	20	Um... No...?	23																				
20	20		204							1	10																							
21	21		301								Lee	She's not planning to make a bomb... is she?	1																					
22	22	24	204							1																								
23	23		301								Lee	That's very suspicious, what are you hiding?	1																					
24	24		301								Lee	But she probably wouldn't do anything to harm us.	1																					
25	25		302								And here I thought you doubted her.	26	Yeah, Nanami is a good girl.	27																				
26	26	30	301								Lee	Just keep an eye on her, you never know what she'll do if you let her roam free.	1																					
27	27		204							1	10																							
28	28		301								Lee	A good girl... She probably wouldn't be happy with that.	1																					
29	29		204							1																								
30	30		301								Lee	Anyway, it may not be her intention, but considering what has happened in the past, I fear that something bad may happen this time...	1																					
31	31		301								Lee	For example, building a bomb from the materials she collected.	1																					
32	32		204							1	10																							
33	33		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lee	Hm... I'm probably overthinking.	1
