34	34		301								Roland	(That doesn't sound like she's talking to a teammate. Is she linked to someone?)	1																					
35	35		301									If she is linked... Roland remembers what Lamia heard about the Commandant of Gray Raven. Plus, the Commandant of Cerberus isn't around either.

41	41		301									Baffled, shocked, fear, followed by hope—																						
42	42		301									Roland never sees the cycle and intertwining of these expressions in the same face.																						
43	43		401							2	1513
