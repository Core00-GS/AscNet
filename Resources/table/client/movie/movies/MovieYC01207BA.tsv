15	17		301								Gabriel	How unexpected. You have Huaxu in your hands, yet you did not notice my presence...	1																					
16	18		301								Gabriel	Ah. No. Precisely because you "have" Huaxu, that you were unable to detect me. You have worked hard, my comrade.	1

26	25		302								What's this?	26	Is this Huaxu?	27																				
27	26	28	301								Gabriel	A part of Huaxu. Pretty as a diamond, is it not?	2																					
28	27	28	301								Gabriel	This is a part of Huaxu, a type of backdoor authentication. Qu seems to have put the true Huaxu elsewhere.	2																					
29	28		301								Gabriel	It is a shard. But the part, is the whole. Control this, and control the system. Which is why Qu wanted you to take this.	2

54	43		301								Gabriel	We filter out individuals suitable for survival in the next world, and invite them to join our ranks.	1
