4	4		301								Assistant A & B	Understood.																						
5	5		301									The assistants help prepare the Construct on the maintenance bed according to Wanshi's instructions. Wanshi changes into dustproof clothes and stands in the center of the maintenance room. An assistant approaches him at that moment.																						
6	6		301								Assistant A	Doctor Wanshi, a Construct was taken to maintenance room 13.																						
7	7		301								Wanshi	Turn on data projection.																						
8	8		301									Wanshi nods as he looks at the scan of the Construct in maintenance room 13 and says to the assistant.																						
9	9		301								Wanshi	The auxiliary circulatory system of the lower chamber is damaged. Help me start the remote maintenance kit in maintenance room 13.																						
10	10		301								Assistant A	Huh, but that would take a huge toll on your mind.																						
11	11		301									Wanshi takes several connecting wires from the kit terminal aside and attaches them to his head, ignoring the assistant's persuasion.																						
12	12		301								Wanshi	Testing connection.																						
13	13		301									The view of maintenance room 13 is revealed by the kit terminal, several robotic arms lifting the maintenance tools in turn under Wanshi's control. The damaged parts of the Construct are magnified through the microscope, and the gathered data is displayed on the dials of the robotic arms.																						
14	14		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Wanshi	That's alright. We'll fix them at the same time.

26	24		301									However, when Wanshi is stepping back, he suddenly stumbles on his feet. Everything in the maintenance room seems illusory and distant to him. He reaches out to the left, and the touch of the wall brings him back to reality. He keeps his footing by holding onto the wall.

38	33		301								Wanshi	Is that so... I didn't feel any different.	1																					
39	34		301								Wanshi	Constructs can feel pain just as well as humans. Isn't it a doctor's job to ease their pain?	1																					
40	35		301								Assistant B	We could just turn off their pain module or use recalling after the frame is fixed.	2																					
41	2000		204							1																								
42	36		301								Wanshi	We only advise them to do so when they're suffering unbearable pain.	1																					
43	37		301								Wanshi	Besides, making a new frame is much more difficult than maintaining it... Otherwise, our work would be meaningless.	1																					
44	38		301								Assistant B	Speaking of which, I often heard you use recalling to comfort the Constructs during the adjustment.	2																					
45	39		301								Wanshi	Well... it's part of our duty to help them return to the battlefield.	1

67	60		301									Lies, ill-intended or not, are alterations to reality.																						
68	61		301									The moment you see beyond the lies and find reality, a certain string will begin to tighten... or snap.

77	70		301								Professor	Yes, some lives are more equal than others in the Star of Life, a place that is supposed to save all lives.	2																					
78	71		301								Professor	Our Construct Maintenance Department, which was established by the military and the Science Council, is basically a slaughterhouse covered with lies.	2																					
79	72		301								Wanshi	Then the so-called recalling...	1																					
80	73		301								Professor	The Constructs known to the public that have been recalled and returned to the battlefields are nothing more than exceptions shaped by the military to be inspirations.	2																					
81	74		301								Professor	They weren't using recalls, but an arduous operation that extracted the Constructs' memories. By controlling the time difference, they created an illusion of a recall.	2																					
82	200		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Professor	This means that not every Construct is immortal. Their demise on the fields also spells their farewell to this world.	2

98	87		301								Professor	The memory extraction operation is different from the frame replacement one, which is done with precise instruments and professional assistance.	2																					
99	88		301								Professor	It's a dangerous and complicated technique to perform memory extractions on the battlefield and strip the M.I.N.D. from the frame, which might even result in the loss of memory data.	2																					
100	89		301								Professor	And what is recalling known for?	2																					
101	1001		301								Professor	That we could quickly activate it on the verge of death and safely transfer the Constructs' memories to Babylonia at the cost of a slight deviation in their M.I.N.D.s.	2																					
102	1002		301								Professor	If it's so easy to achieve the same effect as a memory extraction, why would we continue to delve into the mysteries of the M.I.N.D. to improve the success rate of those operations?	2

113	97		301								Wanshi	This is...	1																					
114	98		301								Professor	It's a list of Constructs that have enabled recalling. It also records the flow of data shortly after that.	2																					
115	99		301								Wanshi	How could it be... All those memories were...	1																					
116	100		301								Professor	Exactly. All of them were led into a void. They couldn't feel anything in the outside world, like a computer being shut down.	2																					
117	101		301								Professor	They thought their minds were freed, and one day someone outside will turn them on again.	2																					
118	102		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Professor	But the truth is that their memories were never separated from reality—they were also shattered by this war along with their fallen frames.	2
