3	3		301			DialogEnable						After following Vera and breaching several laboratories with force, you have finally arrived at the innermost area of the city.																						
4	4		301									This place is designed to be tightly sealed. Some of the gates, however, have fallen into disrepair, and water has poured inside.																						
5	5		301									But the water disappears again after you cross the last enclosed defense line.																						
6	6		301									The silhouette of the zero-point reactor emerges from the dark like a seamount forged with metal.																						
7	7		301									The two of you walk along the chasm between the mounts.																						
8	8		301									Way above you in the dark is an all-encompassing, ghostly blue light.																						
9	9		301									It is the ocean that envelops Atlantis. Right now, it shrouds the reactor like a sky.																						
10	10		301									Separating the reactor from the force of the water is a layer of thick, transparent tempered glass.																						
11	11		301									The glass wall is so clear that it almost looks like nothing is there. Staring at it for too long, you would think that the water itself has formed the wall, unmoving.																						
12	12		301									The large, indescribable pieces of the reactor look nothing like the cutting-edge technology they are. Instead, they look like an ancient ruin, a tomb as lofty as a sleeping mountain.																						
13	13		301									Inside the tomb buries the glorious but cold dream of the Golden Age. Inside it buries a time that would no longer wake.																						
14	14		201							1	500345																							
15	15		301							1	Vera	Why do you think they built this thing underwater?	1																					
16	16		202							1					1																			
17	17		301									You cannot answer her.																						
18	18		301									Plato's Atlantis ended up sinking in the ocean. But later some suggested that perhaps Atlantis had never broken the surface of the sea.																						
19	19		301									Perhaps it is the same for this reactor.																						
20	20		301									Maybe its architects back then had expected the reactor to fail from the beginning.																						
21	21		301									If the reactor goes out of control, the vast Atlantic Ocean will devour the base completely, like the tide swallowing a wave, like a wave absorbing a bubble.																						
22	22		201							1	500345																							
23	23		301							1	Vera	How ironic. If they were prepared for failure, why didn't they just stop?	1																					
24	24		301								Vera	We got to this point because they were trying to control a power that wasn't theirs.	1																					
25	25		202							1					1																			
26	26		301									The two of you keep going forward. The blue hue of the water casts the reactor in the shade of a glacier. Walking here feels like trekking through the depths of Antarctica, setting foot on the most barren no man's land.																						
27	27		301									Suddenly, Vera holds up a hand and stops you.																						
28	28		201							1	500345	4

34	34		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Hidden in the dark this whole time, the culprit who sank the city has finally revealed herself.																						
35	35		302								...!	36																						
36	36		301									Vera and you both recognize her at the same time. You know her.																						
37	37		201							1	500345	4																						
38	38		301							1	Vera	That's... the Ascendant with the Roland guy.	1																					
39	39		202							1					1																			
40	40		301									She takes her battle stance.																						
41	41		302								Lamia.	42																						
42	42		301									Lamia stands at the center of the reactor alone, her expression strange and adrift, not even hearing Vera's and your footsteps approaching.																						
43	43		301									She only reacts when Vera's spear is about to hit her.																						
44	44		301								Lamia	Eww... aaAAaaHH...																						
45	45		301								Lamia	Stay away... stay away...																						
46	46		301									She stumbles back.																						
47	47		301									You have fought her before, which is why you are certain of one thing—																						
48	48		301									Lamia is not quite herself right now.																						
49	49		201							1	500345	4																						
50	50		301							1	Vera	So the Ascendants are also looking for information on the zero-point reactor.	1																					
51	51		202							1					1																			
52	52		301									Lamia does not deny it, but maybe she does not even hear it.																						
53	53		301									Vera takes Lamia's silence as confirmation and charges forward with her spear.

55	55		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiHitNew.prefab	2																							
56	56		301									Lamia can not dodge fast enough, and the spearhead cuts off a strand of her hair. She looks at Vera, startled and angry, like a wounded dog whose territory is violated.																						
57	57		301								Lamia	Get out of here... Stay away... stay away!																						
58	58		301									At first, Lamia looks like she is going to strike back.																						
59	59		301									But then, her eyes are flooded with despair.																						
60	60		301									Eventually, all that is left in her eyes is hatred that borders on madness.																						
61	61		301									You have no idea why her emotions are changing so rapidly in mere seconds.																						
62	62		301								Lamia	Sink... just sink... Let it all sink to the bottom of the ocean with me.																						
63	63		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStory/FxUiStoryShuju.prefab	2																							
64	64		301									She steps back, and the air around her distorts.																						
65	65		301									You are familiar with that sight. She is trying to turn invisible and run.																						
66	66		302								She's going to escape!	68																						
67	67		401							2	597																							
68	68		301									Vera hisses before throwing the spear in her hand like a javelin toward where Lamia is standing.																						
69	69		301									It flies straight toward Lamia's face.

74	74		301									But the spearhead only pierces Lamia's projection. It goes right through it and buries deep into the wall behind.																						
75	75		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She has still escaped right beneath your noses.																						
76	76		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						It is quiet again. Vera frowns, pulling her banner spear out of the wall.																						
77	77		201							1	500345	5																						
78	78		301							1	Vera	What is going on here... Why would an Ascendant find out about this place?	1																					
79	79		301								Vera	Didn't the President say the coordinates of this location are a secret? How come even a small fish like her can find out?	1																					
80	80		302								The control panel.	81																						
81	81		204							1

90	90		301									The central control system is not as complicated as you imagine. Operation systems like this are built in a similar vein. The things you learned from Lee in your spare time have finally come in handy.

113	113		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Lustrous	Start reporting. You first.	1																					
114	114		301								Communication Director	Not much to say. All radio communications have been unresponsive, but our equipment is fine, which means the problem is the relay and the receiving end.	2																					
115	115		301								Lustrous	What's wrong with the relay?	1																					
116	116		301								Communication Director	Neither the satellites nor the servers on the mainlands have responded, suggesting that all surface and orbital communication networks have failed.	2																					
117	117		301								Lustrous	What's the worst-case scenario?	1																					
118	118		301								Communication Director	All human civilizations outside of this base have been annihilated.	2																					
119	119		301								Lustrous	How about a less bad one?	1																					
120	120		301								Communication Director	All 240 satellites in the sky and every server in Asia, Europe, and North America fail at the same time. They're too busy fixing them to answer our call.	2																					
121	121		301									Lustrous does not laugh.																						
122	122		301								Lustrous	What is the possibility of this scenario?	1																					
123	123		301									The communication director does not laugh either.																						
124	124		301								Communication Director	Less than ten to the power of negative seventeen. I checked it before the meeting. Twice.	2																					
125	125		301								Lustrous	Understood. It means we should proceed on the basis that human civilizations have ended.	1

143	143		202							1					1																			
144	144		301									Lustrous looks at the logistics director, who sits the furthest away from her.																						
145	145		201							1	500350		400																					
146	146		201							2	500139		-400																					
147	147		301							1	Logistics Director	Assuming our supply chain from the mainlands has been cut off, we can survive for a maximum of 15 months.	2																					
148	148		301								Lustrous	How do you get that number?	1																					
149	149		301								Logistics Director	I calculated the minimum calories all staff members needed based on their weights, then divided the total calories of food we got in the base by that number.	2																					
150	150		301								Logistics Director	It's just an estimated figure. Give me some time and I'll calculate a more accurate answer.	2																					
151	151		301								Lustrous	If we are to recreate the environment for the exploded first reactor, we need at least 21 months to figure out what happened there.	1																					
152	152		301									Lustrous gets lost in thought, but only for mere seconds.																						
153	153		301								Lustrous	How long will our supplies last if we reduce the personnel on the base?	1																					
154	154		301									She looks up and asks the logistics director.																						
155	155		301									The director pauses for a moment before answering.																						
156	156		301								Logistics Director	If we stop supplying the others and move all resources to the research department, we can last 23 months. Long enough for you to complete your research.	2																					
157	157		201							2	500361		-400																					
158	158		301							1	Medical Director	If I may.	2																					
159	159		301								Lustrous	Please.	1																					
160	160		301								Medical Director	I don't recommend doing so.	2																					
161	161		301								Lustrous	Your reason?	1																					
162	162		301								Medical Director	Programs and machines will break down. People will get sick from the lack of nutrients. This will all slow down your progress.	2																					
163	163		301								Medical Director	Not to mention that the communication department has been trying to contact any possible survivors or groups. If we can receive support from the outside world, our immediate crisis will be resolved.	2																					
164	164		301								Medical Director	To safeguard your research, we should prioritize the different departments and cut off supplies to the least important one first.	2																					
165	165		301								Lustrous	I agree.	1																					
166	166		202							1	2				1

168	168		201							1	500350																							
169	169		301							1	Lustrous	Then let's sort them. We'll cut off supplies to the administrative department first, then logistics. After that, medical, communication, robotics, data, and research.	1																					
170	170		301									She points at the directors around the table according to the order and, at last, she points at herself.																						
171	171		301								Lustrous	Objections?	1

182	182		301							1		The recording of the meeting is over. The screen flickers, and you see Lustrous' figure when the image becomes clear again.																						
183	183		301								Lustrous	To whoever sees this record in the future, my name is Lustrous, the research director.	1																					
184	184		301								Lustrous	This recording is set to public. Anyone who tries to access the central command system will activate this video. It plays automatically just in case someone fails to notice it.	1																					
185	185		301								Lustrous	I've put our first and final "group" meeting at the beginning of this video. I assume any human with common sense would understand what has happened to our base after watching it.	1																					
186	186		301								Lustrous	Presuming that you are an intelligent life such as a human, please allow me to skip to the main point.	1																					
187	187		301								Lustrous	I'm not sure what the exact time is now. The base has been in lockdown since the outbreak. We've given up on Greenwich Mean Time and instead opted for the base's timer as the time standard in our records.	1																					
188	188		301								Lustrous	So I might be wrong about the month and day, but I think the year should still be accurate: this is the third year since the outbreak of the Punishing Virus.	1																					
189	189		301								Lustrous	We have run out of food. No one's coming to save us. The most logical conclusion is that the human race beyond this base is extinct.	1																					
190	190		301								Lustrous	I'm not good at recording history, but if you're here and you've found this, then you must be a seeker who is curious. You're like me. I feel obligated to satisfy your curiosity.	1																					
191	191		301								Lustrous	Let me briefly describe what happened after that meeting.	1																					
192	192		301								Lustrous	We started rationing the moment we initiated the lockdown. The plan went well, and it allowed us to last for a very long time with very limited resources.	1																					
193	193		301								Lustrous	When food began to run short, we came to an unspoken agreement: the core researchers were prioritized with provisions, while the others were arranged in the order of their importance, the least of which will die first.	1																					
194	194		301								Lustrous	The first one to go was the administrative department. We didn't have any higher-ups to report to anymore, after all.	1																					
195	195		301								Lustrous	This island wasn't designed for our situation, so it doesn't have any corpse disposal facilities. We decided to administrate burials-at-sea to avoid the growth of germs and bacteria from the accumulating bodies.	1																					
196	196		301								Lustrous	Logistics was next. After that, I had to spend an extra 25 minutes each day traveling between the office and the storage to pick up the canned food and hardtacks. I had to learn how to organize files and do other trivial stuff.	1																					
197	197		301								Lustrous	It was the medical department afterward. They left behind detailed medical guides before they died. Those who remained were all very grateful for their generosity.	1																					
198	198		301								Lustrous	They were followed by the communication department. They had been diligent in their roles, trying to establish contact with the outside world, but it didn't work.	1																					
199	199		301									Her voice gets colder and colder as if she is just a machine with a warm, human body.																						
200	200		301								Lustrous	Robotics. Without those mechanics and engineers, I could only hope that nothing major broke before our research saw some results.	1																					
201	201		301								Lustrous	Data. Similarly, without the programmers, I could only pray that the servers and data banks wouldn't fail.	1																					
202	202		301								Lustrous	Research. It was our last and most essential department, the one under my lead. We made a list, and the one on top would die first. Since I was the key personnel here, they put me at the bottom.	1																					
203	203		301								Lustrous	Right, I also placed the non-staff members such as... children... in the middle. Given that they consumed less food and energy, and factoring in ethical concerns, I didn't place them in the first group to go.	1																					
204	204		301								Lustrous	Some of our colleagues had values that would have clashed quite strongly with the alternative. That could possibly stall our progress.	1																					
205	205		301								Lustrous	This is the first time I've done this kind of visual documentation. I never had to bother with this kind of trifling work in the past.	1																					
206	206		301								Lustrous	That's about it regarding the base after the outbreak. If the data department's server room is still intact, you will find our activity logs for the past three years there.	1																					
207	207		301								Lustrous	Now, I'm moving on to what we have achieved.	1																					
208	208		301								Lustrous	Zero-point reactors are highly classified, but if you're watching this right now, then you must already know that there is one such reactor in this facility.	1																					
209	209		301								Lustrous	After the lockdown, we tried to recreate the first reactor's failure in order to figure out how the Punishing Virus first appeared.	1																					
210	210		301								Lustrous	Long story short, we failed. We repeated some of the steps from the last log of that reactor and managed to create a similar environment, but the Punishing Virus didn't show up.	1																					
211	211		301								Lustrous	Correction. Not that it didn't show up—it appeared, but it was unobservable.	1																					
212	212		301								Lustrous	I don't know who is watching this right now and whether or not you have any knowledge regarding it, so I'll try my best to put it in layman's terms.	1																					
213	213		301								Lustrous	Reports from around the world and the first reactor told us what the physical effects would be when the Punishing Virus appeared. We didn't observe the virus directly, but our equipment detected those phenomena.	1																					
214	214		301								Lustrous	They disappeared soon after they manifested. Like raindrops, we couldn't see the virus, only the ripples it caused once it hit the water.	1																					
215	215		301								Lustrous	In other words, some kind of energy "absorbed" them.	1																					
216	216		204							1	8																							
217	217		301								Lustrous	If my department and I had another two years' worth of food, we might be able to figure out why it happened. But all my staff are dead now, and I just finished my last hardtack.	1																					
218	218		204							1																								
219	219		301								Lustrous	We've gone as far as we could. I couldn't catch the raindrop, but I found the water.	1																					
220	220		301								Lustrous	The "water" that absorbed the Punishing Virus. It'll take me way too long to explain the details, but I call that technology the "Omega File".	1																					
221	221		301								Lustrous	I've put it in my pocket. I'll be heading for the observatory at the highest part of the city after this recording.	1																					
222	222		301								Lustrous	I don't have samples and equipment to repeat our experiments, so I can't guarantee that Omega File would work outside of this base.	1																					
223	223		301									The cold "machine" shows a hint of warmth for a second, with sadness buried underneath it.																						
224	225		301								Lustrous	Regardless, seeker, or seekers—you have traveled this far. This is your reward.	1

228	229		301									Lustrous lets out a sigh.																						
229	230		301								Lustrous	Right, I wasn't planning to say the following in this record. Sentimental words always affect a person's rational judgment.	1																					
230	231		301								Lustrous	But I think I should give all of us one last opportunity to be capricious.	1																					
231	232		301								Lustrous	After that meeting, there were some among us who questioned if we had done the right thing.	1																					
232	233		301								Lustrous	While others were resolute in their answers. They believed we made the correct choice.	1																					
233	234		301								Lustrous	To be fair, the virus that destroyed the world was born from the first zero-point reactor. That did make many of us doubt the decision to continue our research.	1																					
234	235		301								Lustrous	But we still decided to carry out our duty til the very end.	1																					
235	236		301								Lustrous	We did not regret anything. We did what was right.	1																					
236	237		301								Lustrous	We would have chosen the same even if we could do it again. I think our colleagues in the first reactor would feel the same.	1

239	240		301								Lustrous	The only thing I regret is that this is as far as we can go.	1

241	242		301								Lustrous	But I hope any human that sees this remembers one thing—don't forget your desire to reach the stars. Don't lose your hunger to trek forward.	1																					
242	243		301								Lustrous	Don't lose the courage to go further just because we are being plundered.	1																					
243	244		301								Lustrous	Seize it, conquer it, fall, and stand again. Keep going.	1																					
244	246		301								Lustrous	I believe humanity will have a bright future.	1																					
245	247		301								Lustrous	I'm putting everything we have in your hands.	1																					
246	248		301								Lustrous	Now... I'm going to see my colleagues.	1
