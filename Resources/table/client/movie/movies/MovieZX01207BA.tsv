7	7		301							1	Gabriel	Not much progress. Kowloong is more powerful than we thought. And as far as I can tell, Lamia is having trouble as well.	3

9	9		301							1	Lamia	H-hey, I can speak for myself! Why am I getting bullied even on the comms?!	3

11	11		301							1	Gabriel	Sorry, I did not intend to offend...	3																					
12	12		301								Roland	Don't mind her. Let's do a sitrep to make sure we're all on the same page. Alpha and Miss Luna will be resting near where we met up, and will likely not join us. They might meet some stray resistance, but not much.	2																					
13	13		301								Gabriel	Indeed. Only the three of us are required. The mere presence of Miss Luna and Alpha is already more than helpful in inhibiting the enemies.	3																					
14	14		301								Roland	...	2																					
15	15		301								Roland	Anyway, though Kowloong stays still silent, more and more of their toy soldier Phecdas are getting deployed. It's only a matter of time before our temporarily-enhanced Corrupted get destroyed.	2																					
16	16		301								Gabriel	I take it you have a plan?	3																					
17	17		301								Roland	Since Kowloong's Constructs don't have Inver-Devices, we take advantage of our abilities as Ascendants and spread as much of the virus as possible.	2																					
18	18		301								Roland	When we have the place all fogged up, they'll become our little puppets.	2																					
19	19		301								Gabriel	We have been spreading the virus from the start. The effect might still take a while to show.	3																					
20	20		301								Roland	Which is why, until then, we stay on the defensive and play for time. That's the safest strategy.	2																					
21	21		301								Gabriel	That might contradict Miss Luna's plan... though I do agree with your suggestion.	3

25	24	701	301								Gabriel	I will mount an attack and spread the virus at the same time. You two should act as you both see fit.	3
