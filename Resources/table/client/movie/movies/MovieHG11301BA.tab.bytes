6	6		301								??	But hey, Gray Raven's commandant, right? Did something happen to the usual girl?

11	11		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Liv	Sorry, Commandant. I might need your help...	1																					
12	12		301								Liv	I'm usually the one to claim supplies for the squad every Thursday, but there's an emergency at the Star of Life. I'll have to go help...	1																					
13	13		302								No worries.	14	Leave this to me.	14																				
14	14		301								Liv	The officer there is called Ailes, and he's a very nice person! So don't worry, Commandant! Just give him the list and he'll get the supplies ready.	1																					
15	15		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	Thank you, Commandant!	1

19	19		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Ailes	Ah, I see... Hmm... Must be the squad that went missing in the frontlines. Heard Walker and the others talking about them this morning.	1																					
20	20		301								Ailes	What a world we live in. War that just never ends... Oh, the rack's empty, hang on a sec.	1																					
21	21		302								Thanks.	22	Missing...?	22																				
22	22		202							1		Ailes turns and scans his ID card, entering a room to the side. While waiting, you look around casuallyâ€”some hurried-looking workers from other departments, and some Constructs here for military supplies...																						
23	23		301									A red shade suddenly flirts into your eyes. That person seems to be in conversation.

25	25		201							2	500168		400																					
26	26		301							1		A woman with red hair. Furrowing her brows, she seems to be talking to a stranger. The man is gesturing brusquely and talking gruffly, to which she responds with a condescending smirk.																						
27	27		301									The woman then mutters something, which deflates the man almost instantly. He begins looking around nervously.																						
28	28		302								(What are they doing...?)	29

31	31		301							1	Ailes	Commandant? What's the matter? Took me ages to find you!	1																					
32	32		302								...!	33	...	33																				
33	33		301									The sudden exclamation removes you from your voyeuristic venture.																						
34	34		301								Ailes	Here. These should be the supplies you need. Please check and confirm.	1																					
35	35		302								Alright.	36	Thanks.	36																				
36	36		202							1																								
37	37		301									Ailes leaves after he hands the trunk of resources over to you. As if drawn by a flame, your gaze is helplessly tugged back to the corner with the woman, only to find her already absent.																						
38	38		301								??	Need anything?																						
39	39		201							1	500168	1																						
40	40		301							1	Vera	Peeping around like a rat, you can't be looking for me, can you?	1																					
41	41		302								Yes.	42	No.	44																				
42	42		301								Vera	Honest to a fault, hm?	1																					
43	43	46	301								Vera	But, well. I'm not in the mood right now. Need me for somethingâ€”try booking earlier. I might consider entertaining you for a few seconds.	1																					
44	44		301								Vera	Tsk, tskâ€”liar, liar.	1																					
45	45		301								Vera	Not into liars, uh-uh.	1																					
46	46		301									Vera crosses her arms, revealing a medical bagâ€”something she just acquiredâ€”before her torso. Noticing your eyes being drawn downward, she props both hands on her hips. A bemused shadow flickers past her eyes.																						
47	47		301								Vera	Whatcha looking at?	1																					
48	48		301								Vera	Ah. Or, should I say? You like what you see?	1																					
49	49		204							1	13																							
50	50		301								Vera	Having such true-to-yourself eyesâ€”you must have a death wish.	1																					
51	51		302								I didn't mean to.	52	S-sorry.	56																				
52	52		301								Vera	Apologize.	1																					
53	53		302								Sorry.	54																						
54	54		204							1	1																							
55	55	58	301								Vera	Apology accepted.	1																					
56	56		204							1	1																							
57	57		301								Vera	Apology accepted.	1																					
58	58		301								Vera	But before that... You wondering about what I was doing?	1																					
59	59		302								Yes.	63	No...?	60																				
60	60		301								Vera	Then why are you staring at me?	1																					
61	61		301								Vera	...Oh. I get it now. You were wondering about "me?"	1																					
62	62		301								Vera	Pfft, you sorry little fool. But, well...	1																					
63	63		301								Vera	If you want to know more...	1																					
64	64		301									Vera shuffles closer and whispers.																						
65	65		301								Vera	Come closer, shh, I'll tell you.	1																					
66	66		302								(Approach)	67	Okay?	67																				
67	67		301			RImgBg1Shake						You lean closer to Vera, only to be met with biting pain on your forehead.																						
68	68		302								Ow!	69																						
69	69		301									Ignoring your yelp, Vera curls her fingers and knocks you on the forehead once more. The force that she knocks you with almost sends you reeling. People call her a hyena for a reason.																						
70	70		204							1	13																							
71	71		301								Vera	Dimwit!	1																					
72	72		301									Vera scoffs, then crosses her arms again.																						
73	73		301								Vera	Stop sticking your nose into other people's business. Get it?	1																					
74	74		302								You viper.	75	Rude.	75																				
75	75		204							1	1																							
76	76		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Vera	Thanks. Now get out of my sight.	1
