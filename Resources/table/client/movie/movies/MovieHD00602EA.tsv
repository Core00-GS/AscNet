6	6		301								Celica	Yes? What is it?	2																					
7	7		301								Hassen	Do you still remember that... "School of Sapienism"?	1																					
8	8		301								Celica	... I don't know what you're talking about. If you're talking about things during the beginning of the Post-Pandemic Age, that's too far in the past for me.	2																					
9	9		301								Hassen	...I do recall them disappearing during the early Post-Pandemic Age.	1																					
10	10		301								Hassen	A school of more than a million people suddenly declared to the public, "Humanity is dead. We shall sail on this Ark, known as Earth, to the very end." right before they disappeared.	1																					
11	11		301								Celica	...Seems like they were just talking out their—	2																					
12	12		301								Hassen	Well, saying "humanity is dead" isn't that confounded.	1																					
13	13		204							2	2																							
14	14		301								Celica	...That doesn't sound like you.	2																					
15	15		301								Hassen	...No, I just find their sudden disappearance peculiar.	1																					
16	16		301								Hassen	I proposed this question to Nikola as well.	1																					
17	17		301								Hassen	They may have been an established organization during the Golden Age, but "Sapienism" was condemned as a doomsday cult for claiming that, "humanity's value is in memetics, not genetics."	1																					
18	18		301								Hassen	As a result, the World Government's intelligence agency rounded up the believers on the grounds of suspicious behavior toward the end of the Golden Age.	1																					
19	19		204							2	4																							
20	20		301								Celica	What happened? I never saw a report about that, which means...	2																					
21	21		301								Hassen	Correct, their operation didn't yield any meaningful results.	1																					
22	22		301								Hassen	Special forces raided 300 safe houses and rallies around the world, but not a single person was caught.	1																					
23	23		301								Hassen	Of course, when Nikola reported it afterward, he said they had already disappeared. Their declaration wasn't live. It was pre-recorded.	1																					
24	24		301								Hassen	And they really did... just completely disappear from the world stage.	1																					
25	25		301								Celica	So... you've never found any trace of them after that?	2																					
26	26		301								Hassen	No, they were gone without a trace—never to resurface.	1																					
27	27		301								Hassen	Shortly after, the Punishing Virus began to spread.	1																					
28	28		301								Hassen	The World Government had to quickly adapt to combating the Punishing Virus, so no one cared about the school.	1																					
29	29		301								Hassen	—Perhaps, even today...	1																					
30	30		301								Celica	...You mean...	2																					
31	31		301								Hassen	If it's really the "School of Sapienism" down there... After all these years, perhaps this will solve a small mystery.	1																					
32	32		301								Celica	What if they run into unforeseen danger in the facility?	2																					
33	33		301								Hassen	The Task Force is perfectly capable of evacuating if necessary.	1																					
34	34		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Hassen	As for any issues after that... That depends on the school's motive for fleeing underground.	1

53	52		301								Lucia	There were a lot fewer mechanoids here compared to the group that just left.	3																					
54	53		301								Lee	...If they were heading for where we came in, they should have been back by now.	2																					
55	54		301								Lee	So, they must've gone somewhere else...	2																					
56	55		301								Liv	The mechanoids are hostile to us, but they don't contain a high level of Punishing Virus. They aren't corrupted, just like the mechanoids we saw before.	1																					
57	56		301								Lucia	Is there any identifiable information? Model? Manufacturer? Serial number?	3																					
58	57		204							2	10																							
59	58		301								Lee	...No.	2																					
60	59		204							2																								
61	60		301								Lee	The only identifiable marking is the symbol hidden by their joints...	2																					
62	61		301								Lucia	...? Isn't this...	3																					
63	62		301								Lee	Ever since we came in here, this symbol has been on the cloth draped on the buildings and scattered throughout the facility.	2																					
64	63		301								Lee	So, all we can say is that this underground city has to correlate to the mechanoids.	2																					
65	64		204							2	10																							
66	65		301								Lee	...But this is plainly obvious at this point.	2
