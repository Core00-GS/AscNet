8	8		301				DialogDisable				Villier	A large number of troops have gathered outside the city, and there was riot in the North City District. It appears that they sympathize with the mutiny.	2

12	10		301								Qu	What do you mean?	1																					
13	11		301								Villier	We can leave Kowloong forever, freeing ourselves from family quarrels and human struggles.	2																					
14	12		301								Qu	You're right. Now's our chance...	1																					
15	13		301								Qu	But I won't leave Kowloong.	1																					
16	14		301								Villier	What do you mean?	2																					
17	15		301								Qu	You and I both know what will happen if Brother takes the throne. The mutiny will create a river of blood as they slaughter the citizens that support us.	1																					
18	16		301								Qu	We can't let him do that.	1																					
19	17		301								Villier	The citizens... Why can't you drop the act this time?	2																					
20	18		301								Villier	It's sickening. I thought you understood me.	2																					
21	19		301								Qu	I do understand. But I'm sorry, I was born to rule.	1																					
22	20		301								Qu	Protecting the citizens is my duty.	1																					
23	21		301								Villier	Hmph, do as you wish. I no longer concern myself with human affairs.	2																					
24	22		301								Villier	I wish to join the Science Council and work on their "Gestalt" AI technology.	2																					
25	23		301								Qu	Okay. I wish you all the best.	1

30	27		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						I do not know whether I made this decision out of everyone's expectation or out of my own free will.																						
31	28		301									But when I think about leaving Kowloong, a voice deep within my heart yells, "STOP!"																						
32	29		301									Because it's home to my comradesâ€”those that have what I lack. They are more perfect and beautiful than me.																						
33	30		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					So my duty is clear. I must protect them. I must protect the people of Kowloong.
