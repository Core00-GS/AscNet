8	6		301									Karenina was being shot by the arrows from a triggered trap. Kamui looked very concerned.																						
9	2003		201							1	1081001																							
10	7		301							1	Kamui	But you are stepping on a trap, no, many traps... Watch out!	1																					
11	8		301									Karenina ignored Kamui, who was trying to stop her, and continued walking forward. She triggered another trap just when Kamui stopped talking.																						
12	2004		401							2	1510																							
13	9		301									The ground quickly opened and Karenina was engulfed in flames, her HP kept dropping.																						
14	10		301			RImgBg1Shake						She then took out the recovery potions collected previously and sprayed them on herself.																						
15	11		301									This ultimate playstyle was so broken that it almost destroyed the game experience. It was invented by Camu, and soon adopted by Vera and Karenina.																						
16	2005		201							1	500173																							
17	12		301							1	Lee	I see... I never knew we could play this type of game like this.	1																					
18	2006		201							1	1081001																							
19	13		301							1	Kamui	Wait, this isn't the right way to play this game. It probably was Camu's idea!	1																					
20	14		301								Kamui	But I must say it again. This is the wrong way to play!	1																					
21	15		302								Camu said he thought of this idea while watching you play games.	16	What's the right way to play then?	17																				
22	16	1001	301								Kamui	But I never invented this method. I knew I was clumsy at certain games, but the fun of games comes from challenging the traps with skill.	1																					
23	17	1001	301								Kamui	To clear the traps with my wisdom and skill, of course!	1																					
24	1001		203							1	0.25	400																						
25	2007		201							2	500166	1	-400																					
26	18		301							1	Lucia	Do you mean detecting the traps, or avoiding them?	2																					
27	19		301								Kamui	Yeah, sort of.	1

30	2010		201							3	500173																							
31	20		301							1	Lee	That sounds good, but based on your usual performance, I doubt if you really can do it.	3

33	3002		201							1	500180																							
34	21		301							1	Karenina	Hey, what are you doing? Come over here!	1																					
35	22		301									While Kamui was still talking about his view on games, Karenina had already passed the corridor thanks to the recovery potions. She looked back and was shocked.																						
36	3003		201							1	1081001																							
37	23		301							1	Kamui	Hmph, I'll be there in a sec. Here I come!	1																					
38	3004		401							2	1501																							
39	24		301			RImgBg1Shake						The next second, Kamui triggered a trap that closed all the nearby exits.																						
40	25		301								Kamui	Huh? What's going on!?	1

44	26		301							1	Lucia	He triggered the trap within an instant...	1																					
45	27		301								Lee	I see. No wonder Camu invented that playstyle.	2																					
46	28		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Because Kamui could never detect, or avoid any traps.
