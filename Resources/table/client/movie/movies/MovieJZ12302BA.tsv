4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Roland	Ugh... I feel like I'm about to pass out.	1																					
5	5		202							1					1																			
6	6		301									Roland crashes onto the couch with a loud thud and lets out a relaxing sigh.																						
7	7		201							1	500365																							
8	8		301							1	Roland	Who's been writing the script recently? The new writer's completely missed Mandy's personality. Nothing ever goes as planned. It's always up to me to get the job done. What am I supposed to do if they really put him in danger?	1																					
9	9		301								Roland	Forget it. Not like complaining matters.	1																					
10	10		301								Roland	Contact my brother.	1																					
11	11		401							2	1515																							
12	12		301									Roland quietly commands the clock on the wall. Receiving the command, it lights up a timer.																						
13	13		301								Terminal	In order to ensure your sleep schedule, the duration of your call is limited to 11 minutes and 28 seconds.																						
14	14		401							2	714																							
15	15		301								Terminal	Connecting your call. Please wait...																						
16	16		301									The signal time beeps with each passing second on the timer. The rhythm is consistent, but he seems to sense a difference in the pitch, which reminds him of a weird experimental concert he went to with his family when he was younger.																						
17	17		301									Once the signal ends, there is a remote response.																						
18	18		401							2	887																							
19	19		301								Terminal	Apologies, the person you are trying to call is busy. Please try again later.																						
20	20		301								Roland	Redial.	1																					
21	21		401							2	887																							
22	22		301								Terminal	Apologies, the person you are trying to call is busy. Please try again later.																						
23	23		301								Roland	...Hmph. Guess today's a no-go, too, huh?	1																					
24	24		301									Scratching his head, Roland taps the comms again for the third time. At the same time, he swipes away the interface with the timer and presses another terminal interface.																						
25	25		301								Roland	Well, since I have to wait anyway, guess I'll see if there are any data reports on social media.	1																					
26	26		401							2	1515																							
27	27		301								Terminal	Request received. Analyzing data...																						
28	28		301									"The Mandhasti Real Park", a story about a person's life! Now as a sheriff, the protagonist fights for the peace of the whole city!																						
29	29		301									Enlarged on the holo-screen, the outrageous title and introduction seem to fly toward Roland. The data feed flowing under the title shows the achievements of the whole park. It seems that all of the crew enjoys the hard work they put in and its smashing success.																						
30	30		301								Roland	What a bunch of lies.	1																					
31	31		401							2	1515																							
32	32		301									Roland waves his hand, then pulls down the keyboard and taps a string of codes on the screen.																						
33	33		301								Roland	Bypass the firewall, cross the fiber terminal, and remove the big data selectivity tendency... Okay, we can finally see the real data flow. Good thing I took some time to learn a thing or two about coding.	1																					
34	34		301								Roland	Let's see what everyone really has to say online.	1																					
35	35		301									Right as Roland's hands stop, a string of unfiltered comments begin to appear on-screen.																						
36	36		301									"The Mandhasti Real Park" imitates a movie from ancient times by placing a human in the studio to film the birth, life, and death of the protagonist all within a studio set.																						
37	37		301									Some people hold this pioneer work in high esteem, thinking that such a real drama is the art of our times. Some people denounce this as a violation of human rights. Regarding this debate among viewers, it will likely ensue until the show finally comes to an end.																						
38	38		204							1	1																							
39	39		301								Roland	Seems like people really care for Mandy... Hah!	1																					
40	40		301								Roland	Looks like humans are really good at deceiving each other.	1																					
41	41		301									The vast sea of comments seems to show concern over the fate of Mandhasti. Whether they like it or not, the audience seems to regard his life as unique and genuine.																						
42	42		301									They don't know that behind his "unique" life, there are scripts written precisely down to the second. There are sets and cameras both camouflaged and hidden. All that they know is fake.																						
43	43		301								Roland	Hmph... How boring.	1																					
44	44		401							2	887																							
45	45		301								Terminal	Apologies, the person you are trying to call is busy. Please try again later.																						
46	46		301									As if in response to Roland's sigh, the robotic voice rings in his ear again, notifying him that no one had answered the call as the notice flashes on the holo-screen in front of him.																						
47	47		204							1	4																							
48	48		301								Roland	...Might as well try again.	1																					
49	49		202							1					1																			
50	50		401							2	1515																							
51	51		401							1	36																							
52	52		301									Facing the terminal, he gently taps "Redial" and stands up from the sofa.																						
53	53		401							1	207																							
54	54		301									He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. His eyelashes tremble. Opening his eyes, he smiles and slowly opens his mouth.																						
55	55		201							1	500365																							
56	56		301							1	Roland	When was the last time we spoke, little twerp?	1																					
57	57		301								Roland	You didn't answer my call last time. Or the time before that. Or the time before that either. Our schedules are so out of sync thanks to the production schedule. I don't know when to call you.	1																					
58	58		301								Roland	There's nothing special going on. Just wanted to catch up. How are our folks doing? Eat anything good recently? Go anywhere fun?	1																					
59	59		301								Roland	And how's the family dog?	1																					
60	60		301								Roland	Huh? We don't have a dog? But I'm lookin' at him right now!	1																					
61	61		301								Roland	Hahaha, what's wrong? You mad? Why don't we fight until it's night out for old time's sake?	1																					
62	62		301								Roland	â€”Obviously, that's impossible, bro. I'm busy. The project I'm working on is highly confidential and under wraps. Why else wouldn't I be able to go home? Even this call is limited.	1																					
63	63		301								Roland	But... There is a little somethin' I can show you.	1																					
64	64		301								Roland	Have I showed you my secret stash yet? Wanna take a peek at my terminal? You can find tons of secret things from the browsing records, which will open the door to a whole new world...	1																					
65	65		301								Roland	Huh? Why don't you wanna see it? Before that, a mechanoid idol was exposed to like watching vice clamps in action. Turns out he also frequented furnace and water pump factories. That sure got him a lot of attention.	1																					
66	66		301								Roland	But enough about that all that. I don't wanna bore you with that non-human crap. I just wanted to share something with you and talk to you.	1																					
67	67		301								Roland	Some time ago, you mentioned a social media platform in your voice message. I checked it over several times, but I didn't get any results. I guess it's shut down.	1																					
68	68		301								Roland	This place is so out of touch with the outside world. At least, it's just as wonderful and beautiful in here as it is out there. But this place is just... too unrealistic.	1																					
69	69		301									His mouth is parched, pausing for a moment, his fogy gaze looks down and then lifts up again.																						
70	70		301								Roland	...Hey, twerp. Time's running out. Keep this to yourself. Don't tell the folks. Just know that my current project... Well, it's not all that it's cracked up to be.	1																					
71	71		301								Roland	They're probably publicizing it outside as we speak. I'm in a show that's a true story about a man's life. It's the art of this era. But actually, there's more than meets the eye.	1																					
72	72		301								Roland	You might not know that it's all scripted, but it's completely fake. Any slip-up will cause the whole this to come crashing down. How could someone's reality be so fragile? After that, I'll get fired and sent home.	1																					
73	73		301								Roland	The sooner that day comes, the faster I get to see you all.	1																					
74	74		301								Roland	Then we can get our friends together and play some games we've never played. I heard a new game came out recently. When we're bored of that, we can fight like we used to. And after that, we can have some of Mom's dessert. When we're done with that, we can go to one of Dad's weird hipster concerts.	1																					
75	75		301								Roland	This acting gig will keep me fed for years. Afterward, I won't have to worry about getting work. When work dies down a bit, I'll come back home. Until then, I think it's worth the trouble of our folks sending me to acting school.	1																					
76	76		301								Roland	But I'm serious, twerp. I don't know how much longer I can stay in this fake world. I want to go home.	1																					
77	77		301								Roland	I'd give whatever it takes to go home to you, our folks, and my friends. Even if it costs me my life.	1																					
78	78		301								Roland	All I can do is keep telling myself to follow my dream. Only then can I feel alive... That dream is to be back with you all.	1																					
79	79		301									Roland keeps silent. The only response is the long, dull beeping of the clock indicating that it is time for him to rest. Just the sound is enough for Roland to begin to feel drowsy.																						
80	80		301								Roland	...Alright, that's enough. Cut communication.	1																					
81	81		301									He raises his hand to the comm interface floating in the air.																						
82	82		301									â€”The signal sound suddenly stops, but then the image of a teenager appears on the comm interface unexpectedly.

87	87		301							1	Roland	Rolmo...!	1																					
88	88		301								Rolmo	Bro! Bro! I finally got your call!	2																					
89	89		301								Rolmo	About time... I've missed you like crazy. I haven't seen you in forever. You just always call when everyone's away. We can't call because we're bound by contract. We've been worried.	2																					
90	90		301								Roland	Yeah, you're right. It's been a while...	1																					
91	91		301								Roland	Hey, Rolmo. I wanna keep talking with you, but I don't have much time. How are the folks?	1																					
92	92		301								Rolmo	Our folks? They're doing so well, it's annoying. They've been huddled around the TV and talking about you nonstop. When they saw you and that Mandhasti beat those criminals a few days ago, they were so happy that they started cheering and almost broke the sofa.	2																					
93	93		301								Rolmo	Didn't I tell you last time that they were always giving people your merch?	2																					
94	94		301								Rolmo	A few years ago, it was just relatives and colleagues. But now they're even giving it to their old classmates, so basically, the whole world knows you're in that TV show. Now our house is full of your merch, and I doubt they'd stop sending.	2																					
95	95		301								Rolmo	Let's be honest, you're their favorite. I'm super jealous. But that show of yours is great. Who wouldn't want to be your brother?	2																					
96	96		301								Rolmo	I've also bought a bunch of your merch. I gotta say, you've got one heck of a makeup artist. They sure have their work cut out for them making you look so good.	2																					
97	97		301								Roland	...Really? Mom and Dad like me that much...?	1																					
98	98		301								Roland	What about our family dâ€”	1																					
99	99		301									Roland suddenly stops himself mid-word.																						
100	100		301								Roland	â€”Er, I mean... How've you been?	1																					
101	101		301								Rolmo	Me? Well, I don't have a job like you. I'm broke.	2																					
102	102		301								Rolmo	Mom and Dad cut my allowance, and with all the merch I bought... This month, I spent all my money buying the latest "Jet Link Legends". Now I can't afford a copy of "Canal Wars". Everyone at school gets on right when class is over, so no one will me borrow a copy...	2																					
103	103		301								Rolmo	Speaking of... Hey, bro. Think you could spot me? I'll put in a good word with my classmates.	2																					
104	104		301								Rolmo	When they heard that my brother was an actor in that reality show, they all thought that I was rich and famous. Well, I'd be lying if I said I didn't like that.	2																					
105	105		301								Rolmo	So... Think you could do me a favor? Just like you said, I gotta keep up my "public image."	2																					
106	106		301								Roland	...Pff.	1																					
107	107		301								Rolmo	?	2																					
108	108		301								Roland	Hahaha! Looks like you still are a little twerp. Alright, alright... It's just a few bucks. I've got plenty to spare.	1																					
109	109		301								Roland	And I'm... relieved to see you so happy.	1																					
110	110		301								Roland	...It's nothing. Anyways, I don't have much more time to chat.	1																					
111	111		401							2	1515																							
112	112		301								Terminal	(Beeping) In order to ensure that you are mentally fit for the next show, please proceed to bed as soon as possible.																						
113	113		301									Following this, the terminal beeps once again.																						
114	114		301								Rolmo	You're out of time already? Mom and Dad said they wanted to send you some herbal tea to cheer you up a bit.	2																					
115	115		204							1	1																							
116	116		301								Roland	I'm fine. My daily caffeine intake is already about to give my nutritionist a heart attack.	1

120	120		202							1	2				1																			
121	121		301									Without another word, Roland terminates the call. The images of his family scatter, revealing a continuous flow of data.																						
122	122		301									As if afraid of being seen by his brother, Roland covers his face and takes a moment for his expression to return to normal.																						
123	123		301									After a while, he put down his hand, revealing a delightful smile.																						
124	124		201							1	500365																							
125	125		301							1	Roland	Haha... I can't believe my family actually watches me on TV so much.	1																					
126	126		301								Roland	The little twerp said that our folks are proud of me. He's even become popular among his friends because of it.	1																					
127	127		204							1	1																							
128	128		301								Roland	â€”Good, I'm glad. If they're this happy, then I should be, too.	1																					
129	129		202							1					1																			
130	130		301									Roland covers his mouth and lies down on the sofa, curling up and shaking. Like a hungry child who suddenly got a piece of candy, he is afraid of having this moment stolen from him. He has to find a place to hide, cover his mouth, savor the candy, and secretly enjoy it in his heart.																						
131	131		201							1	500365																							
132	132		301							1	Roland	Alright, I should practice a bit before I go to bed. Wouldn't want to disappoint them.	1																					
133	133		202							1					1																			
134	134		301									Rubbing his face, which is now sore from smiling, Roland turns around and grabs the holo-screen and continues reading where he left off.																						
135	135		301									Just like the comments and data from before, everyone who left a message on social media is concerned about the future of Mandhasti, as if they are somehow related to him.																						
136	136		301									What was all the fuss about? In the eyes of the fans, they thought the crew was working hard to give them a genuine adventure. Seems like no one suspected that it was just a part of the script and not just off the cuff. Not even Roland's family had guessed it.																						
137	137		201							1	500375																							
138	138		301							1	???	But isn't that because of you, Roland? Aren't you the one contributing to this facade?	1																					
139	139		201							1	500365	4																						
140	140		301							1	Roland	Thanks, Captain Obvious!	1																					
141	141		204							1																								
142	142		301								Roland	Analyze data on "Roland".	1																					
143	143		301									Roland shakes his head, deliberately ignoring the voice in his ear. Following his request, a series of data and keywords are densely arranged at the bottom of the screen. This time, it is about him.																						
144	144		301									Praise, envy, expectation and worry. The stream of comments, carrying countless emotions, washes toward Roland.																						
145	145		301									He scans their comments, quietly putting them to heart.																						
146	146		301								Roland	Mhm... Mhm... Seems like I've left quite the impression on the audience recently. Good. Very good.	1																					
147	147		301								Roland	Yeah, I normally don't wear a hair tie like this. I'll have to tell the stylist to keep it...	1																					
148	148		202							1					1																			
149	149		301									Roland strokes the small tuft of tied-up hair and smiles. In order not to be recognized as Roland onscreen after the performance, and in order to live peacefully with his family, he wants to shape the image of Roland to be different from his normal self off-screen.																						
150	150		301									Whatever is false should be labeled as such, and that which is true should remain true. The two must be distinguished from one another.																						
151	151		301									Otherwise, once confused, the two will be nearly inseparable.																						
152	152		301									This was the family's stipulation for letting him play Roland onscreen.																						
153	153		301									Yes, he can do whatever his family wants. He can use this method to continue holding on to his wish...																						
154	154		201							1	500365																							
155	155		301							1	Roland	(Yawn) I sure am exhausted today. I guess I'll call it quits for now. Time to get some sleep.	1																					
156	156		202							1					1																			
157	157		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Roland raises his hand to close the terminal, nestles into the sofa and falls asleep. According to the gatekeeper, he still has a few hours to sleep. Considering how much caffeine he needs to take in every day, these few hours are precious.

182	182		301									Scrap metal, shrapnel, scratches... Roland can even see a medical spray can with a hole punched in it on the ground spewing mist. Whatever happened, the sheriff had caused quite the scene.

199	199		301								Roland	Just because you were hallucinating, you think everything here is fake? No, that can't be the reason.	2																					
200	200		301								Roland	You mean to say I'm fake and lying to you? The same person who's been with you as we've put our lives in danger? Mandy?	2

204	204		301								Mandhasti	No matter how I fail, no matter the setback, I always seem to succeed in the end... Everything just feels like it's for show.	1																					
205	205		301								Mandhasti	It feels like everyone's trying to guard me and keep me on a set track. It even seems like I ended up here because someone else arranged it.	1																					
206	206		301								Mandhasti	And I saw... I saw, I saw Kay. When I went to find you with that gangster earlier, under that giant mechanoid...	1																					
207	207		301								Mandhasti	I'm scared... I have to confirm that the world I live in is real. So, I waited until I didn't have any other assignments and took a risk...	1																					
208	208		301								Roland	Kay... Our old partner. Mandy... I'm torn up about his death just as much as you are.	2																					
209	209		301								Roland	But... This isn't good. Missing someone this much and even imagining some giant mechanoid... That's crazy talk, Mandy!	2																					
210	210		202							1	2				1																			
211	211		301									Roland suddenly takes a step forward and grasps Mandhasti's wrist through the chain link fence.

214	214		301							1	Mandhasti	Ow! Roland?! That hurts...	1																					
215	215		301								Roland	That hurts? Good. That means you can feel pain. You can feel the warmth of my hand. That means you're a real person. Your feelings and experiences are all real. No one could possibly plan that.	2																					
216	216		301								Mandhasti	Rgh...	1																					
217	217		301								Roland	Promise me you'll get some rest, Mandy. I don't want to see you getting paranoid like this. Omi and the others will be devastated seeing you like this.	2																					
218	218		301								Roland	If you go on like this, I'm afraid... I'm afraid you'll have more hallucinations of others that have died... In the future, that might even include me.	2																					
219	219		301								Mandhasti	Roland... Are you crying?	1																					
220	220		301								Mandhasti	...I see. Thank you, Roland. I understand what I should do. I should hold on to those around me that are still aliveâ€”to you. Not phantoms of the past.	1																					
221	221		301								Roland	...That's right. Don't forget that. A lot of people still depend on you.	2																					
222	222		301								Roland	But this time, it's your turn to count on me. Trust me, I'll do everything I can to make sure you keep your position. Adios.	2																					
223	223		204							1	1																							
224	224		301								Mandhasti	Adios.	1

226	226		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Roland clenches a fist and clasps his left shoulder. Following a salute, the knight hurries away. Mandhasti seems to see Roland still crying as he runs out of the detention center.

236	236		301								Roland	Thank you. Happy to be of service. Call me any time for further proceedings.	1																					
237	237		301								Roland	How could they possibly let him see a dead character? I'm so busy with meetings and rewriting scripts. If I were a newcomer, I bet I'd just give up right on the spot.	1																					
238	238		301								Roland	The crew's been acting as extras long enough. How could they slip up like this? The makeup artist and prop team need to be held accountable. Guess we have to have another meeting with the new recruits.	1																					
239	239		301								Staff Member	No worries. We're professionals, and so are you. This won't be a problem.	2																					
240	240		301								Roland	Omi's up next. An experienced actress like herself really knows how to move the audience to tears. At least I won't have to be there tonight... Another scene like what happened just now, and people are going to have a fit on social media.	1																					
241	241		301								Staff Member	Yes, it's all arranged. Thank you for your hard work, but...	2																					
242	242		301								Roland	Yes, yes, I got it.	1

246	246		301									Before the worker can finish speaking, Roland quickly closes the terminal. Right as Roland's shoulders relax, a dizzy feeling crawls up his spine.																						
247	247		301									The sudden emergency interrupted his sleep. Including the temporary script and rehearsal, he has not slept for nearly 20 hours. His brain feels like a saturated sponge, unable to fully retain any new information.																						
248	248		301								Roland	But I can't rest yet. I have to review more.	1																					
249	249		401							2	726																							
250	250		301								Roland	Activate entrance security.	1																					
251	251		301								System	Activation complete.																						
252	252		202							1					1																			
253	253		301									The intricate clicking sound comes from within the old wall as the camera connects with the circuit. Then several footsteps come from the other side door as if someone sat down there.																						
254	254		301									It is a punch-in and alarm mechanoid, the newest model of security mechanoids and the latest version of that old security bot in the lounge. The room in which Roland currently finds himself is already guarded by a mechanoid dressed as a peasant. Even the crew has to go through an ordeal to enter the room.																						
255	255		301									Roland waves his hand, and an image appears out in front of him. It is a recording of the previous scene playing at different speeds.																						
256	256		301									Because of the uproar tonight, he received a notice from his superiors that all the actors must do their homework before Mandhasti makes any further abnormal behavior to avoid any accidents.																						
257	257		301									He picks a chair at random and looks at the screen silently.																						
258	258		301									The main character of the show is Mandhasti, who has lived his entire life onscreen. The plots over the past few years have had him endure a life of danger. In order to maintain the peace of the city, he has spared no effort to fight against the gangs, carrying the death of his former partner as he forges ahead.																						
259	259		201							1	500365	1																						
260	260		301							1	Roland	Heh, that sure is a flattering way of describing him.	1																					
261	261		301								Roland	If we were to have met somewhere else, maybe I...	1																					
262	262		202							1					1																			
263	263		301									Roland shakes his head and focuses his attention back on the screen.																						
264	264		301									The character, Roland, is Mandhasti's loyal assistant. He is a fearless desperado with an unyielding will. He often helps the protagonist in times of danger, much to the praise of fans.																						
265	265		301									"Roland", that is himâ€”but also not him. It is merely a shell that shares the same name. A shell that is admired by fans and wears a hair tie.																						
266	266		301									When he first entered the park, his parents had considered whether he should take a stage name, but he insisted on acting under his own name.																						
267	267		301									Today, that name has gradually developed into a stage name. If his performance continues to go smoothly, he might not even be able to separate the two identities one day.																						
268	268		301									But, of course, he has a way of distinguishing the two...																						
269	269		201							1	500365	4																						
270	270		301							1	Roland	(Yawn) Phew... I'm beat...	1																					
271	271		301									The images on screen seem to be lulling him to sleep. He can't shake the thought of sleep, and his vision begins to blur.																						
272	272		301								Roland	I need an espresso...	1																					
273	273		202							1					1																			
274	274		301									Roland gently waves his hand, causing an aluminum can to fall from the drink machine beside him. With a high dose of caffeine in a single sip, he should be good for several more hours.																						
275	275		301									He reaches out and tries to grab the can, but even though it is right next to him, it seems so far away.																						
276	276		201							1	500365	4																						
277	277		301							1	Roland	Gotcha...	1																					
278	278		301									But right as he is about to chug it...

281	281		301								Roland	Phew...																						
282	282		301									His hand falls to his side. His breathing is calm at first, but then gradually turns to quiet snoring.																						
283	283		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The caffeinated drink trickles onto the floor, reflecting the screen images that are still playing.

288	288		301							1	Roland	Huh? Looks like I passed out...	1																					
289	289		202							1					1																			
290	290		301									Roland rubs his eyes and looks up. On the screen, he sees Mandhasti and himself putting their lives at risk. Based on the scene, he probably didn't sleep much.																						
291	291		301									Then he realizes what woke him up. The shouting from the earpiece pounds on his eardrum like a sledgehammer.																						
292	292		301								Comms	Emergency... The lead...																						
293	293		301									He tries to listen to the message, but the message is muffled. He can only pick out a few key words.																						
294	294		201							1	500365	4																						
295	295		301							1	Roland	What...? Is something going on with Mandy again? Ugh, good grief. I'm on it. What's his position?	1																					
296	296		301								Comms	No!																						
297	297		301									Roland slowly lifts his arm and cuts the audio playback on the terminal. The screen gradually fades to black, leaving a blank screen.																						
298	298		301								Roland	Hello? Do you copy? Where is he? I need toâ€”	1																					
299	299		202							1					1
