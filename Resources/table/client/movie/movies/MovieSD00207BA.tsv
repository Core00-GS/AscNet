5	5		301							1	Hassen	Celica, I heard the preparation of the Christmas Eve gala is coming along smoothly?	1																					
6	6		301								Celica	It is, but the number of squads available to attend that day is...	2																					
7	7		301								Hassen	Well, times like this... We still have to make a proper showing even if we aren't getting as many attendees. Let those who'll be there enjoy themselves to the fullest.	1																					
8	8		301								Celica	Absolutely.	2

14	14		301							1	Hassen	Huh?	1																					
15	15		301								Celica	Huh?	2																					
16	16		301									Ayla barges in out of nowhere with a camera after Hassen's and Celica's conversation.																						
17	17		301									She smiles at the camera before turning it toward the two of them.

20	20		301							1	Ayla	Now, if I can have a word from the two of you. I said "a word," but it's just a figure of speech. I'm really hoping you'll at least say a sentence, or preferably a paragraph.	1																					
21	21		201							1	500011																							
22	22		301							1	Hassen	Hold on, Ayla, what are you doing? What's with the camera?	1																					
23	23		201							1	500110																							
24	24		301							1	Ayla	Did neither of you open the message I forwarded to you? Look, here it is.	1																					
25	25		301									Ayla takes out her comms device from her bag and shows them.

28	28		301							1	Celica	...Whoa, that's interesting!	2																					
29	29		301								Hassen	It's a good idea indeed, not to mention a unique medium. Celica, see if we can arrange some satellites with surplus capacity later.	1																					
30	30		301								Celica	Yes, sir!	2

32	32		201							1	500110																							
33	33		301							1	Ayla	You can discuss that afterward. What's important right now is the camera in your face!	1																					
34	34		201							1	500011																							
35	35		301							1	Hassen	You're right. But this is so sudden, I'm not sure where to begin...	1																					
36	36		201							1	500110	1																						
37	37		301							1	Ayla	Then we'll have Asimov start first.	1

39	39		301							1	Hassen	Asimov, you've been here the whole time?	1

41	41		301							1	Asimov	I... was grabbed when I got here. What farce are you up to this time?	1

44	44		301							1	Ayla	It's not a farce, it's a small entertainment event! Can I get you to say something for the camera, please?	2																					
45	45		301								Asimov	...Do you always say "please" while clutching others' sleeves?	1																					
46	46		301								Asimov	You know what... That's fine.	1																					
47	47		301								Ayla	Then we'll start with you!	2																					
48	48		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Asimov	Sigh, well...	1
