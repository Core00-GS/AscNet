5	5		301									When you finally wake, you start at the sight of Lucia sitting in the corner of your quarters, calm as a lotus flower.																						
6	6		301								Lucia	Commandant, you're finally awake.	1																					
7	101		204							1	6																							
8	7		301								Lucia	First... I must offer you my apologies.	1																					
9	8		302								Why are you apologizing?	9	It's okay.	10																				
10	9	11	301								Lucia	For the... "failed experiments" I made you eat. I should have known that there was more to food than its appearance.	1																					
11	10	11	301								Lucia	Thank you, Commandant. I knew you would not hold it against me.	1																					
12	11		301								Lucia	Please don't take this the wrong way, but... watching you faint made me realize a great many things about myself.	1																					
13	12		301								Lucia	Not just the old me, but the new me, as well.	1																					
14	102		302								The new you?	13	Have you processed all your memories?	14																				
15	13	15	301								Lucia	I had my doubts, but they won't be a problem anymore.	1																					
16	14	15	301								Lucia	Not all of it, but the rest won't be a problem.	1																					
17	15		301								Lucia	A lot of people have been turning up, looking for you for various reasons, Commandant. But I sent them all away.	1																					
18	103		302								Nothing important, I hope?	16	Why didn't you wake me?	17																				
19	16	18	301								Lucia	Some important, some less so. But I took care of them all promptly.	1																					
20	17	18	301								Lucia	Because the exhaustion must be piling up for you, what with our recent missions and... incidents. I took the liberty of safeguarding your rest.	1																					
21	18		301								Lucia	There are no missions scheduled today, so you can rest easy. I will take watch.	1																					
22	104		302								Kind of hard to fall asleep with someone watching.	19	Shouldn't you go get some rest too?	20																				
23	19	21	301								Lucia	Is that so... I can turn awayâ€”I guess that wouldn't help any.	1																					
24	20	21	301								Lucia	Taking watch is rest enough for me, Commandant.	1																					
25	105		204							1	1																							
26	21		301								Lucia	What's with that expression...? We've been together like this for long, Commandant, even if I wasn't always privy to your condition...	1																					
27	22		301								Lucia	According to the records, you were the one person whom I have been with the longest. I am simply adhering to my past behavior.	1																					
28	23		301								Lucia	So... in short.	1																					
29	106		204							1	6																							
30	24		301								Lucia	I would like to share our time together, Commandant.	1																					
31	107		302								Whoa...	25	If that's what you'd like...	25																				
32	25		301								Lucia	No, please don't answer. I did not express my feelings to elicit a reply.	1																					
33	26		301									As she speaks, Lucia presents you with a paper crane. It's been carefully folded countless times, and you can faintly make out scribbles in between the creases.																						
34	27		301									From the scribbles, you make out a set of groundside coordinates, close to the new HQ you set up together, and these words: "I hope that you'll be there, at the appointed time."																						
35	28		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Simply put... I'm asking you out on a date.	1
