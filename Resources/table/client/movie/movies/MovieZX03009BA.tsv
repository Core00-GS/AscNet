57	57		301									Liv knows the significance of new specialized frames more than anyone. It was a risky bet, and she was only one step away from destruction. If everything goes all over again, she could have lost everything.																						
58	58		301								Liv	Maybe one day... Not just Lee and myself, other Constructs are also able to use new specialized frames... I'm sure Commandant will become their most important assistance.	2																					
59	59		301									Lee looks into Liv's eyes and nods. He understands what she was trying to say... Liv and he might not be able to successfully change into specialized frames, and failure often leads to death. Commandant will have to bear the future of mankind in that case.

71	71		301								Celica	But the only Scarab member in Babylonia is Yata... She is currently in an event with Harley Jo, her temporary commandant.	2

94	94		301									Nikola turns on the tactical projector. It displays all sorts of information near Copperfield Aquarium. The vast amount of crimson dots represent enemies.																						
95	95		301								Nikola	A high number of Hetero-Creatures have gathered around the Red Tide that has entered the bottom of the sea... They aren't as widespread as the last time, but have a higher concentration.	1

100	100		301								Karenina	If that's the case, we can't easily break through even if we have the latest shuttle engine... Are you implying we must detour?	2																					
101	101		301								Teddy	According to a report sent by the Gray Raven Commandant, a large humanoid Hetero-Creature seemed to have appeared in the central area, with a large quantity of Hetero-Creatures spawning around it... I don't think it will be feasible to take the land route either.	1																					
102	102		204							1	13																							
103	103		301								Teddy	Still, I have to give you credit for coming up with an idea other than direct confrontation. Well done.	1

122	122		204							1																								
123	123		301								Lee	If we enter from this airspace, we can fully utilize the acceleration power of the new engine to lose most of the flying Hetero-Creatures. Then we can reach this ground location that is relatively closer to where the Red Tide enters the sea.	1																					
124	124		301								Lee	Here, can you see? There's a valley that connects to the entrance to the sea directly... Humans will probably set up an ambush, but Hetero-Creatures don't have that thought. In here, we can avoid engaging a large number of Hetero-Creatures in open space...	1

146	146		301							1	Teddy	Now the question is whether we can find enough breakthrough forces. They better have real combat experience... We really are short of hands now.	1																					
147	147		301								Karenina	Rosetta is in the Engineering Force at the moment. She also wants to be part of the operation. Count her in.	2
