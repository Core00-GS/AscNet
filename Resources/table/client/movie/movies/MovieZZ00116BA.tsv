47	46		302								Ann...	47																						
48	47		301								Ann	I'm afraid you'll forget all of this when you wake up, since your consciousness was forced in here.	1

58	57		301								Nikola	What about "Virtual Horizon"?	1																					
59	58		301								Asimov	Rosetta and I checked again, and no abnormalities were found. That strange data noise hasn't appeared ever since.	2																					
60	59		301								Nikola	So, looks you guys were worried about nothing.	1																					
61	60		301								Asimov	Maybe, but according to the commandant, the sudden slumber came right after the experiment, which is not normal.	2																					
62	61		301								Asimov	I highly advise putting a stop to further testing until we uncover the truth behind the matter.	2
