30	30		301								Noan	Was he out on the mission with you guys?	1																					
31	31		301								Bancroft	No, he wasn't. I kept my eye out for the goods the entire way because they cost an arm and a leg, and I didn't see him around.	2																					
32	32		301								Noan	Is it possible... that he was hiding among the goods?	1																					
33	33		301								Bancroft	We went through all the boxes already.	2																					
34	34		301								Noan	When did you do that?	1																					
35	35		301								Bancroft	We did it once before to minimize our stopover before we arrived at the station, and then a second time when we were delivering the goods.	2																					
36	36		301								Bancroft	...Wait.	2																					
37	37		301								Bancroft	Is it possible that he went missing right after the first time you went through the goods?	2																					
38	38		301								Bancroft	No way, because we ran a quick check over the goods once halfway through the mission.	2																					
39	39		301								Noan	A quick check, you said?	1																					
40	40		301								Bancroft	Right, because a few of our transport vehicles toppled over when we ran into some Corrupted on the way.	2																					
41	41		301								Bancroft	I mean, we did spend some time going around the place without the goods to divert their attention, but we didn't pick up on any abnormalities when we got back.	2																					
42	42		301								Noan	Did you lose anything this time?	1																					
43	43		301								Bancroft	No. We totally thought someone had their eye on this particular batch of goods because they were such gems, but we didn't really lose anything besides the few things that got damaged from the attack.	2

56	56		301									Noan hands the thread he found over to Bancroft.																						
57	57		301								Noan	I found it in one of the ventilation ducts, but I can't be sure if this is something that came off his scarf.	1

59	59		301								Bancroft	The texture and the smell of it... Yes, it's gotta be the scarf he wears that he got from my wife. I'm 100% sure.	2

82	82		301								Bancroft	But we didn't lose anything this time!	2																					
83	83		301								Assad	My, you sure you didn't leave your boy in City 074 for him to do the stealing for you?	1																					
84	84		301								Bancroft	Are you out of your mind?! I didn't even have time to see him because of this stupid long route you said you were going to take!	2																					
85	85		301									Assad smirks.																						
86	86		301								Assad	Oh, yes, we did take the long route—but so what? Are you gonna snitch to one of the "dickheads" now to get your little boy his meds?	1																					
87	87		301								Bancroft	W-why would I do that?!	2																					
88	88		301								Bancroft	How did he know my goods were in G54 anyways? Oh, I see. You told him my goods were there!	2																					
89	89		301								Assad	You should bring that question to your son because you're not going to believe what I say either way. But let's see—if he's not on the train, then he's gotta be in City 074 with all the goods, then.	1																					
90	90		301								Assad	Or are you just going to leave him there to die because he's such a burden?	1

115	115		301								Noan	Can I go with you, then?	1

339	339		301								Roland	But the kid has trouble controlling himself sometimes, and he's just so set on humans or the Constructs that failed the filtering.	1

344	344		301								Vonnegut	And his vision of the new world isn't different from mine—those that fail to pass the filtering might as well make themselves useful by being the Red Tide's food.	2																					
345	345		301								Vonnegut	He believes that they'll be sleeping happily ever after in the Red Tide because the Red Tide will literally have dissolved all their pains from when they were still alive.	2																					
346	346		301								Vonnegut	Which is why he loves the world in the Red Tide with all his heart as much as he does those twisted shards, and I have no reason to wake him up from his dream no matter what they really are.	2																					
347	347		301								Roland	Spoiling your kids never does them good.	1

349	349		301								Vonnegut	If you don't want to become one of my Ascendants, then all the work you do here and the information you receive are nothing more than a trade.	2																					
350	350		301								Vonnegut	You already have what it takes to stand in the new world—and as long as you steer clear of the filtering, you can go anywhere you want and I won't stop you.	2																					
351	351		301								Roland	You won't stop me, but you're still going to keep an eye on me.	1																					
352	352		301								Vonnegut	That's only appropriate. You're not one of us yet, after all.	2
