3	3		301			DialogEnable						From then on, Liv joins the others in "Operation Christmas".																						
4	4		301									What started off as an effort to cheer up Liv, is now a team effort to create their very first Christmas together.																						
5	5		301									Their temporary base is an ordinary abandoned building located in the northern region of what was once Russia.																						
6	6		301									After the Punishing Virus swept the Earth, the land had been long since abandoned. Collapsed ruins, overgrowth, and dilapidated facilities spread throughout the barren wasteland.																						
7	7		301									But after considerable effort, this abandoned structure had been transformed into a warm abode.																						
8	8		301									It's now filled with the group's merry cheers.

39	39		302								Lee?	40	What's wrong?	40																				
40	40		301								Lee	Now that we've finished decorating the place, it really feels like Christmas in here. But feels like something is missing...	2

42	42		301							1	Liv	Oh, I know! I'm missing a little "something."	2																					
43	43		301								Liv	We can't just quietly go to bed on Christmas Eve. Just enjoying the starry night sky isn't enough.	2																					
44	44		301								Liv	We should have a firework show for it to be a festival of excitement and joy. Right?	2																					
45	45		301								Nanami	Fireworks? I love fireworks!	1																					
46	46		301								Liv	But that's easier said than done... Fireworks aren't easy to come by in a place like this. Any ideas?	2

48	48		301							1	Lucia	Liv.	1

53	53		301								Lucia	Not just fireworks, but also the Christmas Even bell. We've thought of everything.	1																					
54	54		301								Liv	Christmas Eve bell?! B-but how are you going to do that?	2																					
55	55		201							1	1011001		400																					
56	56		301							1	Lee	I took a detour and went exploring while we were on the mission. There's an old clock tower in a town nearby.	1																					
57	57		301								Lee	It's the tallest building in the town. If someone goes up and rings it, I bet everyone within a ten-kilometer radius could hear it.	1																					
58	58		301								Lee	It's also the best place to light fireworks. Without any trees to block our view, we've got the best seats in the house to watch the fireworks.	1

60	60		301								Liv	Isn't the road dangerous, though? I'm already at my limits...	2

62	62		301							1	Lucia	...Yes, that's why I'm worried. We haven't received any news on the transmitter yet. And when we try to use it, the signal's too unstable.	1
