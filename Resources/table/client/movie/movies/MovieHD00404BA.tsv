6	6		301								Diana	But since you said you are going to New Murmansk up north, I've brought you here to our temporary camp.	1

23	23		301							1	Lee	Well, if I'm not mistaken, they're outfitted with a rare offshoot of Construct tech—they're humanoid hybrid Constructs.	1

25	25		301							1	Liv	Humanoid hybrids... Constructs are created with human consciousness. If the bodies are not entirely human, then their consciousness would be...	1																					
26	26		201							1	1011001	10

47	47		201							1	1011001																							
48	48		301							1	Lee	After all, this is a high latitude area, which normally means lower Punishing Virus concentration and, therefore, fewer Corrupted.	1

66	66		301									Even Lee, who normally would throw in a comment at times like this, is just quietly sipping his tea.																						
67	67		301								Lucia	No matter how cruel the battles are on Earth...																						
68	68		301								Lucia	The mountains, the rivers, and the sky above us... They never seem to be affected...																						
69	69		301								Liv	Earth... is so beautiful...
