8	8		301							1	Luna	Yes. About our plans...	2																					
9	9		301								Roland	Is this about "her?" If so, you need not worry. She is an easy find.	1																					
10	10		301								Luna	You know that I'm not directing you to "find" her.	2																					
11	11		301								Luna	But instead, I need you to remind her of her duty as an agent of the network. Don't "save" people to her own whims.	2																					
12	12		301								Luna	I patched up and upgraded your frame, not to have you play detective for a massive light bulb.	2																					
13	13		301								Roland	Miss Luna... You truly expect her to listen to me?	1																					
14	14		301								Roland	You must know that she is not one that easily sways.	1																					
15	15		301								Luna	As long as it serves to warn her.	2																					
16	16		301								Roland	But with me, Miss Luna? I'm afraid a person of your stature might be required for her to listen.	1																					
17	17		301								Luna	...	2																					
18	18		301								Roland	Or, pardon my forthrightness, Miss Luna... Are you apprehensive of being beguiled by her?	1																					
19	19		301								Roland	Surely, you know what that entails.	1																					
20	20		301								Luna	Silence.	2																					
21	21		301								Roland	Disregarding one's duties as an agent, with no heed to the aptitude of the target, "saving" people with the power of Asc-net to one's whims...	1																					
22	22		301								Roland	Such an existence is an intolerable betrayal to the network itself.	1																					
23	23		301								Luna	You heard me‚ÄîSilence.	2																					
24	24		301								Roland	...My apologies.	1																					
25	25		301								Roland	But, please, Miss Luna. Do reconsider...	1

36	36		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Gabriel	You should not have met Miss Luna with such impudence.	1																					
37	37		301							1	Roland	Well, Gabriel. Even if I'd stayed mute, "her" issue won't magically solve itself.	2																					
38	38		301								Roland	We've already had a taste of the new Ascendants she gave life to.	2																					
39	39		301								Roland	Just that Qu alone had us mobilize an entire region of Corrupted to deal with her.	2																					
40	40		301								Gabriel	But, we succeeded in the end.	1																					
41	41		301								Roland	And the price?	2																					
42	42		301								Roland	All of us Ascendants were put on the line, and the several hundred thousands of Corrupted lost...	2																					
43	43		301								Gabriel	Worth.	1																					
44	44		301								Roland	Tch. You are such a derriere sometimes, Gabriel.	2																					
45	45		301								Roland	"Worth"? What do you mean worth? Are we going all-in on every single faction in this world?	2																					
46	46		301								Roland	And our enemies aren't just target dummies‚Äîthey learn. After a war of such magnitude, they will develop plans to counter us.	2																					
47	47		301								Gabriel	...	1																					
48	48		301								Roland	...Don't forget, Gabriel. In the end, we only have so few of us.	2																					
49	49		301								Gabriel	We only require victors who can live through the "filter."	1																					
50	50		301								Roland	A land of only "victors"... I've heard this spiel more than a thousand times.	2																					
51	51		301								Roland	Not everyone is like you, Gabriel.	2																					
52	52		301								Gabriel	So what?	1																					
53	53		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	...Yeah, I guess. "So what?"	2

59	60		301									Alpha does a cut-throat gesture with her thumb.																						
60	61		301								Œ±	Should I?	2																					
61	62		301								Luna	...He's the least of our worries.	1																					
62	63		301								Œ±	So, "her?"	2																					
63	64		301								Luna	At the very least, what Roland said was right.	1																					
64	65		301								Luna	"She" is not one to listen.	1																					
65	66		301								Œ±	Then...	2																					
66	67		301								Luna	She will have to realize‚Äîthat these "randomly saved" people will have no future to speak of.	1																					
67	68		301								Luna	Something the scale of Kowloong though... That's out of the equation for now.	1																					
68	69		301								Luna	But, if it's to make an example... I'll still gladly do it.	1																					
69	70		301								Œ±	Got it. I'll get moving.	2																					
70	71		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Luna	...Thanks.	1
