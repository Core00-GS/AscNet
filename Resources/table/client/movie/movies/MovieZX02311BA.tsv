4	4		301									Along the journey, she remains silent. The voices of self-doubts overwhelm her mind. It isn't until she meets up with her companions that she finally picks herself up.																						
5	5		301									Upon returning to Conservation Area 046, Liv gives the bloodstained note back to its owner.																						
6	6		301									The boy has found his brother among the armed refugees. Holding the note in his arms, he starts crying.

12	12		301									The lives she couldn't save are like the sand in an hourglass, falling down to the bottom as every second passes.																						
13	13		301									Even when she does catch a grain of sand, it will eventually meet the same tragic fate, just like Matches...																						
14	14		301									...Just like how Stanley didn't want Fantine to have a child. No one can change this world. Even survival is just extending the pain.

17	17		301									At the thought of the unconscious commandant, Liv starts to get overwhelmed by grief and despair.

90	90		301									Gray Raven hasn't returned to Conservation Area 046. To search for supplies and get prepared for her delivery, Fantine gives a heads-up to the Constructs stationed in this conservation area and leaves with Jonny and the others.																						
91	91		301									Protected by her companions, she manages to collect all the required supplies earlier than she expects. Being pregnant, she cannot move around too much, so she sits on the bench in the mall square, waiting.																						
92	92		301									Looking at the setting sun, she rubs her hand against the blanket she just found and checks the supplies she will need when she delivers her child.																						
93	93		201							1	500393	14																						
94	94		301							1	Fantine	Yeah. Everything is here.	1																					
95	95		301									She looks up into the distance and thinks about the future of her child as she waits for her companions to return.																						
96	96		301								Fantine	I don't know if it's a good idea... to bring you into this world.	1																					
97	97		301									She thinks about the harsh, cruel world and ponders the question.																						
98	98		301								Fantine	If only you could answer that question for me... my child, that'd be nice.	1																					
99	99		301									Before meeting Stanley, someone had asked her the same question. Back then, she didn't hesitate to give a positive answer.																						
100	100		301									Fantine grew up in an environment where she was constantly hungry and on the run, but even so, she considered herself a happy, lucky girl.																						
101	101		301									She was loved by her family and her husband. And she wanted to share that feeling with her child.																						
102	102		301									The two of them had planned out a future for their baby and worked very hard to make it happen.																						
103	103		301									She remembers how she and her husband were crying tears of joy when they heard the news that they could stay in the conservation area.																						
104	104		301									But everything came crumbling down after that disaster in the Pulia Forest Park Ruins. Those who once loved her so much are now nothing but memories of the past.																						
105	105		301									If things get worse, she won't even be able to protect herself, let alone her child.																						
106	106		301									Is it really a good idea to bring our child into this world?																						
107	107		301									She has lost count of how many times she ponders this question after that conversation with Stanley.																						
108	108		301								Fantine	Everyone is gone... And there's no home for me to go back to.	1																					
109	109		301								Fantine	If I lose this child as well...	1																					
110	110		301									Tears start rolling in her eyes as Fantine thinks about the possibility that she has to live her life alone.																						
111	111		301									Love goes both ways. She wants to love her child and be loved back.																						
112	112		301								Fantine	...It's like I'm doing this for my own good.	1																					
113	113		301									It is a selfish act to bring a new life into this cruel world just to not feel lonely and feel loved. That is not fair for this child.																						
114	114		301								Fantine	But...	1																					
115	115		301									How can we know for sure that this child will hate this world?																						
116	116		301									Short and eventful as it is, her 27 years of life are beautiful thanks to her loved ones and especially, her parents.																						
117	117		301								Fantine	No one knows what the future holds...	1																					
118	118		301									So, who should make this decision?																						
119	119		301									As Fantine is thinking, a somewhat familiar voice comes from the corner of the alley.																						
120	120		301								??	Run... Now...																						
121	121		301									She looks toward where the raspy voice comes from and sees a staggering Hetero-Sapien.

126	126		301									Fortunately, its sound has caught Fantine's attention and she runs away before it is too late.																						
127	127		301								Fantine	H... help...	1																					
128	128		301									She has read a lot of books and knows that running at 39 weeks of pregnancy could lead to early labor. She is not ready for seeing the baby yet, but at the moment, she has no choice but to run as fast as she can while holding her belly.

147	147		301									Ten hours? Or more? Fantine has no idea.																						
148	148		301									All she knows is that the moon has risen and the sun has set, concealing the blood stains on the road.																						
149	149		301									The child in her arms, who should have been born in a clean room, slipped into this world unprepared and landed in the mud.																						
150	150		301								Fantine	...Hello there... little one...																						
151	151		301								Fantine	It's a girl...																						
152	152		301									Warm blood keeps flowing out from her body and she feels colder and colder from the loss of blood. She doesn't have to know what is going on exactly. She can tell.																						
153	153		301									There is no time to lose. Fantine trembles as she picks up the baby covered in blood and swaddles her in a soft blanket.																						
154	154		301								Fantine	...Sorry, we have no choice...																						
155	155		301									She struggles to reach out her hands to the most vulnerable part of the baby.																						
156	156		301									The baby's neck is so soft and so delicate...																						
157	157		301									Strangle it and this little life, who has not yet seen the world, will have a quick and painless death.																						
158	158		301									This little life will not have to wait in the long cold night for help, nor will she have to face the terrible unknown.																						
159	159		301								Fantine	But... it shouldn't be like this...																						
160	160		301									She knows that children come into the world through their parents, not from them.																						
161	161		301									You can give love to a child, but not ideas.																						
162	162		301									The parent is the bow and the child is the arrow of life that comes from the bowstring.																						
163	163		301									This "bow" woman has long since understood her role, but still, she is determined to destroy her "arrow."																						
164	164		301								Fantine	I have to make this choice for you, sweetie... You hate Mommy, right? Sorry...																						
165	165		301									—Is it because she regrets her decision back then?																						
166	166		301									Does she regret meeting her husband and conceiving this little life?																						
167	167		301									Would she have lived a safe life if she hadn't been pregnant?																						
168	168		301								Fantine	Maybe...																						
169	169		301								Fantine	But I wouldn't have been as happy as I am now.																						
170	170		301									—Are you really happy?																						
171	171		301									The first answer that comes to Fantine's mind is neither yes nor no.																						
172	172		301									Before she can say anything, her hands betray her in a tremor and pat the baby instead.																						
173	173		301									As if knowing her mother's grief, the baby responds with loud cries, announcing the arrival of a new life.																						
174	174		301								Fantine	I'm such a cowardly and selfish mother...																						
175	175		301								Fantine	Having you in this world is neither my happiness nor my torment... but my... longing.																						
176	176		301									The nearer death draws, the more she cannot part with this little life.																						
177	177		301									In the cold moonlight, Fantine huddles in despair and makes a prayer to a being she has never believed in before.																						
178	178		301								Fantine	...Please save this child... Let her live...																						
179	179		301								Fantine	Please give her enough time to choose wisely...

185	185		301									Liv carries a lot of medical supplies with her.																						
186	186		301									She had thought about the situation of blood loss, but she shouted in the crowd and no one answered. So she had to come on her own to help.																						
187	187		301								Liv	...We can't do a blood transfusion now... And even if I can stop the bleeding...																						
188	188		301								Fantine	...Thank you, Liv.																						
189	189		301									Liv doesn't want to hear thank you in this situation.																						
190	190		301								Liv	No... I haven't done anything yet...																						
191	191		301								Fantine	Then... can I ask you for one thing?																						
192	192		301								Liv	Yes, I'm listening...																						
193	193		301								Fantine	Take my baby away... Please let her live...																						
194	194		301								Fantine	Help her grow up and make sure she can think for herself and make her own decision...																						
195	195		301									Liv looks at the baby in her arms once more. It is a miracle that this little girl is alive and kicking. Only after she is certain that her promise is not an empty one does Liv nod to Fantine.																						
196	196		301								Liv	...No problem.																						
197	197		301								Fantine	...Thank you, Liv.																						
198	198		301									The dying Fantine breathes a sigh of relief with a smile on her pale face.																						
199	199		301								Fantine	When she grows up, please tell her... Mommy and Daddy... brought her into the world...																						
200	200		301								Fantine	Because... we thought this world was... as beautiful as it was turbulent...																						
201	201		301								Fantine	We would love to tell her about it ourselves... but we can't...																						
202	202		301								Fantine	We're useless... Sorry...

204	204		301								Fantine	So...																						
205	205		301								Fantine	If in the future, she... tries her best to get what she wants... but still hates the world...																						
206	206		301								Fantine	Tell her to go find Mommy and Daddy...																						
207	207		301								Liv	Fantine...																						
208	208		301								Fantine	It's okay... Life is not supposed to be a bondage, but a force for good...																						
209	209		301								Fantine	The choice is hers...																						
210	210		301								Fantine	I want to name her Cosette... What do you think?																						
211	211		301								Liv	...Cosette... It's a beautiful name.

215	215		301								Fantine	Now... I see her... But... I won't be there for her anymore...																						
216	216		301									Fantine closes her eyes slowly. Her smile does not fade with her life, as if she is still repeating her last words to Liv.																						
217	217		301									—I don't regret giving birth to my baby girl.																						
218	218		301								Liv	Do you also not regret dying...																						
219	219		301								Liv	Why...																						
220	220		301									The boy's answer was written on paper—he wanted to help others.

235	235		301									Embracing the "death" of oneself and others is the true meaning of life, Liv thinks.																						
236	236		301									Death gives life from one being to another being, to birds, beasts, insects, and flowers.																						
237	237		301									And those lives, in turn, will give their lives to others through death.
