3	3		301								Narration	It is a rainy night. The city looks like a wet castle made from mud under the street lamp's yellow light.																						
4	4		301								Narration	You are standing in a deserted graveyard located on the outskirts of this damningly corrupted city.																						
5	5		301								Narration	You are standing around the most unremarkable grave stone, waiting with your hands together.

10	3445		301								Kamui	Why is he still following us?	3																					
11	3446		301								Lee	Look, there's something written on his body...	1																					
12	3447		301								Liv	"This camp assistant is specifically designed for students who are not combat trained, so they could focus on experiencing the story"...?	2																					
13	3448		301								Everyone	...	1	2	3																			
14	3449		301								Lee	So...	1																					
15	9		301								Lee	What are we waiting for?	1

17	10		301							1	Lucia	Why is the city corrupt?	2																					
18	11		301								Kamui	What does he mean by "hands together"?	3																					
19	12		301									The narrator never answers, as if he does not care at all.																						
20	13		301									It is only then that the Constructs realize they are floating half a meter above the ground. They cannot move.																						
21	14		201							2	1031001																							
22	15		301							1	Liv	We can't move... This is a completely unknown technology...	2																					
23	16		301								Lee	It is capable of cutting the link between us and reality to create this effect on the consciousness level. When we are out, I must break this record apart to study it...	1																					
24	17		301								Narration	Anyway, you are all waiting.																						
25	18		301								Narration	Waiting for your master to wake up...

27	20		301							1	Ayla	Master...?	2																					
28	21		301								Kamui	Wait... Has anyone of you seen Commandant?	3

33	26		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Narration	Meanwhile, you are lying inside a dark, wet, and putrid coffin.																						
34	27		301								Narration	Rainwater falls into your mouth through soil and two layers of rotten wood. It tastes so foul that you would definitely vomit if you could move.																						
35	28		302								Where am I?	29	Why is this happening to me?	30																				
36	29	31	301								Narration	Inside a coffin. You're dead... for now.																						
37	30		301								Narration	Oh, you were murdered by the local gang as you messed with their business.																						
38	31		301								Narration	But it won't last too long. Your eyes are wide open, and your blood has started to flow again, slow like petroleum.																						
39	32		301								Narration	Your muscles are getting strong. You feel your body is returning back to your control.																						
40	33		302								(Push the coffin open)	34	(Keep waiting)	36																				
41	34		301								Narration	Oh, no. Please, just be a little more patient. You are obviously not in your best form yet.																						
42	35		301								Narration	Your effort was wasted. You only managed to move the lid slightly. Some foil falls on your face.																						
43	36		301								Narration	You continue to wait, until your muscles return to their power. Now you have enough strength.																						
44	37		302								(Push the coffin open)	38																						
45	38		301									You push with all your strength. The lid makes a disturbing squeak between your hands and the soil covering it.																						
46	39		301									And then you see lightâ€”the dim, yellow light from the street lamps shines right on your face.																						
47	40		301									The Constructs are floating above you. They look worried.																						
48	41		301								Narration	Seeing their master has awakened, the natural spirits can wait no longer. They start to move.																						
49	42		301									The Constructs rush over to dig you out of the grave.																						
50	43		301								Narration	Unfortunately, your resurrection was witnessed by the gravekeeper, who happened to work for that local gang.																						
51	44		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Narration	You better leave before he calls for more gangsters.
