3	3		301			DialogEnable						The ocean reveals her fury. The water pressure pushes the sparse air in your lungs out before pushing seawater in, forbidding you to breathe.																						
4	4		301									Darkness, coldness, and silence surround you, dragging you further down.																						
5	5		301									You see shapes and figures flashing before your eyes.																						
6	6		301									Living or dead, familiar or otherwise, faces you remember being to walk toward you.																						
7	7		301									In your daze, you seem to hear someone calling you.																						
8	8		301								Nanami	Co... me... hand...																						
9	9		302								(Reach out!)	10																						
10	10		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					You feel a solid, metallic grip on your palm before a force pulls you upward—

14	14		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You escape the freezing water, breathing intensely, grasping for long-lost air. Bright, scarlet light casts away the darkness.																						
15	15		301									You look up and find a giant red star encompassing your vision.																						
16	16		302								A giant red star?	17																						
17	17		201							1	500472	1																						
18	18		301							1	Nanami	That's right. It's a sign that it's entering its last days.	1																					
19	19		301									Nanami, wearing an astronaut uniform, stands next to you.																						
20	20		302								We're doing space travel this time?	21																						
21	21		301								Nanami	Would you like that, Commandant?	1																					
22	22		302								It's pretty magical.	23	I'm glad we're not doing it realistically.	23																				
23	23		301									Ebullism, deadly radiation, and extreme temperature could have easily torn your body apart.																						
24	24		301									Instead, you are breathing perfectly fine in space. That defies all common sense.																						
25	25		201							1	500473																							
26	26		301							1	Nanami	Nanami has pulled some tricks so that you can move normally in space, Commandant.	1																					
27	27		201							1	500472	1																						
28	28		301							1	Nanami	I've been preparing this for a very long time. The moment has finally arrived.	1																					
29	29		301									Nanami looks at you, slowly extending you a hand.																						
30	30		301								Nanami	Commandant, will you come with Nanami for a ride?	1																					
31	31		302								(Reach out)	32																						
32	32		302								You don't have to ask.	33																						
33	33		302								This isn't like you.	34																						
34	34		301									Hearing that, Nanami pauses for a second before grabbing your hand tightly—so tight that you even feel a slight pain.																						
35	35		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Nanami	Hm!	1																					
36	36		202							1					1																			
37	37		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The universe is a huge place.																						
38	38		301									That is nothing new. You thought you knew this better than anyone else, having lived in Babylonia for so long.																						
39	39		301									But you have no idea.																						
40	40		301									With Nanami's "tricks," you get to witness all the wonders of the universe, and you cannot help but feel astonished—at first.																						
41	41		301									Nebulas formed from cosmic dust, crystal-clear white dwarves, star-devouring black holes, and galaxies, clashing and merging together...																						
42	42		301									But the most wonderful views become mundane when you observe them on the scale of the universe.																						
43	43		301									Lights and shades from billions of years ago created this infinite cage, bounding everything within the speed of light.																						
44	44		301									What you are seeing is but echoes of the past. You are perhaps just chasing phantoms.																						
45	45		301									The images caught by your eyes are merely remnants from eons ago. You are like the insect trapped in amber, jettisoned across time, forgotten.																						
46	46		301									...Where does reality begin?																						
47	47		301									The only things that ground you are the warmth you receive from your palm and the silver figure you see before you.																						
48	48		301									As if noticing something, Nanami stops moving forward.																						
49	49		201							1	500472	2																						
50	50		301							1	Nanami	I think that's all the time we have for a "walk." Time for you to go home, Commandant.	1																					
51	51		204							1	1																							
52	52		301								Nanami	Nanami's going to accelerate, Commandant. Don't let go.	1																					
53	53		302								(Grip tightly)	54

58	58		301									The scenery before you turns blue as all the stars transform into red streaks when they go past you, merging into the crimson nebula behind.																						
59	59		301									This is a "redshift," visible only when you accelerate to a certain speed. The blue in the distance signifies the future, while the red behind you indicates the past.																						
60	60		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The kaleidoscopic sight before you is bewitching, shattering any sense of dimension.

65	65		301							1	Nanami	Time to go back, Commandant.	1																					
66	66		301									She lets go of your hand and gives you a gentle push, sending you into the gravitational pull of the planet, and you fall toward Earth.																						
67	67		502							RImgBg1BlowUp																								
68	68		301									A sudden panic arises within you, and you shout at the tiny figure.																						
69	69		302								What about you?!	70

71	71		301							1	Nanami	Nanami is going to stay here, but...	1

88	88		301								Nanami	You're awake, Commandant! How do you feel?	1																					
89	89		302								Am I out already?	90																						
90	90		301									Your final space journey has left you feeling uncertain still. Although the familiar sights of your office surround you, you cannot tell if you are back in the real world.																						
91	91		301								Nanami	Of course. Look.	1																					
92	92		301									Nanami grabs some documents from the desk and hands them to you.																						
93	93		301								Nanami	These are the files you were still working on. Do you remember?	1																					
94	94		301								Nanami	Nanami might have installed many scenarios into Maple, but it's still impossible to replicate the details of the paperwork that even you weren't expecting, Commandant.	1																					
95	95		301									You take a closer look, and the progress made on those documents is the same as you remember. You are out of the simulation, it seems.																						
96	96		301								Nanami	Well then, Nanami's leaving, Commandant.	1																					
97	97		202							1					1																			
98	98		301									Nanami says that as she drags Maple out the door.																						
99	99		301									She sounded... contrite for some reason?																						
100	100		301									But before you can ask her about it, Nanami has vanished from your door.																						
101	101		302								Forget it...	102																						
102	102		301									Despite the many questions you have, you figure the proper thing to do is be patient and wait if she is not willing to disclose the truth to you yet.																						
103	103		301									Heading back to your desk, you find a cup of steaming coffee.																						
104	104		302								Nanami has grown up, hasn't she?	105																						
105	105		301									You grab the cup and take a sip—

115	115		301							1	Nanami	Hm... Where did I put it?	1

118	118		301								Nanami	Ah, there it is! You're brilliant, Maple!	1																					
119	119		301								Maple	Thank you for your compliment, Nanami. I recommend removing your screwdriver from the casing of my central processor unit, given that it is not where the port is.																						
120	120		301								Nanami	Hehe. Begin data transfer...	1																					
121	121		301								Nanami	Nanami must keep these memories safe and sound.	1																					
122	122		301								Maple	A question: Your storage unit also contains the relevant memories, Nanami. Why are you downloading Maple's data?																						
123	123		301								Maple	Maple thinks that it is pointless and a waste of resources.																						
124	124		301								Nanami	That's not a waste, Maple. Everyone would do the same if they could know more about each other this way.	1																					
125	125		204							1
