5	5		301									An invisible boundary divides the sky. The distant east shines with the first rays of morning, warm and bright. Yet the sky above remains cloaked in darkness, cold and deep.																						
6	6		301								　	This is a race toward the rising sun. Under the guidance of the Strike Hawk, you flee the deep and distant darkness as you set out for the bright and warm horizon.

18	18		301								　	It seems that as long as you do not think about it, the heavy sense of guilt will not overwhelm you.																						
19	19		301								　	On the way back, the desert is still and lifeless. Without the whale song, the Red Tide is now a stagnant pool.																						
20	20		301								　	Knowing everything that went into this, your pace becomes increasingly burdensome.																						
21	21		301								　	Among the haze, you see three familiar figures standing on a familiar hill in the distance.

27	27		301								　	Surviving this ordeal should have filled you with joy, but now there is only grief.																						
28	28		301								　	Looking around, you see Lee and Liv standing solemnly to the side. Only Lucia is here holding you tightly.																						
29	29		301								　	When choosing to act alone, you never seemed to consider their feelings.																						
30	30		301								　	You feel as if they should be capable of understanding your intentions.																						
31	31		301								　	At this moment, you deeply understand one thing—you should not risk your life as long as they are around.

36	36	43	301								Liv	You need to... You need to cherish yourself.	1																					
37	37		301								Lucia	—!	1

52	52		301								Lee	Regardless of the final outcome, it's an established fact that we acted without regard to the instructions of HQ.	1																					
53	53		301								Lee	Looks like this time we'll be tied up in military court for a while.	1																					
54	54		302								Got it.	55	Afraid?	58																				
55	55		301								Lee	...Are you not concerned in the slightest?	1																					
56	56		301								Lee	Is it because you've got a big heart? Or are you really that fearless?	1																					
57	57	61	301								Lee	Forget it. Now's not the time. All that matters is you made it back safe and sound.	1

63	63		301								　	He pauses in thought before continuing slowly.																						
64	64		301								Lee	Most of them have still chosen to stay.	1																					
65	65		301								Lee	However, some have decided to leave.	1																					
66	66		301								Lee	Considering that there aren't that many people, the temporary facilities will suffice, even if the conservation area on the surface is incomplete.	1																					
67	67		301								Lee	Babylonia will soon dispatch a transport craft to relocate them.	1																					
68	68		302								What about the others?	69																						
69	69		301								Lee	Honestly, this environment has already become inhospitable for humans.	1																					
70	70		301								Lee	Even though the Red Tide has stopped spreading, the remaining Punishing Virus has blocked their access to nearby cities.	1																					
71	71		301								Lee	They won't be able to hold out much longer here.	1																					
72	72		301								Lee	But if they choose to stay, all we can do is respect their decision.	1																					
73	73		302								So all of this was for nothing?	74																						
74	74		301								Lee	If consequentialism is the deciding factor, then most of the actions in the world are meaningless.	1																					
75	75		301								Lee	Not everything can be judged based solely on the number of survivors written in the report.	1																					
76	76		201							1	1031001																							
77	77		301							1	Liv	Lee's right. I don't think what you did was meaningless at all.	1																					
78	78		301								Liv	Commandant, you stood up for their hopes and dreams.	1																					
79	79		301								Liv	The fact that you fought until the last minute is precisely why both sides were able to come to a mutual understanding.	1																					
80	80		301								　	Mutual understanding?

83	83		301								　	With your thoughts still in disarray, you're unable to conjure up a response to the three people before you.																						
84	84		301								　	You cannot help but look to the scout who, like yourself, knows what really happened.																						
85	85		301								　	After undergoing emergency maintenance, Wanshi is now quietly lying on a haystack with his eyes closed as he basks in a sunbeam. He appears to be fast asleep.																						
86	86		301								　	For a moment, you do not know whether to think about if Constructs actually need sleep or to call him over.																						
87	87		301								　	After some consideration, you decide not to rush over and awaken him.																						
88	88		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				　	Having crossed such rugged terrain, a short respite is warranted.

94	94		301								　	Hans, dressed in his starched and pressed military uniform, stands quietly outside the camp.

109	109		301								　	Like a soul without a home, exiled by the atmosphere and gravity, drifting in low Earth orbit.																						
110	110		204							2	12																							
111	111		301								Hans	Now the children of Babylonia have forgotten about the Golden Age.	2																					
112	112		301									They forgot where they came from and how their culture was born.																						
113	113		301									They opened their eyes among the stars. For them, Earth is no different from the Moon.																						
114	114		301								Hans	We tell them that Earth is our home, but we can't tell them why.	2																					
115	115		301								Hans	Soon, everything will become a fragment of history.	2																					
116	116		301								Old Man	...	1																					
117	117		301								Hans	If I had to choose, I wouldn't leave.	2																					
118	118		301									But as a soldier, he had no choice.	2																					
119	119		301								Hans	Those who survive must continue the dreams of the dead.	2																					
120	120		301								　	Only the living can see tomorrow. Only the living can exact revenge. Only the living can have hope.

126	126		301								　	This burden of guilt nearly crushes him beneath its weight.																						
127	127		301								　	But it will also become a chain that binds him to the battlefield, forcing him to continue facing all hell before him.																						
128	128		301								　	Until he dies, he will fight—fight his way.																						
129	129		301								　	No matter how disgraceful and despised by others... he will fight until his heart stops and shatters to pieces.																						
130	130		301								　	Only he himself knows that he is not the "unyielding pine" others saw him as.																						
131	131		301								　	Rather, he is just a tombstone that refuses to topple.

138	138		301								　	In a trance, he seems to hear the sound of waves.																						
139	139		301								　	Must be his imagination...																						
140	140		301								　	From this distance, even the ocean breeze would be unable to carry the sound this far.																						
141	141		301								　	This is only a residual sound from his memory.
