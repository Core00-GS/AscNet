12	12		301								Roland	Indeed... But alas, I must bid thee farewell!	1																					
13	13		302								Get back here!	14																						
14	14		301								Lucia	You're going to leave the Witch of the Sea behind just like that?	2																					
15	15		301								Roland	Witch of the Sea?	1																					
16	16		301								Roland	Oh, you mean Ide...	1																					
17	17		301									He turns around with a smile and looks at the motionless mechanoid lying on the ground.																						
18	18		301								Roland	The boring obsession of those three sisters should finally be over now.	1																					
19	19		302								Three sisters?	20																						
20	20		301								Roland	Forget it. It's nothing important.	1																					
21	21		301								Roland	After all, only Ide was corrupted. As for the other two... Who knows, perhaps you've already met them somewhere?	1																					
22	22		301								Roland	Now that the administrator, Ide, has been taken care of, looks like you've achieved your goal of putting a stop to this facility.																						
23	23		301								Roland	Let's save the rest for the next time we chat.	1

34	35		301									He looks at the prince costume and bites his tongue as if trying to stop himself from speaking his mind.

53	54		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The sea breeze blows through the ship, loosens your bow tie and carries it away—																						
54	55		301									—drawing your attention back to the island which is now "deserted."																						
55	56		301									Before departing, the team agrees to Lucia's proposal to use the central hub to order the Mini Bots into the sealed underground facility.																						
56	57		301									But even then, the Punishing Virus will turn them into Corrupted given enough time.																						
57	58		301									So...

59	60		301							1	Lucia	We'll come back as soon as possible to restore this island back to its true glory. Ide...	1																					
60	61		301									She closes her eyes and listens to the whispers of the sea breeze. It seems to apprise the past and future of this island.																						
61	62		301								Lucia	When that time comes... No one will need to make sacrifices or bear such an undertaking alone. Those who have lost their way will no longer be preyed upon.	1
