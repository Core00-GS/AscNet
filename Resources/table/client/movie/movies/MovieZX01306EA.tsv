4	999002		301							1	Lee	...What a long detour. Looks like Roland deliberately laid those trails to mislead us.	1																					
5	999003		301								Lee	But no matter what, his trails vanished here. That's for sure.	1

8	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Lucia	There's a... hatch, hidden on the foundation wall...?	1																					
9	5		301									The trail ends before a hidden hatch on the foundation wall. Looks like Roland went through the hatch.																						
10	6		302								Lee.	7																						
11	7		201							1	500026																							
12	8		301							1	Lee	Got it. Cracking it open, now.	1																					
13	9		302								Liv, run a full scan.	10																						
14	10		201							1	1031001																							
15	11		301							1	Liv	Roger.	1																					
16	12		201							1	500026																							
17	13		301							1	Lee	Just a common industrial grade airlock. Door's open.	1																					
18	14		201							1	1031001	7																						
19	15		301							1	Liv	Wait! Lee! Don't move!	1																					
20	16		301									Liv gives a startled cry, and Lee immediately stops the movement of his hands.																						
21	17		302								What's the matter?	18																						
22	18		301								Liv	Commandant... Every meter down the hatch, the viral density spirals exponentially.	1																					
23	19		301								Liv	It's already at dead zone levels. If we open the door now, Commandant, you will die from the virus within five minutes.	1																					
24	20		201							1	500196																							
25	21		301							1	Karenina	****! How in the blazes can the viral density differ so much above and below ground?!	1																					
26	22		301								Karenina	Did they lay this entire freakin' place with partition tiles?! Talk about burning money!	1

29	25		301							1	Sophia	Now scanning... It's just like what Karenina said.	2																					
30	26		204							1																								
31	27		301								Karenina	You wot?	1																					
32	28		202							1	2				1																			
33	29		201							1	500166																							
34	30		301							1	Lucia	Can Constructs withstand this level of density?	1																					
35	31		201							1	1031001																							
36	32		301							1	Liv	No, I'm already reading higher density levels than most dead zones. It's not something an Inver-Device can offset!	1																					
37	33		301								Liv	It's almost... as if someone had maliciously concentrated all the nearby virus underground.	1																					
38	34		201							1	500155																							
39	35		301							1	Chrome	Just like that fishy Ascendant in Kowloong...?	1																					
40	36		302								Lamia?	37																						
41	37		301								Chrome	Yeah. The Ascendant who can freely control the viral density near her. Quite the hassle to deal with...	1																					
42	38		201							1	500026																							
43	39		301							1	Lee	If that's the case, we can't do anything about it...	1																					
44	40		201							1	500175																							
45	41		301							1	Camu	Hey, forgetting someone?	1																					
46	42		302								?	43																						
47	43		301								Camu	That nerd... Asimov told me something before the operationâ€”what Roland buried in the deepest recesses of my mind is something like an Ascnet terminal.	1																					
48	44		301								Camu	Which means that, I should be able to move freely even in high viral density areas, just like them.	1																					
49	45		201							1	1031001																							
50	46		301							1	Liv	...That, might indeed work.	1																					
51	47		201							1	500175																							
52	48		301							1	Camu	To make sure Kamui's safe. Our interests are aligned, temporarily.	1																					
53	49		301								Camu	You owe me one for this.	1																					
54	50		302								Thanks.	51																						
55	51		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Camu	Hmph, thank me when it's all over.	1
