10	8		301								Kamui	Just tell them we are maintaining the equipment. What do you think, Commandant?		1

21	12		301								Lee	All good. We still have Vera here. She has access to Kurono's express transport lines.	1

26	14		301							1	Kamui	Correct! Plus, I asked Miss Celica to secretly modify the game. I'm sure it's more fun than ever now.	3																					
27	4008		302								Somehow I am a bit worried with the "modify" part.	15	Have you played it yourself?	16																				
28	15	17	301								Kamui	What's there to worry about? Oh, I was quite surprised with the technologies she used though.	3																					
29	16	17	301								Kamui	Of course not. It's more fun when we play it from scratch together.	3																					
30	17		301								Kamui	So, what do you think?	3																					
31	18		301								Lucia	I don't mind going.	2																					
32	19		301								Lee	Lucia?	1																					
33	20		301								Lucia	It's necessary to have a break from work occasionally. The HQ had already sent other teams to take over. We just need to not become addicted to the game.	2																					
34	21		301								Lucia	What do you think, Commandant?	2																					
35	4009		302								If Lucia's alright with it...	22	Just let Kamui do what he wants.	23																				
36	22	24	301								Kamui	Hooray!	3																					
37	23	24	301								Kamui	Do what I want... I'm not a kid, Commandant.	3																					
38	24		301								Kamui	Let's hurry up then. There are six of us, including Commandant. We can split into two teams of three.	3																					
39	25		301								Lee	You never mentioned teams... Anyway, where's the sixth member you are talking about? There are only five of us!	1																					
40	26		301								Kamui	Oh, Camu was also showing a lot of interest. But he is already in the game now.	3																					
41	27		301								Lee	...Really? Can't he wait?	1																					
42	28		301								Kamui	Don't worry, he seems to be just watching the opening animation again and again.	3																					
43	4010		302								Doesn't he have anything better to do...	29	We better not keep him waiting then.	30																				
44	29	31	301								Lucia	I think maybe Camu just likes that animation.	2																					
45	30	31	301								Lucia	This is also a good opportunity for us to get along with Camu. Good thinking, Commandant.	2																					
46	31		301								???	Wait a sec.																						
47	32		301								Kamui	Not again?	3																					
48	33		301									Just when Kamui was about to take the team forward, another voice from behind stopped everybody once again. Kamui complained as he turned back.

53	35		301								Karenina	It's "us", Vera.	2																					
54	36		301									Under the sun were two Constructs wearing environment-specific Coatings. Vera and Karenina never stopped quarreling. They seemed to be on an operation together.

63	40		301								Karenina	Screw you!	2																					
64	41		301									They didn't seem to be getting along at all. In fact, I felt they were about to start fighting in the next moment.

67	42		301							1	Lucia	We are going to try this game that Kamui recommended. I don't mind if you come along, but can the game fit so many of us?	1

70	43		301							1	Kamui	Shouldn't be a problem. I don't see any limit on the instructions, and we could do two teams of four.	2																					
71	44		301								Lucia	Okay then. Speaking of which, you mentioned teams... Does it mean that we will play against one another in this game?	1																					
72	45		301								Kamui	Celica said it was more like a traditional role-playing game. I guess the teams are just to compete with each other for fast clearing or something similar.	2

81	49		301								Vera	No way. I said just to spice things up a little for fun.	1																					
82	50		301									Somehow, Vera kept staring at me while she was talking.																						
83	4028		201							2	500166		-400																					
84	51		301								Lucia	Hmm... It's up to Commandant to decide.	2																					
85	4029		302								Alright, but the request must be reasonable.	52	If you don't mind.	53																				
86	52	3000	301								Vera	Reasonable, huh... Fine, let's just keep it that way, Commandant of Gray Raven.	1																					
87	53	3000	301								Lucia	I think it's okay, because I have no plan to lose. Aren't you the same, Commandant?	2																					
88	3000		201							1	1081001	2	400																					
89	54		301							1	Kamui	I'm okay either way. Can we just go?	1

97	59		301									After arriving at the arcade game center, everyone followed Kamui's instructions to create their characters and put on their connectors.																						
98	60		301								Lee	Kamui, how are the teams assigned?																						
99	61		301									Lee asked Kamui in the dark.																						
100	62		301								Kamui	Celica said the system would randomly assign players to teams.																						
101	63		301								Lee	Does it mean that we may be playing against Commandant?																						
102	64		301								Kamui	Yeah, it's possible. But I'm not going to give in, even if Commandant is my enemy.																						
103	4032		302								Maybe just a little?	65	Don't blame me then.	66																				
104	65	67	301								Kamui	There's no such option in the game, Commandant.																						
105	66	67	301								Kamui	Hmph, you sound very confident, Commandant.																						
106	67		301								Kamui	Anyway, this game is fairly free, but bear in mind that players cannot kill important NPCs.																						
107	68		301									It's a common practice in many open world games. Some NPCs will mess up the entire game if they are killed by players.																						
108	69		301									Kamui completed some basic game settings. The arcade machines stared.																						
109	70		301								System	Starting... Loading game—Le*end...of...H*ro...X																						
110	71		301									After some stuttering electrical sounds, a mysterious title was displayed.																						
111	72		301									"Legend of the Executor - GR" was the title. Moments later, it was blurred and a few more words showed up, getting larger and larger...
