41	41		301								Roland	What can I do if I don't? Leave her alone, the worst she can do is to run. But if I force her to move with me when she has different thoughts in mind...	1																					
42	42		301									The illusion makes an "I knew it" smile.

49	49		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Lamia climbs onto a roof. She hears the never-ending gunshots, and begins to question herself.																						
50	50		201							1	500165																							
51	51		301							1	Lamia	(What do I do now...?)	1																					
52	52		301									The idea of running away has somehow made its way back. Perhaps she still fears Roland.																						
53	53		301									But Lamia has a vague feeling that if she walks away from Roland one more time, they will never meet each other again.																						
54	54		301								Lamia	(Why? Isn't this what I want? Why would I feel a little pity to leave him?)	1																					
55	55		301									Lamia starts to hesitate. She remembers "the thing" that keeps bothering her.																						
56	56		301									Leaving is of course the easier option. But if she can guide Roland to "that place" during his search for Luna...																						
57	57		301									Because he is Roland, so he can always get things done, whether it is for "Miss Luna"... or, Lamia.																						
58	58		301									Lamia purses her lips without realizing. Soon, she makes her decision.																						
59	59		301								Lamia	...I have to do this, eek...	1																					
60	60		301									She can run away anytime, but this is her only chance to get a powerful helper.																						
61	61		301									Lamia once tried to seek help from The Merciful One... And it did not end well.																						
62	62		301									Roland may be her last chance of getting "that thing" done.																						
63	63		401							1	36

68	68		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Roland walks in the deserted town. The scenes make him... somewhat uncomfortable.																						
69	69		301									Retro-styled streets, houses made from stones, paved road surface with trails pressed by anti-slip plates on carriage wheels.																						
70	70		301									—Roland feels uncomfortable.																						
71	71		301									What if all these traces were only added half an hour ago by the props team? What if the Corrupted weren't infected by the Punishing Virus, but an AI mechanoid specifically designed for this scene?																						
72	72		301									Roland just cannot stop thinking about these possibilities. Luna once made him believe in reality, but she is not here.																						
73	73		201							1	500334																							
74	74		301							1	Roland?	You don't look very good.																						
75	75		301								Roland	Look at me, hermano. What do you see?	1																					
76	76		301								Roland	A monster? A corpse? A weakling? A lost lamb?	1																					
77	77		301								Roland?	You're probably not going to like what I'm about to say.																						
78	78		301								Roland	I didn't get you here to say things that I can accept with pleasure.	1																					
79	79		301								Roland	Have "I" become so twisted that I must pretend in front of myself?	1																					
80	80		301								Roland?	What about you? Are you still going to act fragile and weak?																						
81	81		301								Roland	Say it.	1																					
82	82		301								Roland?	Can't you live without finding yourself a master? Do you have to let others hand the answer to you, even when you can find the answer yourself?																						
83	83		301								Roland?	You aren't that kind of person. At least you shouldn't be after leaving "The Mandhasti Real Park."																						
84	84		301								Roland	...	1																					
85	85		301								Roland?	You never change.																						
86	86		301								Roland?	Always looking for a lighthouse, a thing that can support you to continue forward.																						
87	87		301								Roland?	You are always seeking a purpose, but you never really think about it.																						
88	88		301								Roland?	After all these years, you and I both know who you are. You are not that kind of person.																						
89	89		301								Roland?	I suggest you... find a mirror, and take a good look at yourself.																						
90	90		301								Roland	...If we really can find one in this dull place.	1																					
91	91		301								Roland	What will I see... in the mirror?	1																					
92	92		301								Roland?	You guess.																						
93	93		301								Roland	...You take your time. I'm not in the mood for that.	1																					
94	94		202							1					1																			
95	95		301									Roland impales the remains of a Corrupted into the wall.																						
96	96		301									Some electronic structures within the remains are pressed and squeezed together by Roland's thrust, causing the body to tremble again, probably due to short circuits.																						
97	97		301									But Roland had seen it too many times... in his brief "previous life," or in "The Mandhasti Real Park."																						
98	98		301									Exaggerated hits, carefully designed and trained poses, and twisted fake deaths that were purposely acted in front of the "protagonist."																						
99	99		301									They are still alive physically, or mechanically. They will show up in the next scene and may portray a different way of death, but the deaths of the "characters" they are playing have been decided.																						
100	100		301									They are destined to die, so they cannot choose to live. The only option is to embrace a death that looks as real as a performance.																						
101	101		301									The mechanoid remains stuck in the wall are truthful in their performances. Roland's eyelid keeps twitching.																						
102	102		301									This whole deja vu experience feels like a cycle of destiny. It's all too ****ing absurd.																						
103	103		301									Every swing of Roland's chain blade seems pointless.																						
104	104		301									They aren't going to stop for fear.																						
105	105		301									The death of their kin isn't going to make them any crazier.																						
106	106		301									It's all but a part of a meaningless cycle.																						
107	107		301									This entire mess only leaves behind chaos. Even the victor will not feel like he has accomplished anything.																						
108	108		301									How absurd. Had my opponents ever felt this way?																						
109	109		201							1	500334																							
110	110		301							1	Roland	(Hah... Why bother.)	1																					
111	111		301									Through the remains and ruins, he walks into the group of buildings.																						
112	112		301								Roland?	You look a lot better now.																						
113	113		301								Roland	...We still have things to do.	1																					
114	114		301								Roland?	So, we're done here. What's next?																						
115	115		301									Roland doesn't answer his question, but looks at the streets ahead.																						
116	116		301								Roland	I don't need to worry about that. Our opponent has already prepared the red carpet.	1																					
117	117		301									Roland looks into the distance. On a filthy wall, someone wrote "Come this way" with red paint.																						
118	118		301								Roland?	...?																						
119	119		301								Roland	Whoever wrote this, I have no idea what they were thinking. But at least I get the message.	1																					
120	120		301								Roland?	Everything about it looks like a trap.																						
121	121		301								Roland	...Indeed.	1																					
122	122		301									Roland knows an unknown trap awaits him, but he doesn't have a chance.																						
123	123		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					He can only put himself at stake, betting for a one in a million chance.
