4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Bianca	Thank you for speaking up for me last time, Commandant.	1																					
5	5		302								I wasn't really able to do anything.	7	Don't you mind being called a fence sitter?	7																				
6	7		301								Bianca	It is true that I'm neither here nor there, isn't it? Not to mention that there's only so much one person can do. That wasn't your fight, Commandant.	1																					
7	8		301								Bianca	I can't keep my role as a Purifying Force member away when I'm on the Gray Raven Task Force.	1																					
8	9		301								Bianca	And I can't tackle my missions like a proper Purifying Force member when I'm there.	1																					
9	10		301								Bianca	From what I can tell, I do seem to be sitting on the fence, don't I?	1																					
10	11		302								You're a remarkable member of my squad.	12	But you managed to help a lot of people that way.	14																				
11	12	16	301								Bianca	I'm flattered...	1																					
12	14		301								Bianca	Do you mean the people from the Support Force?	1																					
13	15		301								Bianca	I didn't think they would thank me.	1																					
14	16		301								Bianca	I wasn't forced into the Purifying Force because of my model, Commandant.	1																					
15	17		301								Bianca	As I've told you, I don't intend to let the Purifying Force become a mindless coalition of butchers.	1																					
16	18		301								Bianca	That's why I've worked so hard to reach the position of leadership to make sure I know the story behind every case.	1																					
17	19		301								Bianca	Even if I got called a fence sitter... I will still abide by my belief until the very end.	1																					
18	20		301								Bianca	Just like what you did with me.	1																					
19	21		302								What did I do?	22																						
20	22		301								Bianca	...The constant gifts and the little acts of intimacy, of course. Have you forgotten already, or have you...	1																					
21	23		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Bianca	Either way, you surely are fearless, Commandant.	1
