29	37		301								Lucia	She's not our enemy?	1

33	40		302								Chiwen?	41	Deal?	41																				
34	41		301								Pulao	Like me, he's a member of the Kowloong Crew, in charge of trade.	3																					
35	42		301								Pulao	Well, trade... Realizing win-win scenarios, to be more precise.	3																					
36	43		301								Pulao	I don't know which one of us decided on you people, but the bottom line is we need your help, and that's why we invited you here.	3																					
37	44		302								Invited, huh?	45	That's a warm invitation.	46																				
38	45	241	301								Pulao	We didn't have a choice.	3

41	47		301								Pulao	Oh, by the way, I didn't get your names.	3																					
42	48		301								Pulao	Introduce yourselves!	3																					
43	49		204							1	1																							
44	50		301								Lucia	I'm Lucia, member of Gray Raven, an affiliation of Babylonia's task force. And these two here are my teammates, Liv and Lee.	1																					
45	51		301								Lucia	And this here is our commandant, „Äêkuroname„Äë.	1																					
46	242		204							3	4																							
47	52		301								Pulao	Babylonia? What's that?	3																					
48	243		204							3	1																							
49	53		301								Pulao	Eh whatever... I'm Pulao.	3																					
50	244		204							3																								
51	54		301								Pulao	I'm a, what do you call it again‚ÄîConstruct? Right. Also part of the Kowloong Crew and I guard this place. Forgot my real name, dunno if it's the collar or the experiments, I... well, I pretty much remember nothing about my past.	3																					
52	55		302								Collar?	56	Experiments?	56																				
53	56		301								Pulao	So many things to explain... I'll do it one by one.	3																					
54	57		301								Pulao	How much do you know about this ship?	3																					
55	58		302								Not much.	59	Very little.	59																				
56	59		301								Pulao	This ship is called the Nighter. It's a Kua-Er grade ship that used to serve as KCC's cargo vessel.	3																					
57	60		302								KCC?	61	Nighter?	63																				
58	61		301								Pulao	KCC is short for Kowloong Chamber of Commerce, a regional association founded by former East Asia. Back then, it wielded as much influence as the World Government.	3																					
59	62	64	301								Lee	I pulled up some relevant information from the database. It says that the KCC perished back when the virus broke out.	2																					
60	63		301								Pulao	People called this ship the Nighter because it only appears after dark. Over time, the name stuck.	3																					
61	64		301								Pulao	After the outbreak, the head of KCC put the ship into operation and saved people within KCC jurisdiction. That would have been the end of it, but then "that thing" got brought aboard as well.	3																					
62	65		302								That thing?	245																						
63	245		204							3	5																							
64	66		301								Pulao	"An efficient and objective decision-making AI system based on a constantly updated library of human cognition data."‚ÄîYou've heard of this song and dance, right?	3																					
65	67		302								What's that?	68	...Gestalt?	69																				
66	68	70	301								Pulao	An AI system called "Huaxu". KCC has been studying it.	3																					
67	69		301								Pulao	No, that thing's called "Huaxu".	3																					
68	70		301								Pulao	Anyway, Huaxu took over the ship, including its filtering system, supplies, and weapons. Huaxu connected everything aboard into a whole and enslaved the ship's leader‚Äîand us.	3																					
69	71		301								Pulao	Huaxu created three kinds of "collars". The physical kind worn by the humans on the ship. The other two kinds, designed for mechanoids and Constructs respectively, were built into them from the start.	3																					
70	72		301								Pulao	These three kinds of "collars" do basically the same thing. They can't be removed, and they make us obey.	3																					
71	73		202							1	2	3			1																			
72	74		301									Looking at „Äêkuroname„Äë, Pulao raises her jaw and points at her neck.																						
73	75		201							1	1031001																							
74	76		301							1	Liv	...So is Commandant "collared" too, now?	1																					
75	77		201							1	500145																							
76	78		301							1	Pulao	Naw, it's just a toy, but it beams similar signals. That's why you haven't been flushed out by the security system.	1																					
77	79		301								Pulao	Fuxi made that thing, huh...? I'm impressed.	1																					
78	80		201							1	1021001																							
79	81		301							1	Lucia	So this "collar" wouldn't actually harm Commandant?	1																					
80	82		201							1	500145																							
81	246		204							1	1																							
82	83		301							1	Pulao	Yep. It's a fake after all. But, I can't tell if it has any extra built-in functions.	1																					
83	247		204							1																								
84	84		302								So it's not 100% safe.	85	Anyway, back to the main topic.	87																				
85	85		201							1	500026																							
86	86	88	301							1	Lee	I'll give this device a thorough examination.	1																					
87	87		301								Pulao	...Shouldn't you care more about your safety?	1																					
88	88		201							1	500145																							
89	248		204							1	5																							
90	89		301							1	Pulao	Well, anyway, the "collars" are programmed to do two things. Force you to obey commands, and stop you from causing any direct damage to the ship and Huaxu.	1																					
91	90		301								Pulao	Huaxu can't control anyone's mind or make anyone shut up, and yet, we're all controlled by something this stupid.	1																					
92	91		301								Pulao	But, without sufficient resources or a filtering device, the people on the ship won't live on land. In the past, some did try to escape, some even rebelled, but more...	1																					
93	92		301								Pulao	...But more instead resort to a fickle dream. They appease Huaxu by following orders. They beg for Huaxu to have mercy and let them be on the ship.	1																					
94	93		301								Pulao	They're opiated. They dream of the day that the virus will be destroyed, and the ship will take them back to that port, to their home.	1																					
95	94		301								Pulao	The night market has everything, but the vendors have none. They are robbed clean by the monster they raised with their own hands. Now, they pay tribute to the monster in the form of taxes and mileage. Fail to do so, and get thrown off.	1																					
96	95		301								Pulao	To stay on the ship, they work tirelessly to trade and bargain and swindle others...	1																					
97	96		301								Pulao	How pathetic is that?	1																					
98	97		302								What about you?	98	Unlike those people, you have power, do you not?	99																				
99	98	100	301								Pulao	Do you mean the Constructs on the ship?	1																					
100	99		301								Pulao	Constructs have more authority than regular humans, but only to an extent.	1																					
101	100		301								Pulao	The nine Constructs that make up the Kowloong Crew came from a series of successful experiments. We're only useful puppets‚Äîtools and spare vessels designed to ensure the functioning of the ship.	1																					
102	101		302								Vessels?	102																						
103	102		301								Pulao	Huaxu has been looking for the perfect vessel.	1																					
104	103		302								What does that mean?	104																						
105	104		301								Pulao	...Huaxu wants to become human.	1																					
106	105		301								Pulao	Constructs are hybrids of humans and machines. Huaxu has been trying to plant the "minds" of machines into Constructs.	1																					
107	106		301								Pulao	Of course, I don't think Huaxu is self-conscious or has an actual free will.	1																					
108	107		302								Did he ever succeed?	108	So you are all just vessels for Huaxu?	109																				
109	108	110	301								Pulao	I'm not sure. But the experiment is still ongoing.	1																					
110	109		301								Pulao	Yes, we all are... including Lady Qu, the head of KCC.	1																					
111	110		201							1	1031001																							
112	111		301							1	Liv	So the original consciousness that existed inside these vessels...	1																					
113	112		201							1	500145																							
114	113		301							1	Pulao	...Will have their M.I.N.D. broken by Huaxu.	1																					
115	114		201							1	1021001																							
116	115		301							1	Lucia	...	1																					
117	116		201							1	500145																							
118	117		301							1	Pulao	Huaxu has been seeking a new vessel‚Äîa shell for Huaxu's mind.	1																					
119	118		301								Pulao	Unlike the night market, the trade fair is specifically set up for this purpose.	1																					
120	119		201							1	500026																							
121	120		301							1	Lee	Trade fair?	1																					
122	121		201							1	500145																							
123	122		301							1	Pulao	The trade fair is only for one kind of goods‚ÄîConstructs.	1																					
124	123		301								Pulao	Huaxu will command Lady Qu to do the picking for him.	1																					
125	124		301								Pulao	This will be the only time Huaxu, or I should say, the puppet in the form of Lady Qu, will show up in public.	1																					
126	125		301								Pulao	You are outsiders who aren't "collared". I hope you can help me, no... help us.	1																					
127	126		302								What do we need to do?	127	Sure.	128																				
128	127	128	301								Pulao	There's this main control room that acts as the brain of the ship. In order to free the ship from Huaxu's control...	1																					
129	128		202							1					1																			
130	129		301									Pulao pauses for a moment.																						
131	130		201							1	500145																							
132	250		204							1	1																							
133	131		301							1	Pulao	Thanks.	1																					
134	251		204							1	4																							
135	132		301								Pulao	Only the KCC's leader, Lady Qu, knows where the main control terminal is. Destroying that terminal should rid us of Huaxu.	1																					
136	133		301								Pulao	We need to snatch Lady Qu away from Huaxu, and the trade fair is the only window of opportunity.	1																					
137	252		204							1	1																							
138	134		301								Pulao	As for how to get ourselves into the trade fair and how to approach Lady Qu, I've got it all planned out. Just a bit of prep work, and we're good to go.	1
