15	15		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Karenina	Hey... Are you sure this is it?	1																					
16	16		301									Nanami nods, her eyes locking on the room before her. It is one of the storage rooms in Babylonia, many of which are long abandoned and their purposes unclear.																						
17	17		204							2	5																							
18	18		301								Nanami	It's inside...	2																					
19	19		204							2																								
20	20		301									Perhaps due to a malfunction, the automatic door has stayed open. Without any light, it is pitch black inside the room.

22	22		204							2	14																							
23	23		301								Nanami	Believe me... Nanami was just—ugh...	2																					
24	24		301									That is when Karenina notices the spark coming out of Nanami's left leg. The significant injury seems to suggest that this is indeed not a prank.																						
25	25		204							2																								
26	26		301								Karenina	Hey, are you alright?! How about we go look for help first...	1																					
27	27		301									Karenina knows that despite how she acts, Nanami is actually a formidable Construct.																						
28	28		301								Nanami	There's no time. If they reach somewhere crowded...	2																					
29	29		301									Nanami tries to climb up from where she is sitting, but the wound on her leg is apparently causing her a lot of pain.																						
30	30		301								Karenina	Nanami, go find help and get yourself fixed. Leave this to me!	1																					
31	31		204							2	1																							
32	32		301								Nanami	I know I can count on you, Karey deary! You're the strongest, most dependable person in Babylonia!	2

34	34		301								Karenina	I-is that so? Even stronger than... Lucia?	1																					
35	35		301									For a second, Nanami is not sure how to reply to her, but she quickly nods nevertheless.																						
36	36		301								Nanami	Yeah! I'm not sure what you meant... but Nanami thinks Karenina is the strongest of them all!	2																					
37	37		301								Karenina	That's, humph... Obviously!	1																					
38	38		301									Karenina acts like she is above Nanami's praises, but the subtle rises of the corners of her mouth suggest otherwise.

44	44		301									No one knows how long since the storage room last saw a visitor, but an acrid scent of dust attacks Karenina's smell sensor as she enters.																						
45	45		301									Carefully she steps forward, vigilant against any possible enemies.

61	61		301							1	Karenina	Cough—cough... No way that guy is alive with an explosion like this?	1

74	74		301								Nanami	How would there be Corrupted in Babylonia? Karey deary, fooling you is way too easy.	2

76	76		301								Nanami	Hm? Karenina, you look angry...	2																					
77	77		301								Karenina	****! Why wouldn't I be?!	1																					
78	78		301								Nanami	Because today's "April Fool's Day"! I read about it in the WGAA files! People can go around and pull pranks on each other, and the people who got pranked can't be mad!	2																					
79	79		301									Having snatched Nanami from running around, Karenina wants to scold her, but she is afraid that others will think of her as someone touchy.

93	93		301									Nanami takes a notebook out of nowhere and crosses out "Karenina" from a long list of names, indicating that Karenina has also fallen victim to her pranks.

103	103		301									The unannounced voice has indeed given Nanami a scare, her hair almost turning white from the fright.																						
104	104		301								???	Lies, deception, tricks... Fabricating falsehood for fun is no proper behavior from a high-level consciousness such as yours.	1																					
105	105		204							2																								
106	106		301								Nanami	But... it's April Fool's Day today! It's part of the human culture.	2																					
107	107		301								???	The human culture consists of elements both good and bad. You ought to learn from the human virtues and renounce their deceitful vices, continuing on the path of righteousness instead of pulling pranks for fun.	1																					
108	108		301								Nanami	But it's such an eventful holiday, I just want to play with my friends—and she hung up on me.	2

110	110		301									Nanami is about to explain herself when the voice disappears from her head without a sign the same way it appeared.																						
111	111		301									Although the nagging voice has gone, Nanami is no longer in the mood for more stunts. She takes a look at the notebook in her hand and put it back inside her pocket.
