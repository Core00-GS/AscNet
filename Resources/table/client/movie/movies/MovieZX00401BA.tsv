41	37		301								Kamui	Strike Hawks are professional scouts, so to gather intel, we always plant monitoring devices on our mission paths.	1																					
42	38		301								Kamui	These devices collect high-precision geo-data of the surroundings. If they are still intact, then the mapping should be done by now.	1
