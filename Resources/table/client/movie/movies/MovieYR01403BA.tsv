6	6		301								Roland	No. Why are you looking for her?	2																					
7	7		301								Gabriel	I just want to check on everyone's condition at all times. Lamia is not that stable, and I worry that she will do something strange.	1																					
8	8		301								Roland	It'll be okay. Besides, she's used to being alone.	2

21	20		301							1	Nanami	Hey, what did you say?	1																					
22	21		301									The park is now deserted, and in the empty corner, Nanami plays in the water while she makes fun of the machine in front her.

27	26		301								Nanami	Work itself represents failure! You get it?	1																					
28	27		301									Faced with a lecture from Nanami, the machine is motionless, and makes no indication.																						
29	28		301									In the end, Nanami can't think of any more excuses to use, and the machine finally moves.

34	33		301									Nanami rolls on the ground like a child throwing a tantrum. The frame has not had its strength adjusted and shatters the floor.

36	35		301							1	Machine	I have no power to stop you either, but Nanami, you have to remember to do what you should do.	1

38	37		301							1	Nanami	I know!	1																					
39	38		301									Nanami keeps the lying-down pose as she turns her back to the machine and complains.
