14	13		301								Cyril	The very first virus outbreak... Took place just after I left Islay.	2																					
15	14		301								Cyril	Do you know that Islay made the best whisky? I really miss that peat flavor...	2																					
16	15		301								Cyril	My wife had some leg problems. She could only walk out to the garden...	2

24	23		301								Cyril	Look at me, Captain, "Beak of Islay", what a fancy name! But I couldn't even protect my own family!	2																					
25	24		301								Cyril	I learned this the hard way long ago. But my son didn't understand...! I cut off all the possible ways for him to join the army, only to find out he joined the mercenary...	2																					
26	25		301								Cyril	I only learned about his death after three months! Three bloody months... There wasn't even a proper obituary...	2																					
27	26		301								Cyril	(Coughs fiercely)	2

31	30		301									Cyril refuses the water offered by Watanabe. He supports himself with a hand on the desk. For quite some time, his chest moved up and down before he finally raises his head and stares at Watanabe.

33	32		301							1	Cyril	What happened to you after that? I heard the Construct reconstruction surgery isn't easy... Did you do it because of the pay?	1

36	35		301							1	Watanabe	...	2																					
37	36		301								Watanabe	To be honest, I joined the mercenary for the money in the beginning.	2																					
38	37		301								Cyril	Some wanted fame, some wanted wealth. Some might do it out of impulse. But the army is never as simple as you think, young blood.	1

41	40		301								Watanabe	With all due respect, Captain, Bruce never joined the army out of impulse. He had his beliefs...	2																					
42	41		301								Watanabe	If you could have more time with him, I'm sure you would be proud of him.	2																					
43	42		301								Watanabe	I could not understand why Bruce insisted to stay and continue searching.	2																					
44	43		301								Watanabe	But since then I've witnessed too many tragedies and lost too many people...	2																					
45	44		301								Watanabe	I walked 10km in the snow, dead bodies everywhere. Broken limbs hung from trees like firecrackers.	2																					
46	45		201							2	500106																							
47	46		301							1	Cyril	This is a world where human lives don't matter anymore.	2

49	48		301							1	Watanabe	...	2																					
50	49		301								Watanabe	But now, I slowly begin to understand Bruce.	2																					
51	50		301								Watanabe	If I became a Construct... I may be able to kill one more Corrupted and save one more person. I never had any direction in life, but ever since I became a Construct, I found the reason to live on.	2																					
52	51		301								Watanabe	Bruce taught me that.	2																					
53	52		301								Watanabe	He was a great friend.	2

60	59		301							1	Watanabe	Maintenance equipment and supplies?	2																					
61	60		301								Cyril	That's what they told everyone else. But really, they are just sending the "VIPs" and their belongings away from the war.	1

71	70		301								Cyril	Humans are going extinct, but Babylonia still has the luxury to ship artworks. Very admirable, don't you think?	1																					
72	71		301								Watanabe	...	2																					
73	72		301								Watanabe	...Babylonia is in a very special situation. We can't rule out the possibility that some people with ill intent are planning something.	2																					
74	73		301								Watanabe	How did you get this confidential information?	2																					
75	74		301								Cyril	Don't forget I served three times longer than you did.	1																					
76	75		301								Cyril	Have you realized the true nature of those people, young man?	1																					
77	76		301								Cyril	This government that you are fighting for... Are they the saviors, or just a bunch of cowards... You better see with your own eyes.	1
