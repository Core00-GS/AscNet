9	9		301									Pulao pushes the door open. The room looks no different from when she left. Master sits in front of the counter, his eyes red and exhausted. He only becomes a little lively after seeing Pulao.

54	54		301									Standing against the sunlight, Pulao is unable to see the exact shape of the crowd appearing in the doorway. Before her eyes can adjust, she hears a piercing buzzing sound from the shadow standing at the very front.																						
55	55		401							2	636																							
56	56		301									The red-haired man takes a step forward and swishes his blade in the air, shaking his windbreaker. After finishing his performance, he carries the blade on his shoulder and raises the other hand, pointing to the sky.

64	64		401							2	752

73	73		301									After Demon Bane lands, a green-haired man smashes his head on the ground. Pulao can feel the wooden floor under her feet trembling slightly even from far away.																						
74	74		301									But it is only a start. The whistles in the crowd now begin to form a regular rhythm. The green-haired man spins violently on his head, following the rhythm. The bald spot on his head obviously has something to do with this skilled movement.																						
75	75		401							2	1503																							
76	76		301									After a few seconds of spinning, he straightens his legs, jumps from the ground with a swirl kick and makes a superhero-style entrance on one knee.

103	103		301									He is shouting out "hoo-ha" loudly. Strange breathing sounds are coming from his vocal cord. Other people start to make rhythmic finger snaps around him.
