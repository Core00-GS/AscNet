6	6		301									Following where Liv is pointing at, you find a neatly written slogan on the wall of an abandoned building.

11	11		301								Liv	It looks kind of new as well. Could one of the scavengers have written this?	1																					
12	12		301								Lucia	You don't usually see scavengers being so optimistic.	2																					
13	13		301								Liv	True... Which reminds me, I think I read something similar in that book from before.	1																					
14	14		301								Lucia	You mean that "Cardman Rider Genesis" book? The handwriting does look kind of similar. It might be written by the same person.	2																					
15	15		301								Lucia	But the words below the slogan look like they are written by someone else.	2																					
16	16		301									A hazily written "of course" can be seen below the slogan. There seems to be something else after these two words, but they have been roughly scrubbed off.																						
17	17		302								It really is the owner of the book.	18
