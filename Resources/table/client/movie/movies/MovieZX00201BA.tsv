10	7		301							1	Lee	You know, aside from having to pass through the giant and murderous belt of space debris corrupted by the virus, everything was fine.	2																					
11	9		201							2	1021001		-400																					
12	10		301							1	Lucia	Because of the mobility of the drop pod, we managed to pass through that area without requiring support. There was no better way of landing, Lee.	2

14	13		301							1	Liv	Lucia... I think Lee was just... joking.	2

16	16		301							1	Lucia	Ah... Is that... so...	2																					
17	17		301								Celica	Well, good to see you all getting along.	1																					
18	18		301								Celica	I'll spare the pleasantries. Your mission this time is to defeat the special Corrupted model named "Iron Maiden", and retrieve from her more information about the "Ascendants".	1																					
19	19		301								Celica	According to the other squads, this Corrupted in particular has high combative capabilities.	1																					
20	20		301								Celica	To complete this objective, you must first coordinate with other squads and set up Iso-Devices in specific locations of the city. This will create a small isolation zone.	1																					
21	21		301								Celica	These isolation zones will form a ring, ultimately containing the movement area of the target.	1

27	27		301							1	Lucia	Yes, it only shows that the enemy is a force to be reckoned with.	2																					
28	28		301								Celica	Indeed. The enemy is powerful. Any squads coming into contact with the "Iron Maiden" must immediately contact all the other squads and wait for backup. Do not engage on your own.	1																					
29	29		301								Lucia	Understood.	2																					
30	30		301								Celica	There are sealed Iso-Devices near your landing zone. You'll have to find access to it to utilize them.	1																					
31	31		301								Celica	One more thing, HQ has sent a Construct in your vicinity to aid you in your mission... You should make contact soon.	1																					
32	32		301								Celica	With that, I wish you all a smooth mission.	1

38	38		301							1	Liv	Lee, do you know about the Iso-Devices?	1																					
39	39		301								Lee	Yes. It's something from Cosmos Technician Union. It emanates a Corrupted-repelling field for a certain amount of time.	2																					
40	40		301								Lee	But setting it up will take time. It's also quite weighty and unwieldy—typical of those technicians...	2																					
41	41		301								Liv	Speaking of production... The first thing I knew about you was that you're skilled technician, Lee. I even thought you were Cosmos Technician Union. I had no idea that you were actually from Kurono.	1																					
42	42		301								Lee	I was just a non-staff personnel. Didn't stay there long.	2

55	55		301								Nanami	Um, what was I doing just now? Those graffiti looked super-duper interesting so Nanami decided to take a walk around to see more of it.	1
