7	7		301							1	Watanabe	The Ascendants are formidable foes after all. Though that "Huaxu" thing's taken, we still kept the city intact in the end... Sort of.	2																					
8	8		301									After the battle in Kowloong, Akdilek and the Forsaken returned to their campsites to rest. The leaders are now sitting and discussing the next issue.																						
9	9		301								Jamilah	But they likely won't be thanking us for this. Most of Kowloong is in ruins. Even if they manage to salvage the place, rebuilding will likely be hell for them.	1																					
10	10		204							1	1																							
11	11		301								Jamilah	Speaking of, you know what the link chamber is?	1																					
12	12		301								Watanabe	I've heard of it before from some member who left Babylonia. It's a machine that allows a commandant to link remotely, or something... So what about it?	2																					
13	13		204							1	2																							
14	14		301								Jamilah	Babylonia seems to have successfully downsized these chambers.	1																					
15	15		301								Watanabe	Downsizing... Are they planning something big?	2																					
16	16		204							1																								
17	17		301								Jamilah	Probably. I only know that Babylonia is using their results for the foundation of their next step.	1																					
18	18		301								Watanabe	So that's why they're leaving squads in Kowloong to help them rebuild...	2																					
19	19		204							1	1																							
20	20		301								Jamilah	That's all the info I got. What about your end, Forsaken boss?	1																					
21	21		204							2	5																							
22	22		301								Watanabe	Don't get it wrong. I never agreed to exchange information with you.	2																					
23	23		204							1	13																							
24	24		301								Jamilah	Looks like you're trying to do a dine and dash on my train.	1																					
25	25		204							2																								
26	26		301									Watanabe's face takes on a stunned expression as Jamilah's words leave her mouth. After a short pause, he sighs resignedly.																						
27	27		204							1																								
28	28		301								Watanabe	...Fine. Just know that this info isn't something you can use as "goods."	2																					
29	29		204							1	1																							
30	30		301								Jamilah	Whether it can or can't is something I'll decide.	1

33	33		301									Watanabe hands a terminal to Jamilah. The screen shows a coordinate and a huge red X.																						
34	34		201							1	500125					1																		
35	35		301							1	Jamilah	What's this?	1																					
36	36		203							1	0.25	-400																						
37	37		201							2	1101001		400			1																		
38	38		301							1	Watanabe	This is information I got from... an Ascendant. It's supposedly their next target.	2																					
39	39		204							1	4																							
40	40		301							1	Jamilah	That red X is pointing to another Ascendant... Are Ascendants targeting other Ascendants?	1																					
41	41		301								Watanabe	Well, apparently, the leader of Kowloong is also an Ascendant. Maybe the Ascendants aren't all on the same side.	2																					
42	42		301								Jamilah	Indeed, this is also a possibility.	1																					
43	43		202							1	2				1																			
44	44		201							1	500124					1																		
45	45		301							1	Changyu	If there is infighting among the Ascendants, we will have an easier time, right?	1																					
46	46		401							2	1513																							
47	47		301									The one who spoke is Changyu, who has just finished vehicle maintenance. Sophia follows, holding her tools.																						
48	48		301								Changyu	Speaking of which... Leader, should we consider going to a water park for our next stop?	1																					
49	49		201							1	500125					1																		
50	50		301							1	Jamilah	A water park?	1																					
51	51		201							1	500124					1																		
52	52		301							1	Changyu	Yep. The location those coordinates point to is called... What was it...	1																					
53	53		203							1	0.25	-400																						
54	54		201							2	500127		400			1																		
55	55		301							1	Sophia	Venus Splash Park. In records of the Golden Age, it seems it was a "movie-themed private water park."	2																					
56	56		204							1	1																							
57	57		301								Changyu	Yep, yep, that one. Sophia and I happened to see it while assessing the database, and we even discussed going there.	1																					
58	58		204							2	10																							
59	59		301								Sophia	...You're the one who wants to go, Changyu.	2																					
60	60		204							1	5																							
61	61		301								Changyu	You didn't say you don't want to, Sophia!	1																					
62	62		204							2	5																							
63	63		301								Sophia	But Sophia has warned Changyu that the Venus Splash Park is surrounded by the ocean and there is no known track leading there.	2

65	65		201							1	500125	1				1																		
66	66		301							1	Jamilah	...What a strange choice. Have you heard anything else?	1																					
67	67		203							1	0.25	-400																						
68	68		201							2	1101001		400			1																		
69	69		301							1	Watanabe	That's all. The Ascendants didn't hide their tracks intentionally, and if Babylonia is not blind, they will know soon after we know.	2																					
70	70		204							1	2																							
71	71		301								Jamilah	Is that why you said this can no longer be called "goods"?	1																					
72	72		301								Watanabe	Yes... If we calculate from the time we boarded the vehicle, it should be arriving at the station about now.	2																					
73	73		301								Jamilah	Right. Just get off at the broken stop ahead?	1																					
74	74		301								Jamilah	If it's you guys, I think it won't hurt to stay on the train. We will have an empty carriage after the re-org. So how about it? Want to become an Akdilek member?	1																					
75	75		204							2	5																							
76	76		301								Watanabe	...Stop joking. The Forsaken are an independent group and we have no interest in serving anyone else.	2																					
77	77		204							1	1																							
78	78		301								Jamilah	I know you have a history with Babylonia, but that shouldn't stop us from working together.	1																					
79	79		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Watanabe	No need to worry about that. The Forsaken... are not a group formed from grudges and obsessions.	2
