18	82		301							1	Karenina	We may need to take this guy together.	2																					
19	83		301							1	Lee	Wow, tactics. From you?	1

28	92		301							1	???	The mere and humble performer model IX‚ÄîBunshiro is pleased to make your acquaintance.	1																					
29	93		301							1	Karenina	"Bunshiro"? Is that your name?	2																					
30	94		301							1	Bunshiro	If you wish, my lady.	1																					
31	95		302								What are you doing here, Bunshiro?	96																						
32	96		301							1	Bunshiro	I will be playing the character of Bunshiro in the play of "Blessed Bunshiro or: How I Defeated the Dark Ghasts of Yama".	1																					
33	97		301							1	Bunshiro	Though, regrettably, I can only perform the second last act of "And so fades the stars, and I shall wear justice" for you.	1																					
34	98		302								Why is that?	99																						
35	99		301							1	Bunshiro	The only performer still fit to take the stage, is me.	1																					
36	100		202							1	2				1																			
37	101		301									Originally, there were several hundred performers like me in our glorious and resplendent Glazed Arch.																						
38	102		201							1	500019					1																		
39	103		301							1	Bunshiro	On that very day, we were supposed to be running our headlining act, "The Gilded Age".	1																					
40	104		301							1	Bunshiro	The play starred both the grand master and the second master of the Glazed Arch, Lian Yu, and Jing Mei. Countless Constructs were activated for the performance, and eighty of them were just the side characters and extras.	1																					
41	105		301							1	Bunshiro	But the cue to start the performance from the main control room never came.	1																					
42	106		301							1	Bunshiro	And before we noticed, the audience also vanished, to a man.	1																					
43	107		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Bunshiro	There was nothing we could do but wait... And the stage remained empty.	1																					
44	108		202							1					1																			
45	109		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Grand master Lian Yu was the first to be shut down. After all, he had the highest processing power and ate up the most energy.																						
46	110		301									The pride of the most esteemed performers‚Äîtheir specs‚Äîquickened their own death.																						
47	111		301									Without knowing when the play would begin... We could only try to limit our energy consumption...																						
48	112		301									And then we found out. The longer a performer spends off stage, the quicker they deteriorate.																						
49	113		301									...That left us no choice. We could only take turns and perform as much as we could.																						
50	114		201							1	500019					1																		
51	115		301							1	Bunshiro	And then there was one‚Äîme. As for the choice of the play today, I decided it together with the last functioning performer, before he too fell to eternal slumber.	1																					
52	116		301							1	Bunshiro	This act requires only a single martial performer. The broken mechanoids that are running around will do as the ghasts of Yama.	1																					
53	117		301							1	Bunshiro	I just need someone to command the play to begin. It can be done in the control booth in the back. And then... I can act.	1																					
54	118		201							1	1111001					1																		
55	119		301							1	Karenina	Why don't you just cue yourself in?	1																					
56	120		201							1	500019					1																		
57	121		301							1	Bunshiro	For us specialized mechanoids, the control booth is sacrosanct. We are wired to respect it.	1																					
58	122		301							1	Bunshiro	As a "character", we have no concept of a "backstage". One of you will have to go in my stead.	1

63	127		301							1	Sophia	Ayla. You look sad.	2																					
64	128		301							1	Ayla	H-huh? Oh, no. I just... think we should help him finish his last act.	1																					
65	129		301							1	Ayla	To pine for a turn that will never arrive, to wait for a Godot that never comes... For any artist or performer... That's too cruel a fate.	1																					
66	130		302								...Then let's get the show going.	131																						
67	131		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Ayla	Yes! Thank you, Commandant!	1

72	136		301							1	Ayla	I found records of this play in the WGAA archives. Looks like the plot concerned a main character provoking some soldiers in an attempt to start a fight.	1																					
73	137		301							1	Ayla	All we need to do is make sure Bunshiro isn't harmed by the Corrupted as he delivers his lines and runs through his blocking.	1

75	139		301								Automated Voice	As the azure clouds shroud the skies and the dark cyclones ravage the lands, the Yama ghasts entrap our brave heroes‚Äî

77	141		301							1	Bunshiro	Aha! You have finally shown yourself, scoundrel!	1																					
78	142		301							1	Bunshiro	Thou hath pilfer'd lives sixteen surnamed Bun, now thy ghasts besiege towns of folk by the million!	1																					
79	143		301							1	Bunshiro	Heaven may be blind, yet I‚ÄîBunshiro‚Äîam not!	1																					
80	144		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Bunshiro	On, on, on, on, on! Hear, hear, forces of Bun! We fight till our death today! Bring the ghasts their second death!	1
