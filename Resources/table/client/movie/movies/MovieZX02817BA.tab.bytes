8	8		301								Roland	Oh c'mon... I can forgive you for not putting up a red carpet, but you should have at least sent some fans to welcome Roland the superstar.	1

21	21		301								Roland	Okay, we have some audience here... Quite a lot actually.	1																					
22	22		301									Following the arm are the Construct base models. They land in Roland's vicinity and rush toward Roland once managing to crawl up.																						
23	23		301									He just realizes these incomplete Constructs were infected by the Punishing Virus and turned into horrific Corrupted long ago.

34	34		301								Roland	I really wonder who is stealing my entrance...	1																					
35	35		301									Roland takes out the container and peeks at the stem cell inside, using the explosion as a light source. The low-gravity environment does not seem to have any impact on it.																						
36	36		301								Roland	Since I took the job, I must finish it no matter what. That's what I call being a professional actor.	1																					
37	37		204							1																								
38	38		301									Roland closes his eyes to find that weak connection between Luna and him... He can sense her a lot clearer. She is definitely on the Moon.

60	60		301							1	Karenina	Why are you here??	1

66	66		301									Yarha trots over scratching his head, asking Teddy about some problems he is facing on his portable terminal.																						
67	67		201							1	500494	7

71	71		301							1	Teddy	We split into two groups. Some non-technical staff evacuated to protect the injured people. They stayed away from the lunar base and waited for rescue, while we technicians came back here to keep working.	2																					
72	72		204							1	6																							
73	73		301								Karenina	****! What are you doing here?! I said I could do this all by myself!	1																					
74	74		301									Seeing Karenina's anger, Teddy smiles instead.																						
75	75		204							2	13																							
76	76		301								Teddy	Feeling good about yourself, huh...? We only came back for ourselves.	2																					
77	77		201							2	500361		-400																					
78	78		301							1	Engineer	Correct! Just like what the vice-captain said, if we run away and leave you behind, we would be held responsible for letting you destroy the zero-point engine without taking necessary precautions. Gotta do something to defend ourselves.	2																					
79	79		204							1	5																							
80	80		301								Karenina	You...	1																					
81	81		301								Engineer	And, Captain Karenina, I'm not new here. It's been two years since I joined the Engineering Force... Oh, two years and three months.	2																					
82	82		202							2																								
83	83		301									The researcher in the Engineering Force quickly reported the situation and interrupted Karenina's question. He returned to work in no time.

85	85		201							2	500495		-400																					
86	86		301							1	Teddy	We are doing our best to collect and record the data related to the zero-point engine for its future restoration and improvement.	2																					
87	87		301								Karenina	Restoration and improvement...? Is that really possible?	1																					
88	88		301								Teddy	Probably depends on our luck and speed. In the past, we only had the right to use the engine. Kurono had always been in our way whenever we wanted to investigate the related records.	2																					
89	89		204							2	13																							
90	90		301								Teddy	But that's no longer a problem. The entire base is probably going to be blown up soon.	2

92	92		203							1	0.25																							
93	93		301									Karenina gets the terminal from Teddy and looks at it. The research data recorded is indeed highly confidential and has never been disclosed in public research. If they can also include the data observed while the engine was running and even going out of control...																						
94	94		301								Karenina	Perhaps making a new zero-point engine isn't impossible...	1																					
95	95		301									Karenina looks at Yarha. The people in Kurono have no reason to risk their lives to help them.

98	98		301							1	Yarha	Sigh... I don't want to become space junk, but Kurono's internal punishment is even scarier. That's why I must get something done at least, so I can bargain with them!	2																					
99	99		301								Yarha	Especially after Miss Vesalius became the research director... I really can't go back empty-handed.	2

103	103		301									Karenina looks at other Kurono researchers. They don't seem to be working only for their own lives.																						
104	104		201							1	500495	4																						
105	105		301							1	Teddy	Hey you, pack up the tools! We're almost done here in the power lab. Next, we need to go near the zero-point reactor and record its energy output and conversion ratio.	1																					
106	106		301								Teddy	The devices over there have all been contaminated... We probably have to take the readings on our own.	1

119	119		301								Teddy	Are you concerned about the consequences of destroying the zero-point engine...? That's totally not like you, fool.	2																					
120	120		301								Teddy	Don't think too much. Just focus on the things that you must do... Leave the rest to us. You have friends who are willing to fight alongside you too.	2

132	132		301								Teddy	Remember, don't die. If our effort ends up in vain because of you, I will hunt you down even in hell.																						
133	133		301								Yarha	Better touch wood, Teddy. I'm sure she will succeed...																						
134	134		301								Karenina	Hmph! Just wait and see!

140	140		301			DialogEnable				1		Roland steps over the twisted door of the Construct lab. It seems to have been deformed by some tremendous force.																						
141	141		301									In the center of the lab is the white figure he has been searching for.																						
142	142		301								Roland	Luna...	1																					
143	143		201							1	500504																							
144	144		301							1	Luna	...	1																					
145	145		201							1	500334																							
146	146		301							1		Roland calls her name softly but receives no response. He can feel the connection between Luna and himself is weakening‚Äîwhich means the agent Luna is dying.																						
147	147		301									A ring-shaped device is draining the Punishing Virus from her and disintegrating it eventually.																						
148	148		301								Roland	This must be the Omega Weapon... I wonder if I can free Luna if I break it?	1																					
149	149		401							2	1511

154	154		401							2	1543																							
155	155		301									Roland smiles and puts his shotgun away. He knows even if he rescues Luna here, it would only momentarily extend her life.																						
156	156		301								Roland	Nobody can rewrite your own story except you, Luna... If your ending is a silent death on this cold Moon, maybe that is just what fate brings.	1																					
157	157		301								Roland	Still, I wish you can change the ending yourself and embark on your journey again... The person who asked me to bring this gift to you would probably feel the same.	1

159	159		401					300		2	952																							
160	160		301									Roland takes out the storage unit he has been carefully protecting and inserts it into the control panel in front of Luna that connects to her M.I.N.D. Although Kurono does not have the technology to hack into the M.I.N.D. of agents, it can still send them a message.																						
161	161		301									The container on Roland's waist begins to tremble vigorously as if the thing inside is banging against the container wall.																						
162	162		204							1	1

165	165		301									Roland opens the container. The surging matter inside quickly crawls toward the cable connecting to the Omega Weapon, then squeezes itself into the cracks on the wall following zero-point energy's unique blue glow.																						
166	166		204							1	2
