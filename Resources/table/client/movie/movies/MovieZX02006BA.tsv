4	3		301			DialogEnable	DialogDisable					With No. 21 pointing the way, you do discover signs of battle in the hospital reception. The device used to detect abnormal M.I.N.D. fluctuation that she has brought along has not stopped beeping either.																						
5	4		302								Luna was here...	5																						
6	5		302								And she was in a fight.	6																						
7	6		301			DialogEnable						You cannot find more information even with the device afterward.																						
8	7		302								Looks like she's left a long time ago.	8

10	9		301							1	No. 21	This... feels familiar.	1																					
11	10		301									Indeed. Ever since you entered the hospital, you have had the same feeling, just like back in the precinct.																						
12	11		301								No. 21	Not before the connection.	1																					
13	12		302								You only felt it after connecting with me?	13																						
14	13		301								No. 21	Yes...	1																					
15	777		401							2	1516																							
16	14		301									As she answers, No. 21 walks forward alongside the hallway, guided only by instincts and the thumping familiarity.

21	16		301									The creepiest thing happens. Blurry white shades appear around No. 21 like a scene straight out of a movie, and then the hallway is filled with these apparitions in white gowns, walking back and forth through her.																						
22	17		204							1	5																							
23	18		301								No. 21	Ugh!	1																					
24	19		301									Alerted, she raises her hackles like an agitated beast, looking around and growling at the shades approaching her.																						
25	20		302								They're just illusions. They can't hurt you.	21	Are we seeing the hospital in the past?	21

27	22		301									The strange girl appears again ahead of you, her hand holding a bundle of daisies. Standing opposite her... is a gentle-looking shade.																						
28	23		301								???	...My dad's coworker gave me that!																						
29	24		301									The image is not clear. You can only vaguely see the profile of the girl.																						
30	25		301									The person opposite her bends down slightly, patting the girl's hair.																						
31	26		301									You can almost feel the soft touch on your skin, the scent of rubbing alcohol on those hands, and the love in the tender movement.																						
32	27		201							1	500328																							
33	28		301							1	No. 21	...	1																					
34	29		301									Stunned by the peculiar warmth in her chest, No. 21's defensive, raised arms lower to her sides.																						
35	30		202							1					1																			
36	31		301								???	...I just want to go back with you, Mom...

44	35		301									No. 21 approaches the shade instinctively for a closer look. But the moment she steps forward, all images disappear, leaving behind the Medic Bots and equipment in the dilapidated corridors as if nothing has happened.																						
45	36		302								...	781																						
46	781		401							1	201																							
47	37		301								No. 21	Were there...	1																					
48	38		301									She pauses for a second before deciding to ask it out loud.																						
49	39		301								No. 21	Were there experiments here?	1																					
50	40		302								Experiments?	656																						
51	656		204							1																								
52	41		301				DialogDisable				No. 21	...Machines, pill bottles, people in white gowns, Medic Bots, scientists. Is this a place where they perform experiments?	1																					
53	42		302								(She's alarmed... because she's mistaken doctors as scientists?)	43																						
54	43		302								It isn't... despite it looks similar to a laboratory.	44																						
55	44		302								This is a hospital. It's a place where they treat other people.	45																						
56	45		301			DialogEnable					No. 21	Treat?	1																					
57	46		302								They take away the pain and hurt people are feeling.	47																						
58	47		204							1	3																							
59	48		301									She shakes her head slightly.																						
60	49		301								No. 21	Experiments cause pain, not take it away.	1																					
61	50		301				DialogDisable				No. 21	This place treats people, not experiments on them. It's different from a research institute. I understand it now.	1																					
62	51		302								...Looks like we aren't going to find anything else here.	52																						
63	52		302								Let's go meet up with Vera.	53																						
64	53		301			DialogEnable						No. 21 takes one last look at the end of the hallway, recalling the warm sensation she had never felt before, and a sense of disappointment lingers in her M.I.N.D.																						
65	54		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				No. 21	...I understand.	1

68	56		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After confirming Vera's current location with the Kurono agents, No. 21 begins her trek.																						
69	689		401							2	1516																							
70	57		301									She slows down when she passes the precinct again.																						
71	58		204							1	4																							
72	59		301								No. 21	It's different...	1																					
73	60		302								Huh?	61																						
74	61		301								No. 21	The car with the broken window is gone.	1																					
75	62		301									You take a careful look around, and the police car with the broken window has indeed disappeared.																						
76	63		401							2	885																							
77	64		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					As you search, the sound of an engine starting appears behind you.
