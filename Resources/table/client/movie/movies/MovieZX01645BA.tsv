3	3		301			DialogEnable						Lucia opens her eyes and finds Liv and Lee before her in an intense battle with Roland.																						
4	4		301									Facing only half of the Gray Ravens, Roland does not fight as hard as he did, and instead pushes the two around with sporadic attacks, seemingly trying to stall for time.																						
5	5		301									And you, standing nearby, carry multiple injuries as if you have just been through a gruesome battle.

8	8		302								You're awake?	9	Good morning.	9																				
9	9		301								Lucia	Your wounds...!	1																					
10	10		302								Had to stay awake.	11	Tactics.	11																				
11	11		301								Lucia	Commandant...	1																					
12	12		301								Lucia	No. It's no use worrying now. I have to help everyone defeat Roland—that's the only way Liv can have time to treat Commandant!	1																					
13	13		302								You look more determined.	14																						
14	14		301								Lucia	(Nods) I was able to learn so much and return thanks to your Mind Beacon.	1																					
15	15		301								Lucia	I am not lost anymore.	1																					
16	16		202							1																								
17	17		301									Lucia raises her sword and approaches Roland, but he immediately waves his hands and steps back.

20	20		301							1	Roland	Looks like I guessed correctly. Lucia, you're the superior one.	1																					
21	21		301								α	Gray Raven!	2																					
22	22		202							1	2																							
23	23		301									Although the battle inside her M.I.N.D. has affected her gravely, Alpha still manages to stand up with rage in her eyes, pulling her katana from the floor and charging Lucia.																						
24	24		401							2	10001004																							
25	25		301									But a few shots arrive unexpectedly from her blindspot, forcing her to back away.

29	29		301									A dark orb appears by Alpha's feet, creating a local gravitational pull that destabilizes her and causes her to fall.

32	32		301							1	α	Huaxu, what the hell?!	2																					
33	33		301								Huaxu	Default computing power limit exceeded. Suppressions on the two Constructs released.	1																					
34	34		301								α	Tsk.	2

36	36		301									Distracted by the two attackers, Alpha fails to notice the fast-approaching Lucia. Lucia kicks her in the stomach and forces her back.																						
37	37		301									As Lucia is about to deliver a deadly blow, a chain blade comes out of nowhere and deflects her strike.																						
38	38		201							1	500008																							
39	39		301							1	Roland	I'd love to say that "I'm the one you're looking for," but you guys gotta have noticed something's wrong, right?	1																					
40	40		204							1	4																							
41	41		301								Roland	Is it really a good idea to waste your time here?	1																					
42	42		302								What are you saying?	43																						
43	43		204							1																								
44	44		301								Roland	Oh, come on... You aren't seriously expecting me to explain everything?	1																					
45	45		302								There's someone bigger after you, isn't there?	46																						
46	46		301								Roland	Insightful, Commandant. Thank goodness you've noticed.	1																					
47	47		301								Roland	You still have a bit of walking to do. Best leave now, lest you miss the show.	1																					
48	48		301								Roland	As a token of goodwill, a parting gift.	1

50	50		301									He smiles as he tosses you Huaxu's key.

52	52		301							1	α	Ha! A betrayal. Of course you're a traitor.	1																					
53	53		201							1	500008																							
54	54		301							1	Roland	Oh, don't be so harsh. You and Lucia were out for a while, and Huaxu's suppression was long gone. Those three have been trying to find a way to take you out while you're down—and I also just "found my way" to the key.	1																					
55	55		301								Roland	Had I not been protecting you, we'd all be too late now.	1																					
56	56		201							1	500166	5																						
57	57		301							1	Lucia	What are you planning?	1																					
58	58		201							1	500008	4																						
59	59		301							1	Roland	Hmm? That reveal I'll save for the next time we meet. Now get going or you won't make it in time.	1																					
60	60		302								Let's go!	61

63	63		301							1	α	You wish!	2																					
64	64		301								Roland	Hold on, Alpha. I'm the one you're looking for.	1																					
65	65		301									Roland stands between Alpha and you and gestures you four to go.																						
66	66		301								Roland	Thanks to that Lucia, I think I can probably take on you now.	1																					
67	67		301								α	What are you after?	2																					
68	68		301									Roland stops smiling for once. His looks at Alpha, unwavering.																						
69	69		204							1	5																							
70	70		301								Roland	I've only ever wanted one thing.	1																					
71	71		301								Roland	But telling you now would be really stupid.	1																					
72	72		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				α	...Seems to me you're prepared for the consequences.	2
