17	13		301								Corrupted	Please share with us the power of Miss Luna...																						
18	14		301								Corrupted	And relieve us of the Punishing Virus...																						
19	15		301								Luna	How naive... Only by embracing and accepting it, are you fit to control the power of the Punishing Virus.

24	20		301								Roland	To join the core of Ascnet and be bestowed Miss Luna's power, you will have to prove yourself—																						
25	21		301								Roland	Prove that you are crueler... more dreadful... and deadlier... than the virus.																						
26	22		301								Roland	Only so, are you fit to become the owner of the virus, do you understand?

32	28		301								Luna	Roland.																						
33	29		301								Roland	Yes, milady?																						
34	30		301								Luna	Please don't fool around too long with my sister and her friends. You know you have better things to do than that.
