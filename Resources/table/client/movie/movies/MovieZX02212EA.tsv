3	3		301			DialogEnable						After noticing the situation inside the tower, Harley Jo and Yata have extended the extraction points further inward, finally reuniting with all of you just now.																						
4	4		301									Following Harley Jo and Yata, everyone inside retreats according to the extraction points they established. The sea of Hetero-Sapien remains around the area speaks silently of what the two have encountered.																						
5	5		301									The enemies' howls rise from within the tower. Despite the retreat being incomplete, Hans knows he can no longer wait.																						
6	7		301									He pulls the trigger of the Longinus Arsenal. In a few minutes, the most powerful weapon humankind has invented will bring its judgment from the sky, annihilating all enemies.																						
7	8		301									And yet, the signal from the trigger has not been sent. There can only be two possible reasons: either the bit domain nodes are destroyed, or the nodes have malfunctioned.																						
8	9		201							1	500370																							
9	10		301							1	Hans	...	1																					
10	11		301									Looking at his terminal, Hans can see the nodes securely planted, meaning they have not been destroyed. Instead, they are not working because they have malfunctioned from the effect of the Hive Mother and the twins.																						
11	12		301									There is only one way to solve this. Someone has to return to the nodes and calibrate them manually.																						
12	13		301									Realizing that, Hans puts the trigger back inside his coat and looks at Simon and Harley Jo, who are helping the rest to retreat.																						
13	14		301								Hans	Harley Jo. Yata and you have the highest mobility. You two are in charge of bringing the sample back to Babylonia after we're back on the ground.	1

16	17		301							1	Harley Jo	Roger. Yata and I have just assembled a portable rocket. Once we're outside the range of the park's surface-to-air artillery, we will use it to deliver the sample immediately.	2																					
17	18		301								Hans	Vanessa will be instrumental in helping you guys retreat from the Hetero-Sapiens in the park. Once you're on the ground and regrouped, follow her orders.	1																					
18	19		301								Harley Jo	Understood. I'll let her know.	2																					
19	20		301								Hans	Protect Simon on your way out. 【kuroname】 is dying, so Simon is the only one who can protect the Constructs from being infected. It all depends on him whether all the Constructs can get out of this place in one piece.	1																					
20	21		202							1	2				1																			
21	22		301									Taking on the responsibility as the sole person to stabilize all the Constructs, Simon leans on a Construct next to him, wiping off the nosebleed from being fatigued.

26	27		201							1	500370																							
27	28		301							1	Hans	There's something wrong with the bit domain nodes. They require manual calibration from someone with commandant clearance.	1																					
28	29		301								Hans	I'll stay behind and finish my mission, making sure that the Longinus Arsenal hits the Hetero-Hive Mother and ends its reign inside this forest.	1																					
29	30		201							1	500028																							
30	31		301							1	Construct Captain	No, Commander! It's too dangerous for you to go alone. I'll come with you.	1																					
31	32		201							1	500370																							
32	33		301							1	Hans	Enough!	1																					
33	34		301									Hans scolds the Construct next to him.																						
34	35		301								Hans	None of the commandants here can protect the Constructs from being infected with the Hive Mother and the twins present apart from Simon and 【kuroname】.	1																					
35	36		301								Hans	Going back this way will only make you my burden.	1																					
36	37		301									Hans stresses his words when he says "burden," ensuring that everyone present understands where he stands.																						
37	38		201							1	500373																							
38	39		301							1	Harley Jo	But...	1																					
39	40		201							1	500370																							
40	41		301							1	Hans	There is no "but." I've fought more wars since the Golden Age than the miles you've walked.	1																					
41	42		301								Hans	Are you questioning your superior? Questioning my ability to return from the gates of hell?	1																					
42	43		201							1	500028																							
43	44		301							1	Construct Captain	Still...	1																					
44	45		201							1	500370																							
45	46		301							1	Hans	If you still feel the weight of your duty as a soldier, then you will finish your mission.	1																					
46	47		301								Hans	I will finish mine and initiate the Longinus Arsenal, and you will finish yours and escort the sample.	1																					
47	48		301								Hans	That's how we don't fail this uniform.	1																					
48	49		201							1	500362																							
49	50		301							1	Simon	Chief Commander...	1																					
50	51		201							1	500370																							
51	52		301							1	Hans	I will be back. Trust me.	1

56	57		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Walking alone, Hans no longer has to face the Hetero-Sapiens, most of whom are drawn to other locations due to the previous fights. Now, he is facing the purest malice from the Punishing Virus—infection.																						
57	58		401							2	716																							
58	59		301									The virus concentration inside the tower is growing exponentially. The protective suit Hans is wearing has reached its limit long ago.																						
59	60		402							716																								
60	61		301									He removes the earpiece so that the repeating warnings do not interrupt his thoughts.																						
61	62		301									Right now, his mind is sharper and more active than it has ever been.																						
62	63		301									Move forward.																						
63	64		301									He walks straight toward the bit domain node that requires his manual calibration.																						
64	65		301									That is his mission, his duty. His unwavering belief as a soldier.

71	72		301									His organs, having gone through multiple enhancement surgeries over the years, started to show worrying symptoms a few months ago. Now those symptoms are getting worse, sending immense pain to his brain.																						
72	73		301									With the pain that can topple the toughest giant, Hans keeps himself awake.																						
73	74		301									He wipes the blood seeping out of the corner of his eyes with his hand so that his vision is not obstructed.																						
74	75		301									As a habit, his hand wipes past the corner of his mouth after that.																						
75	76		301								Hans	Hah...	1																					
76	77		301									Even when he hates to admit it, the rise of the corners of his mouth reveals the joy Hans is feeling right now.																						
77	78		301									He knows exactly why he is so ecstatic.																						
78	79		301									Because, as a soldier, he is not lying on a hospital bed somewhere on Babylonia, with tubes plugging into his body as he experiences the last moments of his life.																						
79	80		301									Instead, he is spilling his last drop of blood on the battlefield, fighting to meet his end.																						
80	81		301									His body will not be perfectly preserved in a coffin covered with flowers and adornments, waiting to be revered and praised.																						
81	82		301									No, he will lie on the frontline, all alone, with no medals to tell his story, save for the one on his chest, a blossoming flower dried from his own blood—that is the best honor he can ever get.																						
82	83		301									Hans has never questioned his initial choices on the countless nights after the Great Evacuation.																						
83	84		301									He will not, and cannot doubt his life because of shame.																						
84	85		301									That would be him betraying the past and failing humanity.																						
85	86		301									Having survived, he has to spend his life to its fullest. He must make it worth it.

121	126		301									From an opening of the tower, Hans sees the starry night sky.

128	133		301									He has not forgotten the glory of being a soldier. He has sworn to put out all fires that threaten humanity.																						
129	134		301									Hans has not stopped at traitorous friends, ravaging Corrupted, deadly natural disasters, and he is not stopping now.																						
130	135		301									He is a great soldier and a role model in the army, so he suppresses all his feelings, burying them deep inside.
