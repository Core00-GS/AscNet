23	23		301									With mud on his face, the refugee cowers in terror in the corner, watching the dark shadows gradually approaching him.																						
24	24		301									Three armed Scavengers stand in a circle and point their weapons at him.

28	28		301							1	Beardy	Who would've thought. What makes you think you can steal from the likes of us?	2																					
29	29		301								Kordes	Watch out. Look at his bandages. He's probably showing symptoms of corruption.	3																					
30	30		301								Zack	Come on, see what else we can find from this guy. We gotta run.	1																					
31	31		301								Zack	We're at least four or five days of walk away from the nearest conservation area, and it would be very difficult to travel during the night. We can't afford to waste our time here.	1

34	34		301							1	???	W-wait! I... I have stuff I can give you! Don't k-kill me!	1																					
35	35		301									Escaping the hand of the Scavenger who was about to tear his cloak, the raggedly dressed refugee trembles as he empties the contents of his backpack.																						
36	36		301									The things in his bag drop one after another. A few tins and hardtacks fall next to the Scavengers' feet. There is also a small unused bandage roll, alcohol, several magazines, a picture frame with a blurred photo, and a broken walkie-talkie.

40	40		301							1	Beardy	Hmph, looks like you still got a lot there.	2																					
41	41		301									Beardy kicks the frame away and, after checking them, puts the food, bandages, and magazines in his backpack before he gives a wink to Zack.																						
42	42		301									Zack nods and hits the refugee's arms, which are holding his bag tightly, hard with the butt of his gun. The refugee cries in pain and lets go of the bag.																						
43	43		301									Beardy immediately picks up the bag that falls at his feet with a dagger. It's a heavy bag. He sneers and drops the bag to the ground. Inside the bag is an iron box wrapped tightly in cloth and covered with a large brown stain.

46	46		301							1	???	Ugh...!	1																					
47	47		301									Seeing them notice that he was trying to hide something, the refugee trembles and lowers his head even more.

49	49		201							2	500140		-400																					
50	50		301							1	Beardy	Come on, fella. Still holding out on us?	2																					
51	51		301								Zack	What's this? Come over here and open it yourself. No funny business.	1																					
52	52		202							1	2				1																			
53	53		301									The refugee immediately crawls over, reaching out to open the seal on the edge of the iron box. His hands are wrapped in soiled bandages and his fingertips keep slipping from the edge of the box.																						
54	54		301									Seeing the refugee's hesitant and clumsy appearance, Zack gives an impatient grunt.																						
55	55		201							1	500384																							
56	56		301							1	???	S... Sorry... I hurt my hand. I'll open it right away... right away.	1																					
57	57		301									The seal is picked off little by little, and the iron box opens with a click, revealing the contents.																						
58	58		301									After the white fog formed by the cold air dissipates, the Scavengers see three complete doses of serum lying in the grooves of the iron box. It even comes with a syringe, on which the logo of the World Government is clearly visible.

61	61		201							3	500139		-600																					
62	62		301							1	Beardy	Zackpot... Look what we got here. It's serum. Zack, you...	2																					
63	63		301								Zack	Shut up.	1																					
64	64		301								Kordes	...And not just any serum. This is a World Government symbol, and it's a special military serum, which is more effective than the civilian one.	3																					
65	65		301								Zack	...It's also rarer, and even we don't have access to it.	1																					
66	66		301							1	"Beardy"	Such a nice little treasure you got here, and you try to steal our supplies? Is it true that people die for money and birds die for food?	2																					
67	67		301								Zack&Kordes	……	1	3																				
68	68		301									Despite accidentally ridiculing everyone present, Beardy is unaware of it. He just sighs and puts the serum into his own bag.																						
69	69		202							1	2	3			1																			
70	70		301									Zack ignores his mentally incompetent companions, squats down next to the trembling refugee and speaks quietly.																						
71	71		201							1	500136																							
72	72		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Zack	Tell us. Where'd you get it?	1																					
73	73		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Zack	The CPF?	1																					
74	74		301									The refugee vigorously nods, and subtly tries to move to the side.																						
75	75		201							1	500384																							
76	76		301							1	???	There's a forest park nearby. T-there's the CPF. No one's there.	1																					
77	77		301								???	There's tons of supplies there... There's a lot more in a giant crate. It has the World Government's logo. B-but it's too heavy. I-I couldn't carry it...	1																					
78	78		301									The refugee's words were like telling a group of travelers wandering the desert about a nearby oasis. Too coincidental yet too alluring, the trio pauses in silent contemplation.																						
79	79		301									Someone speaks up after a while.																						
80	80		201							1	500136																							
81	81		301							1	Zack	...What do you guys think?	1																					
82	82		201							1	500140		400																					
83	83		201							2	500139		-400																					
84	84		301							1	Kordes	Something's fishy here. A well-supplied place like that would have been raided already.	2																					
85	85		301								Kordes	...But if there really are a lot of supplies like he said, I think it's worth checking out. We're running low as is.	2																					
86	86		301								Beardy	Are you sure? Even if those supplies do exist, can we really get them? What if it's a trap?	1																					
87	87		301								Beardy	We got similar info about the reconstruction supplies dumped by a group, remember? You insisted to go and check it out!	1																					
88	88		301								"Beardy"	What happened when we got there? Nothing but that damn Red Tide and crazy idiots who jumped into it. We were a man down, and Zack almost...	1																					
89	89		301								Kordes	But Zack is still alive. And because we passed City 075 on the way out, we got the news about the refugee transfer and the establishment of a conservation area in Babylonia.	2																					
90	90		301								Kordes	If you hadn't been taking your sweet *** time on the way there, we may have made it in time for the last transport craft.	2																					
91	91		301								"Beardy"	You think that was MY fault?!	1																					
92	92		301								"Beardy"	Ha! If it wasn't for the supplies I found, we wouldn't even BE here!	1																					
93	93		202							1	2				1																			
94	94		201							1	500136																							
95	95		301							1	Zack	Knock it off.	1																					
96	96		301									Irritated, Zack commands them to stop. "Beardy" is just about to muster up a retort, but shuts his mouth upon seeing Zack's expression. He grips the handle of his knife hanging down at his side even more tightly.

100	100		301									Zack pulls out a map and spreads it out on the floor.																						
101	101		301								Zack	Where exactly is the CPF?	1																					
102	102		301								???	Go northwest from here and then down the road, and you'll find it soon!	2																					
103	103		301								???	I swear! I'm not lying!	2																					
104	104		301									Zack's fingers cross the map in the direction refugee is pointing, then stops at a place marked as "Pulia Forest Park".																						
105	105		201							2	500140		-400																					
106	106		301							1	Zack	... Central Purification Filter 040. Depending on our travel speed and road conditions, it should take us about three to four days to get there.	1																					
107	107		301								Zack	He wasn't lying about the location of the tower.	1																					
108	108		301								Beardy	You're not seriously thinking of going, are you?	2																					
109	109		301								Zack	With the supplies we have now, we wouldn't make it to the conservation area. Kordes, how many medical supplies do we have now?	1																					
110	110		201							2	500139		-400																					
111	111		301							1		Kordes hesitates for a moment before speaking again.																						
112	112		301								Kordes	We used our last vial of serum yesterday.	2																					
113	113		301								Kordes	...Recently, we've been taking too many detours to avoid high concentration areas. We've used too much of our supplies this week.	2																					
114	114		301								Zack	Even if there are no supplies in the CPF, we can cross the park in this direction and continue north to find the conservation area.	1																					
115	115		301								Zack	From the moment we left the base, there was no turning back.	1																					
116	116		301									Zack puts the map back into his bag, stands up, and aims his gun at the refugee who had quietly stepped back several meters.																						
117	117		301								Zack	You lead the way.	1																					
118	118		202							1	2				1																			
119	119		301									Seeing the dark muzzle aimed right at him, the refugee instantly puts his hands up as if struck by lightning. But after hearing Zack, he shows obvious hesitation.																						
120	120		201							1	500140																							
121	121		301							1	Beardy	What's wrong? Think we got all day? Move it.	1																					
122	122		203							1	0.25	400																						
123	123		201							2	500384		-400																					
124	124		301							1	???	There... Over there...	2																					
125	125		301								???	But there are monsters. And Corrupted. It's dangerous...	2																					
126	126		301									The refugee shivers and points into the distance, where a faint green line beyond the city is seen far across the horizon.																						
127	127		301								???	That park... has a lot of Corrupted in it.	2																					
128	128		201							1	500136		400																					
129	129		301							1	Zack	If that's the case, how'd you get out?	1																					
130	130		301								???	I...	2																					
131	131		201							1	500140		400																					
132	132		301							1	Beardy	What a wimp... We've taken all his supplies. I don't think he'll survive on his own. Shall we rub him out here?	1																					
133	133		301									"Beardy" spins a knife around his fingers and grins.																						
134	134		301								???	D-don't! Don't kill me! I, I know how to get there! I've been there several times. I'm the only one who knows a safe route!	2																					
135	135		201							1	500136		400																					
136	136		301							1	Zack	Any funny games, and you know what'll happen next.	1																					
137	137		301								Zack	Clean up and prepare to move out, "Beardy". Also, take out all of the supplies. Don't think I didn't see that.	1																					
138	138		201							2	500140		-400																					
139	139		301							1	Beardy	Okay.	2																					
140	140		301									Beardy takes the ammo and medical supplies from his bag, hands them to Zack and Kordus respectively, then shows Zack the contents of the bag.																						
141	141		301								"Beardy"	That's all. I'm in charge of all the food. Don't say I'm being selfish.	2																					
142	142		301								Zack	Alright, let's hit the road, and...	1																					
143	143		301									Zack furrows his eyebrows.																						
144	144		301								Zack	What's your name?	1																					
145	145		201							2	500384		-400																					
146	146		301							1	???	Huh?	2																					
147	147		301								Zack	I said, what's your name?	1																					
148	148		301									Who cares about the name of a dirty thief. No one seems to ever ask him this question, catching him off guard.																						
149	149		301								???	I...	2																					
150	150		301									Like attempting to swallow with a dry mouth, the refugee answers with some difficulty.																						
151	151		301								???	Rolmo... My name's Rolmo.	2																					
152	152		301								Zack	Alright, Rolmo. You take the lead.	1																					
153	153		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Zack	Try to escape, we'll see which is faster—your legs or my bullet.	1																					
154	154		202							1	2				1																			
155	155		201							1	500384																							
156	156		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		Forced to take the lead, the refugee hunches forward. With his back to the Scavengers, the timid look on his face disappears without a trace.																						
157	157		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryWhiteNew.prefab	2																							
158	158		201							1	500366																							
159	159		301							1	???	……	1																					
160	160		301									His dichromatic eyes obscured in shadow narrow slightly as if "Rolmo" is lost in contemplation.																						
161	161		301									Normally, Scavengers act in a group. Their supplies are distributed evenly and they can decide what to do with their own rations.																						
162	162		301									But these people ask different men to keep different supplies. One person keeps all the medical supplies, one keeps all the food, and one keeps all the weapons and ammunition.																						
163	163		301									This way, the group forms an invisible chain from which no one can break away. Otherwise, they cannot live on just one form of supplies.																						
164	164		301									In the apocalyptic wasteland with no stable access to materials, losing food means difficulty in moving forward. Losing medical supplies means endless pain and infections. Losing weaponry means the lack of defense when surrounded by Corrupted. Whichever it is, death would be the final destination.																						
165	165		301									Everyone has the lifeblood of the team, which makes it impossible for them to turn against each other and leave the team by themselves.																						
166	166		301									This isn't stupid or clever, but one thing for certain is that they couldn't trust each other from the start. So they came up with this way to restrain each other.																						
167	167		301									Such a classic configuration, Roland can only imagine how the team will end up.
