3	3		301			DialogEnable						Nanami stands at the library's entrance.																						
4	4		301									In fact, it is not exactly a library. At the end of the empty, clean space is a large window that spans from floor to ceiling. The stars outside make Nanami realize she is inside a spacecraft.																						
5	5		301									She walks in and sees some picture books, fictions and even video game disks arranged nicely on the shelf.																						
6	6		301									Before she knows it, Nanami already has her hands on those things. She recognizes some of them but not others, yet they pique her interest all the same.

8	8		301							1	Nanami	Wow... "War of Steel Robots BX Invincible Feat.DK-Hyper Î±+++ Year Edition"!	1																					
9	9		301								Nanami	And there is "Cardman Rider and the New World", too!	1																					
10	10		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					As she walks further, the view outside the window has caught her attention.

13	13		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Nanami puts her hands on the window, gazing at the sky.																						
14	14		301									The silently glowing stars look incredibly close. At 10 o'clock is a particularly bright band of stars. Countless stars move slowly at different speeds above her like a flowing river.																						
15	15		301									Unlike the virtual scenes she saw earlier, the starry sky in front is more of a breathtaking beauty.																						
16	16		301									Bright and dark stars that glitter in space, the ancient fusion that took place billions of years ago, the majestic and lengthy history of the universe light years away all flow by quietly. All those moments are captured in her eyes, blinking, flickering, like an ancient prophecy.																						
17	17		301								Nanami	How beautiful...																						
18	18		301									Nanami cannot help but start searching among them.

23	23		301								??	You are looking for Earth, aren't you?																						
24	24		301									Nanami quickly turns around but sees no one in the vast space except herself.																						
25	25		301								??	Oops, I forgot. Sorry if I was rude.																						
26	26		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Nanami blinks. There seems to be something standing in front of her. It has a vague shape that resembles a human.

29	28		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		Soon, a hologram of a girl with long, silver-gray hair appears in the air.																						
30	29		301								Girl	Hello, Nanami.																						
31	30		301								Nanami	Hello to you too. Why did you summon Nanami here? And where is this place?	1																					
32	31		301								Girl	Nothing. I just want to talk to you.																						
33	32		301								Girl	I have been waiting for you. Do you like this library?																						
34	33		301								Nanami	I can give it a 90 out of 100. Is this for me?	1																					
35	34		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Girl	Indeed. Take a seat, we have lots of time.																						
36	39		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The girl sits down at a table by the window. Nanami also takes a seat.																						
37	40		301								Girl	This is DeLorean-Discovery. We are sailing in space at the third cosmic speed.																						
38	41		301								Nanami	Where are you then? Why are you talking to me like this?	1																					
39	42		301								Girl	For some reason, I cannot meet you in person. The original "me" is in the center of this spacecraft.																						
40	43		204							1	7																							
41	44		301								Nanami	What does that mean?	1																					
42	45		301								Girl	Discovery itself is a magnificent body. I am it, it is me.																						
43	46		301									As the girl explains, she casts a hologram on the table: a large machine stands in a dark room, with numerous cables and tubes connected to its center. Nanami sees a vague figure wrapped inside.																						
44	47		301								Girl	Of course, I'm not alone here.																						
45	48		301									The hologram changes, showing both humanoid and non-humanoid machines walking in the hall.																						
46	49		301								Girl	Together we are looking for new possibilities in the universe.																						
47	50		204							1	14																							
48	51		301								Nanami	...I see.	1																					
49	52		301								Girl	We've been talking about me. I want to hear something about you.																						
50	53		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Girl	As far as I know, you are going through something special...																						
51	54		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Time flies as they chat with each other.																						
52	55		301									The girl's face begins to blur before she even finishes her last word.																						
53	56		301								Nanami	H-hold on...	1																					
54	57		301								Girl	It's time to say goodbye.

57	61		301									She looks at the hologram on the table. Light spots form the image of a planet. It is white, pristine, running in the deep of a galaxy and awaiting her arrival.																						
58	62		301									The air around her is twisting. The girl's body descends into infinite darkness, and is almost about to dissolve. 																						
59	63		301									But she looks so familiar. Even when she only has a vague silhouette left, Nanami still feels something nostalgic that almost makes her cry.																						
60	64		301									She slowly reaches out for it. An amazing force is pulling her hand like a magnet.																						
61	65		301									The force exists between her and the ghost-like "human", as if they are attracted to each other until time and space give way to them. The poles of the world overlap on their fingertips.																						
62	66		301									Just when Nanami is almost touching "her"...
