7	7		301							1	Chrome	You've been working hard, Asimov. How is the test data?	2																					
8	8		301								Asimov	You've reached a high enough degree of synchronization and proficiency to pass the test.	1																					
9	9		204							1	8																							
10	10		301								Asimov	But the core issues still haven't been addressed.	1																					
11	11		301									Asimov clenches his fists and closes his eyes. Chrome has never seen such an expression on this seemingly infallible scientific genius.																						
12	12		301								Chrome	Is there anything I can do to help?	2																					
13	13		204							1																								
14	14		301									Asimov grabs the mug on the table, swallows a mouthful of cold coffee, and shakes his head in a trance.																						
15	15		301								Asimov	This frame uses technology similar to that of Lucia: Plume.	1																					
16	16		301								Chrome	I know.	2																					
17	17		202							1	2				1																			
18	18		301									Before signing the agreement and applying to participate in the experiment, he fully understood the principles and risks of the project.																						
19	19		301									But Asimov's expression does not stem from the achievements of his research, but rather the costs.																						
20	20		301									Lucia was reborn as Plume after sustaining life-threatening injuries during the battle of Kowloong. Asimov had explained that she lost her original memory during the upload process. Despite having a backup of her memory, re-integration would have only caused a sense of alienation.																						
21	21		301									Plume has not had any issues since then, and Lucia's memory still remains intact.																						
22	22		301									Recently, she seems to have completely regained familiarity toward her memories and has gradually overcome the impacts of the transfer process.																						
23	23		301									The original agreement stated that there might be similar risks, but the main purpose of this experiment was to resolve the negative effects of frame transferal.

25	25		201							2	500155		-450																					
26	26		301							1	Chrome	Are you referring to the risks mentioned in the plan?	2																					
27	27		301								Asimov	No, the plan only mentioned the hypotheses we made at the beginning of the experiment.	1																					
28	28		301								Asimov	But as this experiment continues, I've discovered that the technology still has a lot of issues that remain unsolved.	1																					
29	29		301								Asimov	To give you a simple idea, imagine filling a bottle with rocks, then casting it out at sea.	1																					
30	30		301								Asimov	Even though your M.I.N.D., aka the "bottle," is stable and able to retain all of these "rocks," when uploaded into the frame, it would be inoperable, much like how the bottle would sink to the ocean floor.	1																					
31	31		301								Asimov	Lucia was able to synchronize with the frame without any adjustments due to additional data from...	1																					
32	32		301								Asimov	Cough‚Äîbecause the data is compatible with her, just like the frame itself.	1																					
33	33		301								Chrome	Additional data?	2																					
34	34		301								Asimov	That's classified. I'm not at liberty to say much more.	1																					
35	35		202							1	2				1																			
36	36		301									However, Asimov knows that specialized frames are "special" not only because they are created on the basis of all the data accumulated by Gray Raven thus far...																						
37	37		301									...But also because they contain data from the Ascendant‚ÄîAlpha.																						
38	38		301									When Lucia earnestly returned to the battlefield, she failed to ask the question that was deliberately hidden.																						
39	39		301									"‚ÄîWhere did you get this Ascendant data?"																						
40	40		301									The answer was out of hope to put an end to this calamity, but was also to give rise to human strife.

42	42		201							2	500155		-450																					
43	43		301							1	Asimov	Ever since Lucia was uploaded into the frame, the Science Council has been collecting various data on Plume.	1																					
44	44		301								Asimov	We've made numerous adjustments, which allow you to safely establish a virtual link.	1																					
45	45		301								Asimov	However, only you can do it. That's because your specialized Inver-Device and M.I.N.D. are inherently more stable.	1																					
46	46		301								Asimov	That's why I invited you to participate in this program.	1																					
47	47		301								Chrome	What risks are we most likely to face now?	2																					
48	48		301								Asimov	Your M.I.N.D. is likely to experience any number of serious cognitive side effects.	1																					
49	49		301								Asimov	Common symptoms aside, you may experience M.I.N.D. deviation much like how the bottle would sink to the bottom of the ocean. If it were to continue any further... you may experience M.I.N.D. corruption.	1																					
50	50		301								Asimov	At that point, you would lose control. Anything goes after that.	1																					
51	51		301								Asimov	If you don't know what that's like, you can speak with „Äêkuroname„Äë later.	1																					
52	52		301								Chrome	It's fine. I've read about it in the reference materials. There's no sense in bothering the Gray Raven Commandant.	2																					
53	53		301								Asimov	However, since your specialized Inver-Device has allowed you to serve as the commandant of Strike Hawk, you're not the only one at risk.	1																					
54	54		301								Asimov	If your M.I.N.D. experiences any deviation or corruption, any squad member linked with you will also be affected.	1																					
55	55		301								Chrome	...	2																					
56	56		301								Asimov	Until we resolve whatever is making your M.I.N.D. susceptible to corruption, I can't let you use this frame.	1																					
57	57		301									Chrome glances back at Asimov, who is looking at a large stack of files, ruminating about how to improve the frame.																						
58	58		301								Chrome	I'm no scientist, but I think...	2																					
59	59		301								Chrome	If the core problem is data compatibility with my M.I.N.D., or as you put it, rocks sinking the bottle...	2																					
60	60		301								Chrome	Would it be possible to attach additional equipment to isolate it in parallel with the bottle?	2																					
61	2001		204							1	8																							
62	61		301								Asimov	...	1																					
63	62		204							1	7																							
64	63		301									Asimov thinks for a moment, then stands up as if to say, "Eureka!", then walks to the side of the lab and begins looking up something on the terminals.

67	65		301							1	Asimov	Rosetta...	1																					
68	66		301								Asimov	The research data from her transfer between the centaur and humanoid frame...!	1																					
69	67		202							1					1																			
70	68		301									With the terminal's high processing speed, Asimov quickly finds the target file. He pulls up a chair in front of the monitors and begins to work assiduously.																						
71	69		301									Seeing his bleak demeanor begin to reside, Chrome politely dismisses himself.																						
72	70		201							1	500155																							
73	71		301							1	Chrome	I'll get going. Let me know if you need help calibrating the frame.	1																					
74	2003		201							1	500004

84	80		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Once the sound of footsteps outside the lab fades into the distance, Asimov opens an encrypted file on Plume containing "Alpha_data" sent to him early on by "some people."																						
85	81		301									The method, costs, and potential dangers of acquiring such data had been deliberately stricken from the record.																						
86	82		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Perhaps, only when all of this comes to light will the truth behind these "anomalies" finally be revealed.

91	87		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Celica	Hello, Chrome.	1																					
92	88		301									After leaving the closed lab, Chrome receives a notification from Celica on his terminal.																						
93	89		301								Celica	There's been a change to the search and rescue mission. Since it's been assigned on such short notice, time is of the essence.	1																					
94	90		301								Celica	Gather your squad and board the transport craft in forty minutes.	1																					
95	91		301								Celica	Mission details have been uploaded to your terminal. Let me know if you have any questions.	1																					
96	92		301									Chrome opens the mission details and quickly scans the intel. The new mission is to enter the Longinus blast zone to search for abnormalities.																						
97	93		301								Celica	It may appear to be an ordinary recon mission...	1																					
98	94		301								Celica	But after you evacuated, we suddenly detected high Punishing concentration within the area.	1																					
99	95		203							1	0.25	450																						
100	96		201							2	500155		-450																					
101	97		301							1	Chrome	Suddenly?	2																					
102	98		301								Celica	Correct. The specific location and concentration fluctuate greatly.	1																					
103	99		301								Celica	Maybe it's just a false positive caused by various regional and climate factors. Or maybe there's something hiding down there.	1																					
104	100		301								Celica	Considering the potential risks, this mission is best left in good hands.	1																					
105	101		301									Chrome scrolls down the intel log and notices small line of gray text at the bottom: "This task has been transferred from Gray Raven to Strike Hawk."																						
106	102		301								Chrome	This was originally assigned to... Gray Raven?	2																					
107	103		301								Celica	„Äêkuroname„Äë is indisposed and unable to perform missions for the time being.	1																					
108	104		301								Chrome	Have the memory flashbacks put the commandant out of commission?	2																					
109	105		301								Celica	Hm? Um...	1																					
110	106		301									Celica hesitates for a moment before realizing why Chrome would know about it.																						
111	107		301								Celica	Seems like Wanshi sensed something wrong with „Äêkuroname„Äë. Correct, the commandant's condition has something to do with that.	1																					
112	108		301									The phrasing of "something" filled Chrome's mind with doubt, but asking about it directly probably would not elicit a response.																						
113	109		301								Chrome	Understood. I'll rally the team.	2

122	118		301									Due to the risks and restitutes involved with the frame transferal experiment, John Smith had also received a notice as the co-signer.																						
123	119		301								John	Careful, you're playing with fire. You can always back out of the experiment if you need to.	2																					
124	120		301								Chrome	I appreciate the concern, Mr. Smith. I'll be sure to tread carefully, but with great risk comes great reward.	1																					
125	121		301								John	What do you have coming up?	2																					
126	122		301								Chrome	We were reassigned to a mission meant for Gray Raven. I'm going to assemble the team, then proceed to the target.	1																					
127	123		301								John	Gray Raven? Looks like they're in over their heads this time.	2																					
128	124		301								Chrome	Because of the commandant's illness?	1																					
129	125		301								John	From what I've gathered, illness is only an excuse for the commandant to be monitored.	2																					
130	126		301								Chrome	„Äêkuroname„Äë is being monitored...?	1																					
131	127		301								John	Yes, but that's just the start. Gray Raven has a lot of trouble coming their way.	2																					
132	128		301								John	Not only are they dealing with this mysterious illness, they've also got people trying to uncover their past transgressions in order for Gray Raven to be a stepping stone on their road to success.	2																					
133	129		301								Chrome	Past transgressions? Why's that?	1																					
134	130		301								John	These people are planning on using the commandant's condition to put them out of service.	2																					
135	131		301								John	But the commandant still hasn't slipped up, so they have to put their plan on hold.	2																					
136	132		301								John	If „Äêkuroname„Äë keeps this up, they'll try to stop Gray Raven by claiming that they violated military orders, had a private connection with the Ascendant leader, or that they are keeping her whereabouts a secret.	2																					
137	133		301								Chrome	A private connection with the Ascendant leader? No commandant can do that. And I don't believe „Äêkuroname„Äë is harboring the enemy.	1																					
138	134		301								John	It's just a possibility. Apparently, the "Huaxu" in the enemy's hands determined that „Äêkuroname„Äë can resist M.I.N.D. corruption and connect with Ascendants.	2																					
139	135		301								Chrome	...!	1																					
140	136		301								John	After learning this, the enemy specifically asked Gestalt to verify authenticity, and the results were confirmed.	2																					
141	137		301								Chrome	Why did Huaxu think that „Äêkuroname„Äë can connect with Ascendants?	1																					
142	138		301								John	Because the commandant crossed paths with them during the underground Battle of City 075.	2																					
143	139		301								John	The commandant wrote everything down in the mission report, but someone leaked it. Even if the commandant hadn't said anything, these people would've found out one way or another.	2																					
144	140		301								John	If it came to that, falsifying the military report would only exacerbate their crimes.	2																					
145	141		301								Chrome	Who leaked the commandant's mission?	1																					
146	142		301								John	It doesn't matter. Even if you found out who did it, someone else would just take their place.	2																					
147	143		301								John	Their network has penetrated into the very fabric of Babylonia. All the President can do is take every necessary precaution.	2																					
148	144		301								John	There isn't much he can do to prevent leaks. After all, the opposition has other means to implicate them. Not to mention, they occupy numerous irreplaceable positions.	2																					
149	145		301								John	No one knows what the commandant really did. They claim that „Äêkuroname„Äë lost consciousness at the time. Even the Constructs on Gray Raven didn't see Luna leave.	2																					
150	146		301								John	They're still collecting evidence. But based on the current trend, the opposition is deliberately trying to forge evidence to achieve their goals.	2																					
151	147		301								Chrome	How do you know this...?	1																					
152	148		301								John	Working in the political sphere, I have my ways. I am a Smith, after all.	2																					
153	149		301								John	The next Smith will have to learn to piece together fragments of intel and speculation to get the whole picture.	2

156	152		301								Chrome	Where is „Äêkuroname„Äë now?	1																					
157	153		301								John	Do you want to see the commandant?	2																					
158	154		301								Chrome	Yes.	1																					
159	155		301								John	People need to use whatever they can to get rid of any other unnecessary troubles.	2																					
160	156		301								John	I'm telling you all of this intel just to remind you.	2																					
161	157		301								John	I know you're interested in the commandant's potential.	2																					
162	158		301								John	I didn't want to interfere with you being around such an exceptional human, but the squad is already in too deep.	2																					
163	159		301								John	If you get too close to „Äêkuroname„Äë, you'll be monitored and put in the same position.	2																					
164	160		301								John	Just look at the other Gray Ravens. Stay away from them, or else you'll just get caught in the crossfire.	2																					
165	161		301								Chrome	Trust my judgment and way of doing things, Mr. Smith. Even if I see „Äêkuroname„Äë, I won't let them get the best of me.	1

173	169		401							2	1509																							
174	170		301									Under the watchful eyes of soldiers and staff, the airtight door slowly rises up.																						
175	171		301									Blinding light fills the empty room. A human is sitting on the cold and hard seat in the conference room, looking ahead with tired and dull eyes.																						
176	172		301									Someone once joked that uncomfortable chairs can shorten meetings and make them more efficient.																						
177	173		301									But when a person is left to sit on the chair for almost two days, the same cannot be said.																						
178	174		301									Chrome looks around the room quietly. In this clean, tidy and unassuming room, cameras are installed in each of the four corners‚Äîat least, that was all that could be seen with the naked eye.																						
179	175		401							2	1509																							
180	176		301									He steps into the room, and the door slowly lowers. Even though it is just the two of you, neither of you are able to speak freely under such watchful eyes.																						
181	177		301									Looking at the side of your pale and tired face, Chrome quietly clenches his fists. Before he greets you, he notices the projection equipment in the corner.																						
182	178		301									The hazy blue light creates a three-dimensional image of an antique clock with no tick marks or minute hand. There is only an hour hand slowly moving along with each swing of a pendulum.																						
183	179		301									A small line of text below the clock reads: Monitoring Schedule.																						
184	180		301									It is difficult for those who have not experienced it to notice, but one's perception of time is infinitely lengthened by staring at a clock during times of hardship.																						
185	181		301									Before coming here, Chrome had heard that the interval between examinations and treatments was 2 hours during the day and 5 hours at night.																						
186	182		301									Anyone who has worked at the Star of Life knows that this frequency of treatment for patients with serious illnesses is normal.																						
187	183		301									But that is done under the conditions that the patients in "critical conditions" are "looked after without being disturbed," not "monitored in confinement."																						
188	184		301									However, if an appeal is submitted due to the frequency of treatment, the other party would just come up with a series of written terms to prove that they are not violating any rules.																						
189	185		301									The commandant's hardship would be hidden between the lines.																						
190	186		301									Such as, being isolated in this empty room for an extended duration...																						
191	187		301									The blinding light and cold, hard conference chairs making rest nigh impossible...																						
192	188		301									Numerous monitoring equipment in the room... Soldiers and staff pacing outside...																						
193	189		301									The clock without tick marks... The all-too-convenient monitoring interval...																						
194	190		301									Singling out any one of these reasons would give no indication that there is any foul play.																						
195	191		301									No one could complain that the room is too clean and empty, or that the seats are too uncomfortable.																						
196	192		301									But together, this is enough to make life wither away with each swing of the pendulum.

215	211		301									The lengthy interrogation regarding the memory replays and mission details have taken a toll on your voice prior to meeting him. No matter how hard you try, you cannot hide the raspiness in your voice.																						
216	212		301									Chrome quietly walks over and stands in front of the chair. He turns slightly to block the blinding light from above, but the struggle in his eyes becomes all the more apparent.																						
217	213		302								Have a seat.	214	(Stand up)	215																				
218	214	217	301								Chrome	That won't be necessary. I'm just here to talk about the mission.	1																					
219	215		301									Chrome quickly reaches out and gently helps you back into your seat.																						
220	216		301								Chrome	You shouldn't stand up as weak as you are. I'm just here to talk about the mission.	1																					
221	217		301								Chrome	Anyway... Babylonia has detected high fluctuations of Punishing concentration within the Longinus blast zone.	1																					
222	218		301								Chrome	If we can rule out any false positives, there might be something hidden there.	1																					
223	219		301								Chrome	Did you notice anything during the last mission?	1																					
224	220		302								(Explains what happened during the mission)	221																						
225	221		301									Listening to your explanation, Chrome records the main points in his terminal notes and draws detailed areas on the map.																						
226	222		301								Chrome	Thanks for the help. Looks like there might actually be something suspicious there. I'll bring some sensors along.	1																					
227	223		302								(Nods, then continues looking at the clock)	224	Chrome, how much longer do you think I'll be here?	226																				
228	224		301									Chrome puts away his terminal and looks at the blue projection of the pendulum.																						
229	225	229	301								Chrome	„Äêkuroname„Äë, do you know when the pendulum will stop descending?	1																					
230	226		301									For any of the onlookers, this sentence would have no significance.																						
231	227		301									As if understanding the look in your eyes, Chrome shifts his gaze from the pendulum onto you.																						
232	228		301								Chrome	Soon. The pendulum will stop descending soon.	1																					
233	229		302								Descend? What do you mean?	230	When they can't get what they want?	234	Are you the "rat"?	237																		
234	230		301									Saying this, you look into Chrome's eyes and wink.																						
235	231		204							1	1																							
236	232		301								Chrome	Sorry, forget I ever said anything.	1																					
237	233	240	301									Seeing the hint, he smiles.																						
238	234		204							1	1																							
239	235		301									Hearing the hint, he smiles.																						
240	236	240	301								Chrome	Correct. So not much longer.	1																					
241	237		204							1	1																							
242	238		301									Seeing that you got the hint, Chrome smiles and drops his gaze.																						
243	239		301								Chrome	"I'm becoming one."	1																					
244	240		301									After he finishes speaking, the door promptly raises with the clear buzzing of an alarm. Chrome steps back, causing the blinding light to occupy your field of vision.																						
245	241		301								Chrome	Thank you again for your help. Goodbye for now.	1																					
246	242		301									He nods under the staff's watchful eyes, then leaves the empty room.
