3	3		301			DialogEnable						Darkness dissipates, and I awake once more from my slumber.																						
4	4		301									This body no longer requires sleep, but I still try to keep to the normal schedule of humans.																						
5	5		301									Grinding gears reverberate in my ears. Making my way through this dark path through the stratum, I arrive at a familiar city that should have died out during the Golden Age.																						
6	6		301									The survivors of the battle built this unknown "cemetery" with bricks and tiles of the KCC.																						
7	7		301									It rests peacefully under the Kowloong Metropolis, where it should remain undisturbed.																						
8	8		301									An artificial sun hangs above this underground complex, creating a day and night cycle for the humans that reside here.																						
9	9		301									Faint blue shadows stroll in the street. They are the masters here. Several groups gather here talking amongst each other.																						
10	10		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					As I walk along the path, my surroundings distort momentarily before a familiar face appears next to me.

14	14		201							1	500150																							
15	15		301							1	Qu	I have no reason not to accept. We must understand what each party seeks to gain.	1																					
16	16		201							1	500243																							
17	17		301							1	Bai Gui	Yes, but...	1																					
18	18		201							1	500150																							
19	19		301							1	Qu	Don't worry. If anything were to happen to me, then the last person with access to this place will be gone. Isn't it safer this way?	1																					
20	20		301								Qu	Of course, I will not allow for any accidents. After all, my mission is not over yet.	1																					
21	21		201							1	500243																							
22	22		301								Bai Gui	That's...	1																					
23	23		201							1	500150																							
24	24		301							1	Qu	As the Supreme, it's my duty to provide shelter for my people and undertake risks on their behalf.	1

32	31		301									As I say this, I hear Bai Gui's voice all around me.																						
33	32		301								Bai Gui	I know. The people of Kowloong all know.																						
34	33		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					After saying farewell to Bai Gui, I walk aimlessly along the path. My vision module scans the buildings in front of me. Resting my hand on the guardrail, I close my eyes and follow it as my guide, letting memories fill my M.I.N.D.

38	37		301								Martial Arts Instructor	I expect nothing less from Lady Qu. You mastered the glaive in just a week, but now we can't find you a worthy opponent.																						
39	38		201							1	500220																							
40	39		301							1	Qu	I owe it to your guidance.	1																					
41	40		202							1					1																			
42	41		301								Martial Arts Instructor	You're too kind. I wasn't expecting such an assignment from the Pulao Crew after my retirement. It's our honor to have an opportunity to train you in our dojo.																						
43	42		301			RImgBg1Shake					???	Argh!																						
44	43		301								Flustered Male Voice	Stop! He already forfeited after you broke his arm! Why continue to attack?!																						
45	44		301									The shouting from next door interrupts Qu and the instructor's exchange. Hearing this, the instructor rushes over. Qu puts away the training equipment, and follows the instructor to the corridor.																						
46	45		301									In the corridor, Qu sees Villier walking out of the room next door. He pats his clothes as he walks out, as if covered in filth.																						
47	46		201							1	500220																							
48	47		301							1	Qu	Medic, Training Room 307.	1																					
49	48		202							1					1																			
50	49		301									Thirty seconds later, the elevator rings. Several medical staff wearing white robes exit with various medical equipment and file into Training Room 307.																						
51	50		301									A pale old man in a blue robe wheels out the elevator on his wheelchair accompanying the medical staff. The exposed scars on his torso indicate that he has had a traumatic experience.																						
52	51		301									After the medics close the training room door, Villier stands beside Qu and salutes the man in front of her.																						
53	52		201							1	500215

56	55		301								???	Villy, I don't want to blame you. I want to thank you.																						
57	56		301									The man's hoarse voice sounded like a gust of torrential wind ripping fabric to pieces. Such a voice seemed impossible for human vocal cords to create.																						
58	57		201							1	500215	5																						
59	58		301							1	Villier	I told you a thousand times. Stop calling me Villy. My name is Villier now!	1

61	60		301								???	(Chuckles)																						
62	61		301								???	There are some things you just can't get rid of.

66	65		301								???	Alright, you two get going now.																						
67	66		301								???	I just came to meet an ol' friend today. I figured I'd let you know that you can begin studying the next course.

71	70		202							1	2				1																			
72	71		301									Qu and Villier salute and proceed toward the elevator. Just as they pass the wheelchair, the man speaks again with his hoarse voice.																						
73	72		301								???	Still remember what you were taught last class?																						
74	73		201							1	500215																							
75	74		301							1	Villier	You mean the Imperial Doctrine? Want me to recite it for you?	1																					
76	75		202							1					1																			
77	76		301								???	That won't be necessary.																						
78	77		201							1	500215																							
79	78		301							1	Villier	The doctrine only defines one central dogma. Imperial learning is only a political tool of mankind. We should not restrict ourselves too much; results are of utmost priority.	1																					
80	79		201							1	500220																							
81	80		301							1	Qu	Do not be swayed by emotions. Instead, act accordingly to the situation at hand. Grace should be given with purpose.	1																					
82	81		202							1					1																			
83	82		301								???	That's right.																						
84	83		301									The man chuckles at Qu and Villier's answers. Pressing a button on his wheelchair, he proceeds to the end of the corridor.																						
85	84		301								???	You both have embodied these principles during your recent public speeches. You bring hope to those in despair and impose sanctions on your opponents. Keep it up. The family looks favorably upon you.																						
86	85		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				???	As others have said, you two are the most capable members of our family.																						
87	88		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory237.png																								
88	86		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Qu and Villier walk out of the dojo. Qu stands quietly as she waits for the transport craft. Villier looks back at the dojo behind him.																						
89	89		201							1	500215																							
90	90		301							1	Villier	How many times is this?	1

92	92		201							2	500220		400																					
93	93		301							1	Qu	Counting is meaningless. It may have caused a disturbance, but we got the job done for our family.	2																					
94	94		301								Villier	Yeah, just the two of us.	1																					
95	95		301								Qu	We were raised to use our surroundings.	2																					
96	96		301								Villier	Hmph, good grief.	1																					
97	97		301								Villier	Mutual interests are all that bring people together.	1																					
98	98		301								Villier	Who would've thought that such an unsightly society of mutual exploitation could survive on this planet for so long.	1																					
99	100		301									As the rumble of the transport craft approaches, Villier ends the conversation and turns to face the landing zone.																						
100	500		301								Villier	I hate this.	1																					
101	501		202							1	2																							
102	502		301									However, Qu just stands there looking out at Villier from behind.																						
103	101		201							1	500220																							
104	102		301							1	Qu	...Hate?	1																					
105	103		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Qu	What sort of feeling is hate?	1
