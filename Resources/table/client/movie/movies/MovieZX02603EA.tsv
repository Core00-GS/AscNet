36	36		301									They find some children's toys and candy wraps buried not too deep in the snow.																						
37	37		301									Tracing them, Nanami controls Power to lift up the roof of a collapsed building. They see a short, dark staircase.

55	55		301									The poorly lit room has just the basic facilities, including several steel beds. It is cramped and dark, but quite clean.

76	76		301									Sniper-PK43 quickly walks up and finds a mechanoid with the looks of a female human. She has collapsed to the ground, holding a rusty kitchen knife in her hands and looking at Nanami and Sniper-PK43 with fear in her eyes.																						
77	77		301									Sniper-PK43 quickly searches for the mechanoid in his database, but the database is never updated, nor it is connected to the network. All he can find is a robot nanny produced in the Golden Age with a similar model number.

84	84		203							1	0.25	400																						
85	85		301									It actually seems to work. Still shivering, the mechanoid gradually puts down the knife. She keeps looking between Nanami and Sniper-PK43.

87	87		301			PanelActor2Shake				1	Stranger Mechanoid	Who... are you...	2																					
88	88		301								Nanami	My name is Nanami, and this is Snipey behind me. I'm looking for a human. Have you seen any humans nearby?	1																					
89	89		301								Stranger Mechanoid	...Hu-man?	2																					
90	90		301								Stranger Mechanoid	Right... my child... Can you also help him...?	2																					
91	91		301								Nanami	Huh, is there a child around? Why am I not seeing any?	1																					
92	92		301									Sniper-PK43 shakes his "head." He has not detected any trace of human activities.																						
93	93		301									When talking about her "child", the mechanoid's expression becomes loving but sad.																						
94	94		301								Stranger Mechanoid	I hid him away. It's too cold out there, let alone the Corrupted... I had to do it to protect him.	2																					
95	95		301								Stranger Mechanoid	Maria was supposed to go out and find food for him... But she never came back on that day. I couldn't just leave him alone... He kept telling me he was cold. I must stay with him...	2																					
96	96		301								Nanami	Is this yours?	1																					
97	97		301									Nanami takes out the backpack she found on the Corrupted earlier and shows it to the mechanoid.																						
98	98		301								Stranger Mechanoid	Right... This is it! Maria left with this bag! Where is she? Where is food?	2																					
99	99		204							1	14																							
100	100		301								Nanami	Your friend Maria had left... But there is food inside this backpack! Maria worked very hard for it... You can have it back now.	1																					
101	101		204							1																								
102	102		301									The stranger mechanoid's knife drops to the ground. She takes the backpack with trembling hands and digs out the remaining food.																						
103	103		301								Nanami	Um, I accidentally took a bite of that... But it should be fine!	1																					
104	104		301								Stranger Mechanoid	T-thank... Thank you.	2																					
105	105		301									The mechanoid gets back on her feet. She looks as if she is going to cry, but mechanoids have no tears.																						
106	106		301								Nanami	You're welcome... Can you take us to your child now?	1																					
107	107		301								Stranger Mechanoid	Sure. He is probably still napping... We don't have much food left. If you hadn't come, I would have gone out to look for food myself.	2																					
108	108		202							1	2				1																			
109	109		401							1	36																							
110	110		301									The mechanoid wipes her hand on her apron like a real housewife before taking Nanami and Sniper-PK43 to a corner of the room, where she has built a small tent from fabrics and branches. She carefully lifts open the yellowed fabric, revealing the interior.																						
111	111		301									There is a cot with someone who seems significantly larger than the cot curled up inside, covered by a large, thick military-green coat.																						
112	112		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
113	113		301							1	Sniper	...!	1																					
114	114		401							1	66																							
115	115		301									Before Sniper-PK43 speaks, Nanami has gently lifted up the fabric on the face.																						
116	116		301									But what they are seeing has completely shocked them.																						
117	117		201							1	500472	14																						
118	118		301							1	Nanami	Arrgh...!	1																					
119	119		301									Nanami's hand shakes after seeing the human corpse under. The scarf and coat both slide away, exposing a male body strangely curled up inside the cot.																						
120	120		301								Nanami	What's... this...	1																					
121	121		201							1	500483																							
122	122		301							1	Stranger Mechanoid	Shh. He's sleeping.	1

124	124		301							1	Nanami	This... is not a kid!	1																					
125	125		301									Nanami turns to the mechanoid in shock. She has but a loving look on her face.																						
126	126		202							1					1																			
127	127		401							2	685																							
128	128		301									Sniper-PK43 immediately activates his attack mode, which he has not used for a long time. He points his gun at the stranger mechanoid. Her face is no different from that of a female human, which makes it even more horrifying.																						
129	129		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
130	130		301			PanelActor1Shake				1	Sniper	What have you done? Did you kill him?	1

133	133		301							1	Stranger Mechanoid	What are you talking about... He's all good, isn't he? I can still detect his life signals...	2																					
134	134		301									A twisted confusion climbs up the mechanoid's face. She removes the coat on the cot, revealing a few nestlings lying quietly in the cold, dead body's arms.																						
135	135		301								Stranger Mechanoid	His heart is still beating. He told me that he felt very cold not long ago... So I found him lots of warm clothing...	2																					
136	136		201							1	500470		-400	-350	600																			
137	137		301							1	Sniper	How long is "not long ago"?	1																					
138	138		402							1	36

140	140		202							1	2				1																			
141	141		301									The "woman" looks lost as if nobody has told her the truth before. She stares at the cot that she has put so much effort to protect, trying to figure out what has happened.																						
142	142		201							1	500483																							
143	143		401							1	211																							
144	144		301							1	Stranger Mechanoid	What did I do...? He arrived on a very dark night... I heard him knocking on the door. I had not seen a human for so long... He was badly injured, so Maria and I had been taking care of him...	1																					
145	145		301								Stranger Mechanoid	What happened after? I was able to take good care of kids. I could have taken care of him. But the next evening, he suddenly said he was cold, but his body temperature was very high.	1																					
146	146		301								Stranger Mechanoid	I could not find medicine anywhere... He said he was getting sleepy, so I hugged him for the night. But his heart stopped beating the next morning.	1																					
147	147		301									The mechanoid stares at her hands, completely lost.																						
148	148		301								Stranger Mechanoid	What have I done...? I want him to come back. Why couldn't I take care of him? I was supposed to help him. He was so young and fragile.	1																					
149	149		301									The mechanoid starts to make a twisted, painful crying sound. It could very well be her first time. "Crying" is not loaded in her program, so she can only imitate humans using her instinct, making a hoarse, obnoxious howl.																						
150	150		301								Stranger Mechanoid	I didn't know what to do. I put him in my arms and waited at the window. I lost track of time. Without him, I lost my purpose.	1																					
151	151		301								Stranger Mechanoid	But I once again detected life signals in his body...	1																					
152	152		301									It could be a bird lost in the snow storm. Exhausted, it accidentally broke into the nursery and landed on the warm fabrics covering the body. It made a nest.																						
153	153		301								Stranger Mechanoid	I feel confused...	1																					
154	154		301			PanelActor1Shake						The "woman" helplessly grasps her chest. She keeps asking and pounding herself, as if she wants to beat a soul out of her mechanical body.																						
155	155		301								Stranger Mechanoid	What have I done...? Why...? What's this feeling...?	1																					
156	156		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
157	157		301							1	Sniper	...So this is what happened.	1																					
158	158		301									His maker did not die after falling off the building, but managed to get here. This dark, cramped nursery witnessed the human's final moment.																						
159	159		201							1	500472	14																						
160	160		301							1	Nanami	...	1																					
161	161		301									Nanami wipes the tears away from her cheeks.																						
162	162		301								Nanami	I see...	1																					
163	163		301									Nanami moves closer to the mechanoid on the ground. This time, she puts her hand on the mechanoid's shoulder, gently patting her.																						
164	164		301								Nanami	...	1

173	173		201							1	500470			-350	600																			
174	174		301							1	Sniper	What is this?	1

178	178		201							2	500483		-400																					
179	179		301							1	Nanami	It shows how the human turns into a bird and flies away.	1																					
180	180		301									Nanami holds the mechanoid's hands, wiping away her invisible tears.																						
181	181		301								Nanami	He was worried about you, so he turned into a bird and came back to check on you... That's why you should stop locking yourself up here.	1																					
182	182		301								Stranger Mechanoid	But what should I do...?	2																					
183	183		301								Nanami	Do what you want to do.	1																					
184	184		301								Stranger Mechanoid	There's nothing that I want to do. My only duty is to take care of these children.	2																					
185	185		301								Nanami	No... Touch your heart.	1

187	187		204							1	2																							
188	188		301								Nanami	I feel sorrow here... Just like how you are feeling sad right now, you will be able to feel happiness, excitement, and affection. There must be something in the world that is worth seeking for you, just like how you cherished that human.	1																					
189	189		301									The mechanoid's eyes follow Nanami's hand. They seem to be getting watery, as if she has received a "revelation."

201	201		301									Nanami stands in the snow. The mech's bulky body is right under her feet, but she still feels incredibly small in the vast, overwhelming environment. She listens again but cannot hear any more heart beats.

231	231		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Out of nowhere, a wave of infinite melancholy has taken him as he tries to match the exhausted voice in the recorder to the voice stored in his database.

233	233		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Message	Day 35.																						
234	234		301								Message	I saw a building collapse today. Perhaps the concrete underwent some chemical reaction due to the temperature change. I was... (Static)... patrolling aimlessly when I heard the sound of glass shattering. Not long after that, a window wall snapped and dropped vertically onto the pavement.																						
235	235		301								Message	Afterward, there was like a gentle push from a pair of invisible hands, and the building fell like a domino. I was terrified. It was so difficult to run wearing a protective suit. Shards spattered everywhere, carried by a gust of wind. Fortunately, I was safe.																						
236	236		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Message	I suddenly wondered how long it took the people who lived there to build this towering structure. Nature reclaimed it in but a second. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.

238	238		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Message	I found a nursery from the Golden Age today. You could tell that kids used to sleep and rest here. Now it's empty. I tried to find some supplies for Hank, but had no luck. Still, I found something else...																						
239	239		301								Message	The windows were broken, but the room wasn't without its dwellers. I saw two nests on the windowsill. There seemed to be birds landing there. They brought food and fur, leaving behind bones and feathers. The room still felt slightly alive.																						
240	240		301								Message	Chirp—																						
241	241		301									The birds are chirping loudly.																						
242	242		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Message	Alright, good birdie. I will come back again. Maybe next time I'll bring some leftover soup from the cans.

244	244		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Message	Thanks to Zavier, I managed to fix that bulky machine.																						
245	245		301								Message	For some personal reasons... I asked Zavier to install a personality simulation program on it. The way it speaks now kinda reminds me of Nana. Haha... Not entirely though. Well, I'll just pretend that Nana's with me.																						
246	246		301								Message	I plan to put it on the east side of our site, so it can watch out for wandering Corrupted for us.																						
247	247		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Message	Hank's situation is getting worse day by day. Maybe he should return to Babylonia, at least Star of Life can take care of him up there.																						
248	248		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory458.jpg																								
249	249		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Message	Hank didn't make it. I'm sad. Really sad.																						
250	250		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Message	Zavier wants to leave too. What about the refugees here? What will they do? Rumor has it that Punishing creatures are already getting used to the climate. The war is getting more intense at the frontline. Perhaps I should also apply to be relocated to the area most impacted by the extreme cold weather.

255	255		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						There is a lengthy gap in between filled with random, intermittent static noise. Nanami fast-forwards the message, then pauses and rewinds it when she hears some almost incomprehensible, hoarse sound. It's a few lines of lyrics.																						
256	256		301								Message	"Across the oceans, across the seas..."																						
257	257		301								Message	"Over forests of blackened trees..."																						
258	258		301								Message	"Valleys so still we dare not breathe..."

260	260		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Message	...																						
261	261		301								Message	...Earlier on, I got a message from the frontline. My senior died in battle, and the body was not taken back to Babylonia, but left on Earth forever.																						
262	262		301								Message	I have seen how a civilization collapses over the days on Earth.																						
263	263		301								Message	Birds are migrating. Wild animals start to appear in the abandoned cities. They are slowly getting used to these environments, despite the real culprit being us. The disaster left by humankind has turned into a scab on the earth while nature is repairing everything... Humans once thought they had control over nature, but it was just a naive fantasy.																						
264	264		301								Message	A professor back in F.O.S. said... Scientists in the Golden Age predicted that our culture and history would live on and spread to the edge of the universe through radio waves and broadcasting. One day intelligent life on other planets would find our message: "We're here. This is our civilization."																						
265	265		301								Message	But as the technology develops, scientists in the council have calculated that such radio waves will turn into but noises forever after traveling 2 light years. If their calculation is correct, our message cannot even reach the nearest nova in the Solar System.																						
266	266		301								Message	Ten thousand years later, what can prove that we once lived on this planet and created a great civilization? Steel will rust, concrete will shatter, and books will decay.																						
267	267		301								Message	【kuroname】 once told me that there were always two sides to every story.																						
268	268		301								Message	"Life is more elastic than we think. One day, I may be no longer able to fight, but hope still lives on. All things will rise and fall, including mankind. The path of life shall continue even when I'm gone."																						
269	269		301								Message	...																						
270	270		301								Message	Babylonia has made the decision to evacuate Earth as it is no longer fit for humans to live. But I decided to stay. I decided to expand the path of life on this planet.																						
271	271		301								Message	—I leave no trace of wings in the air, but I am glad I have had my flight.																						
272	272		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Time remaining: 00:00:00.																						
273	273		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The recording has ended, leaving only the static noise behind that silently marks the end of a fairy tale.

275	275		301									The setting sun is reduced to a purple semi-circle on the edge of the city crawling on the frozen plain.																						
276	276		301									The sky is getting dark. Something has pulled Nanami down with ease, shattering her fantasy with cold reality.																						
277	277		301								Nanami	...【kuroname】...?																						
278	278		301									She mumbles the name that only appeared once in the message. Sniper-PK43 cannot see her face and is unable to detect her mood.

280	280		301							1	Sniper	I have gathered all available information. Thank you, Nanami.	1																					
281	281		301								Sniper	We are already free. Without humans, we have no more purpose. She was right.	1

285	285		301									Nanami tries to grab him. Two of them stand at the intersection, face to face. The snowstorm howls between them like an icy gorge.

287	287		301							1	Sniper	I have already found the ending of my maker. There is no other human related to me in this world. Our cooperation can terminate now.	1

295	295		301							1	Sniper	We cannot change anything. Humans are gone.	1																					
296	296		301								Sniper	The only thing I can do now...	1																					
297	297		301								Sniper	Is to carry on the orders that humans set for me.	1																					
298	298		301								Sniper	If there is something you still want to do, you will have to do it yourself.	1																					
299	299		201							1	500472	14																						
300	300		301							1	Nanami	I-if that's true... Even...	1																					
301	301		301									The girl wipes her eyes and raises her head. Looking in her eyes, Sniper-PK43 realizes that she knows his entire life story, but he has no idea about hers.
