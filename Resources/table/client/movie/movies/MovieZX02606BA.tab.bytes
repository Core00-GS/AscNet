3	3		301			DialogEnable						Arctic Route Union. After solving Amberia's berserk problem with Martin and the other bionic mechanoids, Nanami decides to lead the machines onto a new journey.

5	5		301							1	Nanami	Follow the sound of piper Nanami's saw! I'll take you to a new place to live!	1																					
6	6		301									After experiencing the Ever-Winter in Gestalt's simulation, Nanami begins to consciously awaken some machines on her journey.																						
7	7		301									This time, Nanami arrives at the ARU and discovers the seed of awakening there. Acting like Gestalt's Sagemachina, she guides her followers and experiences much with them.																						
8	8		301								Nanami	But it's time for Nanami to move on...	1																					
9	9		301									Realizing something, Nanami waves at Martin.																						
10	10		301								Nanami	Plushie, Nanami suddenly remembers that there is something she must do... so you'll be the one leading everyone forward. I'll look for you guys soon!	1

13	13		301							1	Martin	You just said you'd lead us away. You're already going?	2																					
14	14		301									Nanami scratches her head.																						
15	15		301								Nanami	Hehe... but it's really important! Nanami isn't abandoning you.	1																					
16	16		301									Cheekily, she grins.																						
17	17		301								Nanami	Isn't there a high-power antenna here somewhere? That should work... Nanami is hoping to borrow that!	1																					
18	18		301								Martin	Oh, do you mean that rock...?	2																					
19	19		301									The bear points at a stone pillar erected in the distance that extends underground.																						
20	20		301								Nanami	That's it.	1																					
21	21		301								Martin	What do you need that for?	2																					
22	22		301								Nanami	Nanami needs to find a... friend. There's something I need to ask her.	1																					
23	23		301								Martin	Then let us walk you there.	2																					
24	24		301								Nanami	It's not a good idea to scare the people there. This is Nanami's secret solo adventure!	1																					
25	25		301								Martin	Something so secretive? Alright then... I'll just wish you well.	2																					
26	26		301								Nanami	You too!	1

32	32		301									Somehow, Nanami has broken into the secured base of ARU's experimental high-power antenna. Thumping her chest, she walks alone inside the spacious bunker.																						
33	33		301								Nanami	Alright... this should be it.	1																					
34	34		301									Looking everywhere, Nanami finally finds a cable among the tangled wires of the control panel in the corner.																						
35	35		301								Nanami	This is it...!	1																					
36	36		401							2	1511																							
37	37		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					After connecting the thick cable to the back of her neck, Nanami soon enters sleep mode.

42	42		301			DialogEnable					Gestalt	You're here.																						
43	43		301									She is back in the familiar virtual space. This was where she experienced the Ever-Winter simulation last time.																						
44	44		201							2	500091																							
45	45		301							1	Nanami	Mecha babushka...	2																					
46	46		301									Nanami cuts to the chase.																						
47	47		301								Nanami	Nanami has guided and awakened others like you told me to. I want to run the future simulation again.	2																					
48	48		301								Nanami	You might want to stop me for all kinds of reasons, mecha babushka, but Nanami is certain this time! I need to see the future with my own eyes to know my effort is worth it!	2																					
49	49		301								Gestalt	There's no use stopping you, is there?																						
50	50		301								Gestalt	But, the one called Nanami, I must reiterate once again that the future simulation might cause you irreversible damage.																						
51	51		301								Gestalt	Every future simulation requires deploying all data collected and gathered by the available machines from Gestalts around the globe. Given the computational strain, it can also only be done in real-time.																						
52	52		301								Gestalt	The simulation is so immense that even I cannot stop it at will. You must locate a device that can connect with me in the simulation's digital space.																						
53	53		301								Gestalt	Any damage you receive in the future will also impact your program logic.																						
54	54		301								Gestalt	As the simulation stretches on, redundant data will pile on with nowhere to go. The computational strain on you will also increase.																						
55	55		301								Gestalt	In the same vein, if "that future" becomes more complicated...																						
56	56		204							2	5																							
57	57		301								Nanami	Alright, alright! I get it!	2																					
58	58		301								Nanami	Nanami has done all the preparations! Just do it!	2																					
59	59		301								Gestalt	...If you insist.																						
60	60		204							2																								
61	61		301								Gestalt	The one called Nanami. You are about to enter your second simulation. Confirm?																						
62	62		301								Nanami	Confirm.	2																					
63	63		202							2					1																			
64	64		301								Gestalt	Launching the second world reconstructing simulation program. 5%... 18%... 26%...																						
65	65		301									The surroundings begin to change alongside Gestalt's voice as if being fast-forwarded.
