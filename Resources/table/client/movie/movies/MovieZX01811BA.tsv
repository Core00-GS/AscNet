3	3		301			DialogEnable						Every time she gazes at the blue planet, she has an inexplicable feeling in her heart.																						
4	4		301									The blue planet known as Earth is said to be the cradle of mankind.																						
5	5		301									But in reality, she never regarded the planet as her home.																						
6	6		301									After all, she has been living among the clouds and stars since her birth.																						
7	7		301									Her parents, who were once residents of Earth, never shied away from sharing stories with her about the former glories of mankind.																						
8	8		301									They said that it was an era of human ignorance.																						
9	9		301									It was an era of human courage.																						
10	10		301									It was an era when mankind was full of longing for all the beauty of the universe.																						
11	11		301									She could not understand the true meaning of these words, but she could feel the sincerity hidden deep within their hearts.																						
12	12		301									Pride, sentiment... And lingering pain.																						
13	13		301									Like a somber needle stabbing at her heart.																						
14	14		301									So she inevitably began to yearn for the blue planet.																						
15	15		301									All who lay eyes on the blue planet cannot help becoming enchanted by its beauty.																						
16	16		301									Even while quietly viewing from afar through the observation filter in Babylonia, the softest nerve in your heart will be affected by it.																						
17	17		301									The storms described in stories do not exist in Babylonia, only on the blue planet.																						
18	18		301									Rainbows described in stories do not exist in Babylonia, only on the blue planet.																						
19	19		301									Why did humanity wish to free themselves from the shackles of gravity so urgently?																						
20	20		301									—She had such doubts.																						
21	21		301									Flowers are a rare sight in Babylonia. Precious resources are not allowed to be wasted on flora solely for the purpose of viewing. Such fantastical things can only exist in photo albums and stories.																						
22	22		301									If possible...																						
23	23		301									She wants to see a sunrise with her own eyes.																						
24	24		301									She wants to see stars spread across the night sky with her own eyes.																						
25	25		301									She wants to see rainfall form a river with her own eyes.																						
26	26		301									She wants to see snowflakes cover the ground in a blanket of white with her own eyes.																						
27	27		301									The changing of seasons, the waxing and waning of the moon, the thunder in spring and the rustling pines in winter...																						
28	28		301									Fields of various grains. Grassy hillsides where sheep frolic.																						
29	29		301									Verdant fields waving in the wind. Banks where golden flowers grow.																						
30	30		301									Flocks of goldfinches. Lush vineyards. Barren seashores.																						
31	31		301									If what is portrayed in stories really exists...																						
32	32		301									She really really wanted to see it with her own eyes.																						
33	33		301									...																						
34	34		301									...

37	37		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						How long has it been? She could not remember.																						
38	38		301									What seemed like only a brief moment also felt like an eternity.																						
39	39		301									—[Selena].																						
40	40		301									The pain that keeps pressing her heart stops suddenly upon hearing this name called out.																						
41	41		301									The moment she opens her eyes, she recalls what all had happened.																						
42	42		301									The original promise was now a nightmare.																						
43	43		301									What she wants to protect has become the source of sin.																						
44	44		301									At first, she only wanted to inherit the legacy of her companions.																						
45	45		301									But why has she ended up here?																						
46	46		301									She knows within her heart what to do now.																						
47	47		301									Embracing the black needle left by the familiar yet strange human, she thrusts it into her power source.																						
48	48		301									Let everything end here.																						
49	49		301									Looking up, she seems to catch a glimpse of sky light.																						
50	50		301									At that moment, all of her misery fades away.																						
51	51		301									Is this what looking up at the sky from the surface of Earth feels like?																						
52	52		301									It's so beautiful that people forget fear, pain and hatred.																						
53	53		301									Bathed in the brilliance, she feels like everything is gradually evaporating away.																						
54	54		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Before everything disappears, a poem left by the Golden Age suddenly appears in her the chaotic and collapsing M.I.N.D.—																						
55	999		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png																								
56	55		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						To see a world in a grain of sand,																						
57	56		301									And a heaven in a wild flower,																						
58	57		301									Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,																						
59	58		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					And eternity in an hour.																						
60	59		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory336.png																								
61	60		301			AniZhuanchangEnd		1000				Her remains lay quietly on the dry, scorched earth.																						
62	61		301									The remnants of the scattered Red Tide squirm toward her like maggots.																						
63	62		301									Part of the Red Tide once again attaches to her remains, absorbing her strength in preparation to condense her remains into the monster from before.																						
64	63		301									One foot steps onto the Red Tide.																						
65	64		301									The deadly Red Tide ripples like a puddle beneath her foot.																						
66	65		301									She stops, lowers her eyes, and looks down at the broken remains, as if observing a small flower poking out from within a crack in the rock.																						
67	66		301								???	If...																						
68	67		301									The light words are scattered by the wind.																						
69	68		301									As if she had received some response, she leans down and extends her hand toward the blue light on the chest of the remains.																						
70	73		301								Selena	...																						
71	74		301									The disfigured body trembles violently.																						
72	75		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The Hetero-Creature bound to Selena seems to receive instructions. Standing in a savage posture of growing ferocity, it suddenly turns into a surging red liquid, plentiful and flowing, gradually fading from Selena's body.																						
73	76		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cg1801_5.jpg																								
74	77		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Selena	...																						
75	78		301									She raises her finger as if to bush aside the messy hair around the ears of the reborn girl. However, she does not touch her even up until she finally retracts her hand.																						
76	79		301									The Hetero-Core fragment turns to powder in her hands.																						
77	83		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					She leaves without looking back.
