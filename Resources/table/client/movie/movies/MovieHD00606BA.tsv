4	4		301									The dull impacts of weapons can be heard all around, followed by the sound of explosions and electric surges.																						
5	5		301									Even though the alarm echoes throughout the underground city, the mechanoids show no signs of stopping.																						
6	6		301									Without their leaders at the command, the mechanoid battle devolves into chaos. Not that orders are necessary...																						
7	7		301									When they just need to kill those that are "different."																						
8	8		301									They just need to "keep fighting."																						
9	9		301									For these mechanoids, it is obvious that this has been written in their underlying code.																						
10	10		301								Mechanoids	We! Need! War!																						
11	11		301								Mechanoids	To the death! To the death!

29	28		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Celica	After their "declaration" to the world, the whole world was left in shock.	1																					
30	29		301								Hassen	Yes, after all, it was the first time that a human group declared a "break" from humanity.	2																					
31	30		301								Celica	After that, even the newly integrated World Government Intelligence Agency was mobilized for this purpose.	1																					
32	31		301								Hassen	You know how it ended. They had planned for it.	2																					
33	32		301								Hassen	...It's amazing that they managed to put everyone in hiding before making that kind of "declaration."	2																					
34	33		301								Celica	It's not inconceivable. Everyone knew that the School of Sapiens was preparing for something, just not that they were planning to "break" from humanity.	1																					
35	34		301								Hassen	—At that time, humanity was booming and the Golden Age was about to usher in a paradigm shift with interstellar colonization.	2																					
36	35		301								Hassen	If you had announced at that time that you were going to break from humanity, I would've thought you were crazy.	2																					
37	36		301								Celica	...Yet they still did it.	1																					
38	37		301								Hassen	Correct. And only now did we rediscover their existence.	2																					
39	38		301								Celica	...Who knows if the Gray Ravens have been able to carry out their mission without any issues.	1																					
40	39		301								Hassen	Asimov just informed me over the comms that they've gone significantly deeper underground, which has temporarily disabled remote communication.	2																					
41	40		301								Celica	...Are you worried about them?	1																					
42	41		301								Hassen	There's no point in being worried.	2																					
43	42		301								Hassen	I think we can believe 【kuroname】.	2																					
44	43		301								Celica	Because the commandant is a Chief from F.O.S.?	1																					
45	44		301								Hassen	No, because of 【kuroname】's belief in others.	2																					
46	45		301								Hassen	Even if 【kuroname】 sees the darkness buried within this world, the commandant still manages to find one's own direction in life.	2																					
47	46		301								Celica	...I really have no idea how you have so much insight into others.	1																					
48	47		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Hassen	That's why I am the President, and you are not.	2

55	54		302								What is it?	55																						
56	55		301								Lucia	There's no sign of fighting between the mechanoids in the buildings.	1																					
57	56		301								Lucia	But they keep moving toward somewhere deeper inside... as if they have found something.	1																					
58	57		302								Is something in here?	58																						
59	58		301								Lee	Judging from what we saw earlier, there may also be mechanoids similar to the "defects" here.	2																					
60	59		301								Lee	If they are in good condition, we may be able to ask for some information about this underground city.	1																					
61	60		302								Prepare to move out.	61
