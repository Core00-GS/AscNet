4	4		301									After clearing the game, the group rests their controllers and sits together to discuss their impressions.

6	6		301							1	Liv	So this is what a game is like, huh... It's a lot more different than what I thought they were.	1																					
7	7		201							1	1081001	1																						
8	8		301							1	Kamui	So this is what a beach vacation is like in the Golden Age... I feel like trying it out for real as well! We can play real volleyball on a real beach! And even surf!	1																					
9	9		201							1	500026																							
10	10		301							1	Lee	...Golden Age folks sure have a lot of ways to entertain themselves.	1																					
11	11		201							1	1031001	1																						
12	12		301							1	Liv	Yeah... Oh, I just looked up some info on the Golden Age database, and found more info on this game.	1																					
13	13		202							1					1																			
14	14		301									Liv displays her findings on the screen. It looks like a screenshot of the page when the game was about to be launched.																						
15	15		301								Game Intro	Memories O'nÔΩûVenus Beach is a VR casual game developed by Kuro Games.																						
16	16		301								Game Intro	"Immersive beach vacations with a huge variety of swimsuits is its main draw. Players can enjoy a fantastic vacation with their friends through online co-op..."																						
17	17		301								Game Intro	"Preorder will start soon! Share this post to participate in a lucky draw and stand to win a limited edition of the game, as well as the limited summer edition Shark-speare plushie..."																						
18	18		301									Some player comments can be seen below the re-posts.																						
19	19		301									Carry2513: Honestly, this is the game I'm looking forward to the most this year. Being able to see hotties in swimmies is pog but I can't be the only one who's drawn by the "r i c h" strategies, can I?																						
20	951563		301									sparklingPeng: Replying to @Carry2513: same																						
21	951564		301									Osibov: The GOTY Costume Design Award nomination brought me here. The cloth physics and rendering are so good I can't stop playing! FeelsBadMan that there's no touch, when is Kuro gonna get touch sensors in our VR? ;)																						
22	951565		301									ulelkeke: Made with a team of AAA fashion designers AND they have full creative freedom. You basically get a free swimsuit fashion show! I hope they deliver... but the price for the devices is a toll on my minimum wage																						
23	951566		301									shakeit: sooo much fun! spent an entire day trying on swimsuits with my friends!! The special must be Mr. P's design, I can tell at a glance! Oh and I got my bae to play and he can wear girl swimsuits lol buy it for this																						
24	951567		301									dero7: Replying to @shakeit: pog																						
25	951568		301									Wurd: Replying to @shakeit: nice																						
26	951569		301									jo: Replying to @shakeit: damn now where do i find a bf																						
27	951570		301									Claude: Replying to @shakeit: damn now where do i find a bf																						
28	951571		301									BoredBored: Replying to @shakeit: damn now where do i find a bf																						
29	951572		301									EsperaS: Replying to @shakeit: Yeah, but the preorders are basically all gone by day 1! How are you guys so fast?																						
30	22		301									Wadead: Oh nice the arcade games in the game hall map can actually be played!!! the level of details is nuts!! I heard Shome's private water park is opening soon too. Does this mean I can play the arcade games there too

32	25		201							1	1031001																							
33	26		301							1	Liv	...According to the available data, the game was only available for a limited pre-order once, and only a very small number of players got the game. Soon after that, the Punishing Virus happened...	1																					
34	27		201							1	1081001																							
35	28		301							1	Kamui	So this game was never officially released...	1																					
36	29		201							1	1031001	14																						
37	30		301							1	Liv	Seemed like a lot of people were really looking forward to it. What a pity...	1																					
38	31		201							1	1041001	1																						
39	32		301							1	Nanami	Nanami can make it more fun! THEN, it'll be popular again!	1																					
40	33		201							1	500026																							
41	34		301							1	Lee	Why would this type of useless data be so complete? Also, it's difficult enough to get VR cartridges in po-pan. How did you find it?	1																					
42	35		201							1	1081001																							
43	36		301							1	Kamui	Some other recon teams found it when they were tracking the Ascendants. They found this thing in a very hidden place.	1																					
44	37		301								Kamui	They thought it was something important, but learning that it really was just a game, I asked for it and they gave it to me.	1																					
45	38		201							1	500026																							
46	39		301							1	Lee	I'm more concerned about the lost information in the two melons... I have a feeling that it's not something we should ignore. Well... no way to verify it now.	1																					
47	40		301								Lee	This has just been... a strange ride from the start to finish.	1																					
48	41		302								But you looked like you had fun, Lee.	42																						
49	42		301								Lee	Your visual modules must be glitched... is what I'd like to say, but you don't have them, unfortunately. Otherwise, I'd like to fix them up for you.	1																					
50	43		302								You weren't your usual self, Lee.	44																						
51	44		301								Lee	...You mean playing the game?	1																					
52	45		301								Lee	Instead of allowing these two to turn Babylonia upside down out of boredom, an activity I can oversee is more within control. I'm just making a choice with the safety of the HQ in mind.	1																					
53	46		204							1	6																							
54	47		301								Lee	And well... I never said that I didn't like getting together with people like this.	1																					
55	48		201							1	500166																							
56	49		301							1	Lucia	Sorry, Kamui, I'm late. Ah, Commandant! Everyone's here...	1																					
57	50		301									Lucia, who seems to have finished her personal training, walks into the lounge and is surprised by the liveliness. Her gaze falls to the controller in Kamui's hand.																						
58	51		204							1	1																							
59	52		301							1	Lucia	You completed your mission?	1																					
60	53		301									You pause for a few seconds, before realizing that Lucia is referring to the in-game mission.																						
61	54		201							1	1081001	2																						
62	55		301							1	Kamui	All clear! But after clearing the level, we unlocked the Nightmare difficulty level. Lucia, you need to try this!	1																					
63	56		201							1	500166	5																						
64	57		301							1	Lucia	...Okay, then. I will break the highest score this time.	1																					
65	58		201							1	1111001																							
66	59		301							1	Karenina	Wait! Don't forget about me!	1																					
67	60		302								When did you get here, Karenina?	61																						
68	61		301								Karenina	I've been behind you from a while ago! How could you ignore me for so long!	1																					
69	62		302								You could have called out to me.	101																						
70	101		204							1	5																							
71	63		301								Karenina	...Well, I didn't want to disturb your game! I know I hate being disturbed when I'm focused on something!	1																					
72	64		301								Karenina	Oh right! 1v1 me! I definitely won't lose to you in a game!	1																					
73	102		204							1																								
74	65		301								Karenina	...	1																					
75	66		204							1	5																							
76	67		301								Karenina	Let me see how this thing is played first!	1																					
77	68		301								Karenina	...You can't like, install some explosives on this ball? Just passing it around is completely non-lethal!	1																					
78	69		302								This is beach volleyball, not murder volleyball.	100																						
79	100		204							1		4																						
80	70		301								Karenina	Whatever! I won't lose anyway!	1																					
81	71		202							1					1																			
82	72		301									Karenina drags Lucia into a duel of balls. Kamui and Nanami are acting as referees, and Liv and Lee are sitting on the sidelines watching.																						
83	73		301									...Finally. A short break in this never-ending war.																						
84	74		301									Everyone here must have similar wishes in their hearts.																						
85	75		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					‚Äî‚ÄîLet this holiday go on, for a little longer.
