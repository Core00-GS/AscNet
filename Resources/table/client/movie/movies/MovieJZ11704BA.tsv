5	5		301									In the silent disposal plant, something resembling a person suddenly coughs and pushes away the pile of remains and corpses stacking on top.																						
6	6		301								???	I'm... still alive?	1																					
7	7		301									The figure gropes their chest and unbuttons their shirt, causing a pile of scrap to fall onto the ground. Behind them are several bullets lodged before the figure's chest.																						
8	8		301								???	They saved me... Hehe, and that ol' geezer said it was a useless pile of junk. Guess not, since it saved my life! Mph... Ow...	1																					
9	9		202							1					1																			
10	10		301									Turning on the emergency light source reveals the surroundings and the person's identity—it is Letty.																						
11	11		301									Even though the bullets are designed specifically for killing Corrupted, they could not penetrate the pile of stolen items tucked within her jacket. Which, to her surprise, prevented potentially fatal injuries to her solid Construct exterior.																						
12	12		201							1	500256	5																						
13	13		301							1	Letty	What's this...?	1																					
14	14		301									Letty is surprised to pull out something soft from her bosom—a stuffed doll that looks like an ugly frog. She remembers taking it from a shopping district because it is so hideously cute. So she stuffed it in with everything else on a whim.																						
15	15		204							1																								
16	16		301								Letty	Oh, looks like I might have a use for this.	1																					
17	17		301									Letty presses the doll up against her wounds to stop vital fluid from pouring out.																						
18	18		204							1	5																							
19	19		301								Letty	Anyway, where am I...? Hey! Let me outta here!	1																					
20	20		301									Letty kicks the iron door on the outer wall with all her might, but there is only a heavy thud, the door thicker than she has imagined.																						
21	21		204							1																								
22	22		301								Letty	****... That ol' geezer should've killed me. I'm gonna smash his disgusting face in once I get out. Then I'll kill him while he begs for mercy! Only then will I have my revenge.	1																					
23	23		202							1					1																			
24	24		301									Letty smiles wickedly at the thought of Collins' peril. Suddenly, she hears an alarm coming from within her.																						
25	25		201							1	500256	3																						
26	26		301							1	Letty	Punishing Virus concentration surging... What's what?	1																					
27	27		301									As Letty turns her head in confusion, a few red lights illuminate the depths of the facility. She suddenly remembers seeing such a light in the past. This red light only brings blood, misery, and death...																						
28	28		401							1	202																							
29	29		204							1	19																							
30	30		301								Letty	Corrupted?!	1																					
31	31		301									Holding back the sharp pain in her chest, Letty gets up and stumbles to the corner of the garbage disposal plant.																						
32	32		301								Letty	Why! Why! Why! Why! Why are there Corrupted here?!	1																					
33	33		301									But the red light arrives faster than expected, and there is no place to hide. Letty accidentally falls to the ground while running, and she is quickly surrounded by Corrupted.																						
34	34		301								Letty	AAAAGGHHH!!! Why... why am I gonna die here?!	1																					
35	35		401						700	2	1510																							
36	36		401							2	1510																							
37	37		301									Letty pulls out her pistol and empties her mag at the approaching Corrupted, but only a few bullets hit their marks. She regrets not spending more time in training—she should not have slept through target practice.																						
38	38		204							1	5																							
39	39		301								Letty	**** you! Dammit!	1																					
40	40		202							1					1																			
41	41		301									Letty tries to quickly reload, but her trembling hands can barely hold onto the magazine. The items stuffed in her chest fall to the ground and, most importantly, so too does the life-saving magazine as it slides away.																						
42	42		301									Before Letty can run to pick up the magazine, several Corrupted surround her.

49	49		301							1	Letty	Dammit... I'm done for...	1																					
50	50		301									Letty thinks she is going to die at the hands of the Corrupted, but strangely, they only roar without taking another step toward her.																						
51	51		201							1	500272																							
52	52		301							1	???	Sis...!	1																					
53	53		301									A pair of hands lifts Letty to her feet. The hands belong to a Construct she has never seen before, but she is about the same age and wears the same clothes as the recruits.																						
54	54		301									Thinking she has been thrown a lifeline, she approaches her.																						
55	55		201							1	500256																							
56	56		301							1	Letty	Th-thank you! We're allies , you and I...	1																					
57	57		202							1					1																			
58	58		301									But quickly she realizes that she is not an ally at all, nor is she even a Construct. She is—a Corrupted!																						
59	59		301									Right as she tries to escape, the Corrupted grabs her hand tightly, scaring Letty half to death.																						
60	60		201							1	500272																							
61	61		301							1	???	Sis... You're here to save me. It's me, Luna. I... I've been waiting here for you all along.	1																					
62	62		301									The Corrupted named Luna does not attack her. Instead, she cries like a human child, and Letty is not sure what to do.																						
63	63		201							1	500254	16				1																		
64	64		301							1	Luna	It's so dark and scary here, but I always knew you'd come. I've been waiting here because I knew you'd come save me no matter what.	1

67	67		301							1	Letty	Sis...? But I...	2																					
68	68		301									Letty may not be smart, but she is crafty. Right as she is about to deny it, she realizes that the only reason she is not attacking her is that she has mistaken her for her sister.																						
69	69		204							2																								
70	70		301								Letty	L-Luna...? That's right, Luna. Your sister is here to save you!	2																					
71	71		204							1	1																							
72	72		301									Luna's crying subsides into a smile. She gently nods and hugs Letty.																						
73	73		204							2	5																							
74	74		301								Letty	Ah! Ouch, ouch, ouch! Let me go!!!	2																					
75	75		202							1	2				1																			
76	76		301									Despite being pushed away, Luna isn't angry. Instead, she picks up something off the ground. Letty looks at it carefully to see that it is the plush doll she has just used to put pressure on her wound. It must have fell out along with the magazine.																						
77	77		201							1	500254	1																						
78	78		301							1	Luna	...It's Froggie!	1																					
79	79		301								Luna	You still have it! I knew you'd bring it with you when you looked for me.	1																					
80	80		204							1	16																							
81	81		301								Luna	Sorry, Sis... I should've told you I was leaving. You must've been worried sick.	1																					
82	82		301									Letty watches her cherish the dirty and ugly doll covered with vital fluid in her arms. It disgusts her, but at the same time, she is happy that she has come up with a wonderful idea.																						
83	83		203							1	0.25	-400																						
84	84		201							2	500256		400																					
85	85		301							1	Letty	It's... It's okay! The two of us need to go home together.	2																					
86	86		204							1	1																							
87	87		301								Luna	Yeah, but how do we get out of here...	1																					
88	88		301									Letty grins with ill intent, patting Luna on the shoulder.																						
89	89		301								Letty	No worries, I have an idea. But first, we need to take care of the enemies here...	2																					
90	90		204							1																								
91	91		301								Luna	Enemies?	1																					
92	92		301								Letty	Yeah... See those Corrupted over there? If we don't destroy them, they'll kill me with wounds as bad as these.	2																					
93	93		301								Luna	But they didn't attack me...	1																					
94	94		301								Letty	They're playing tricks on you...	2																					
95	95		301								Luna	Tricks...?	1																					
96	96		301								Letty	Yeah, they're trying to catch you off guard. They ARE monsters, after all... They're trying to trick you, so they can kill me.	2																					
97	97		301								Letty	Do you... not trust your sister?	2																					
98	98		204							1	4																							
99	99		301								Luna	I didn't mean that! I trust you! I believe anything you say, Sis...	1																					
100	100		301								Letty	If that's the case, then we have to kill them... Every single one...	2																					
101	101		301								Luna	Yeah... Yeah!	1																					
102	102		202							1	2				1																			
103	103		301									Seeing Luna ready to fight with all her might, Letty struggles to stifle her laughter with all of hers.
