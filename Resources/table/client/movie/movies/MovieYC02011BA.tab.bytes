4	4		201							1	500334																							
5	5		301							1	Roland	Goddamn Lamia...	1																					
6	6		301									Roland expected her to run, but she did it at a very awkward time.																						
7	7		301									Fortunately, he was able to use Cerberus to contain Voodoo, taking only an acceptable amount of damage. He got what he wanted.																						
8	8		204							1	2																							
9	9		301							1	Roland	Hope our Cerberus friends aren't too shocked when they find out the truth.	1																					
10	10		301									He smiles.																						
11	11		301								Roland	Well, it will be too late for them anyway.	1																					
12	12		301									He has returned to the wasteland. But this time, he has a purpose.																						
13	13		301									Once again, the girl in black shows up in front of him‚Äî																						
14	14		201							1	500308																							
15	15		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Cinderelik	You there, come with me.	1																					
16	16		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory378.png																								
17	17		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Cinderelik	Come with me, please.

19	19		201							2	500334		-400																					
20	20		301							1	Roland	Who are you?	2																					
21	21		301									The girl did not reply. She only looks at him calmly.																						
22	22		301									Roland sees no emotion or demand in her eyes. They look like a deep lake engulfed in fog.																						
23	23		301									‚ÄîHe does not like those eyes.																						
24	24		301								Roland	Why?	2																					
25	25		301								Cinderelik	...	1																					
26	26		301									She does not answer.																						
27	27		301									Roland strolls forward as he is about to leave the girl behind.																						
28	28		301								Cinderelik	This is what you wanted.	1																					
29	29		301									‚ÄîRoland pauses his steps.																						
30	30		301								Roland	...How do you know? Wait, no...	2																					
31	31		301								Roland	Not just in the house, you have been tracking me since long ago, right?	2																					
32	32		301									Cinderelik didn't deny.																						
33	33		301								Roland	State your offer. After all this drama, I don't think we need to test each other any further.	2																					
34	34		301								Cinderelik	That's not my mission.	1																					
35	35		202							1					1																			
36	36		203							2	0.25																							
37	37		301									The girl turns away in silence and heads out.																						
38	38		301								Roland	...Tsk, whatever.	2																					
39	39		301									But Roland isn't going to simply follow her.																						
40	40		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					He has his own plans.																						
41	41		202							1	2				1																			
42	42		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory12.jpg																								
43	43		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Roland follows Cinderelik over a long way in silence, until the nearby scenery has completely changed.																						
44	44		301									He walks over many deserted towns, buildings and bastions destroyed by Corrupted and human weapons.																						
45	45		301									But no matter how he tries to talk to Cinderelik, she never answers.																						
46	46		301									Roland even brought Corrupted from afar to attack her, or set up traps along the way‚Äî																						
47	47		201							1	500308																							
48	48		301							1	Cinderelik	Don't do unnecessary things.	1																					
49	49		202							1					1																			
50	50		301									The girl says calmly.																						
51	51		201							1	500334																							
52	52		301							1		Her words contain no "request" or "restriction," but Roland feels they are more dangerous than straight-forward threatening like "the consequences are dire."																						
53	53		301									Her real strength is still a mystery, but from what she has displayed, she still has lots of cards to play.																						
54	54		301									In that case, he can only continue to follow.																						
55	55		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					With this in mind, Roland keeps walking after her.																						
56	56		202							1					1																			
57	57		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory18.jpg																								
58	58		201							1	500308																							
59	59		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Cinderelik	Please.	1																					
60	60		301									Roland has lost track of time. He is already used to the strange pattern of changing scenes along the way.																						
61	61		301									Cinderelik stops at a high-rise building ruin. She orders a few Corrupted to push away a heavy piece of building wreckage.																						
62	62		201							1	500334																							
63	63		301							1		‚ÄîThis has to be it, Roland thinks.																						
64	64		301									After countless detours along the way to make Roland unable to find out the exact location.																						
65	65		301									Now that he is finally here, it is all over.																						
66	66		301									Maybe snipers have taken aim on him for a hundred times.																						
67	67		301									But this is the end.																						
68	68		301									At least they want him to come here, Roland thinks.																						
69	69		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					‚ÄîSo he follows Cinderelik into the large ruins.																						
70	70		202							1					1																			
71	71		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory18.jpg																								
72	72		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The road inside is wide, but almost all light is absorbed by the ruins.																						
73	73		301									He can only see Cinderelik walking past dappled light spots.																						
74	74		201							1	500334																							
75	75		301							1	Roland	(No, she's not the only one.)	1																					
76	76		301									Someone is watching him. Actually, there's more than one. No less than two digits.																						
77	77		301								Roland	(It's getting busy here...)	1																					
78	78		301									But they are only watching.																						
79	79		301									Roland would have prepared himself if they were "aiming" or "preparing to attack."																						
80	80		301									But he doesn't know how to respond to this neutral "observation."																						
81	81		301									He senses a familiar sight‚Äîit must be that "Voodoo" female.																						
82	82		301									She would have attacked him without hesitation. But Roland doesn't feel it.																						
83	83		301									Is she under someone's control? Did anyone order her to "not attack"?																						
84	84		204							1	2																							
85	85		301								Roland	Whoever is behind all this, he makes a pretty good dog trainer.	1																					
86	86		204							1																								
87	87		301									Roland purposely makes a taunting statement.																						
88	88		301									Is this simple taunt going to work? Roland wonders.																						
89	89		301									There is no response. The watchers are still eying on him, while Cinderelik continues to walk without a word.																						
90	90		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	(...Tsk.)	1																					
91	91		202							1					1																			
92	92		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory19.jpg																								
93	93		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Roland sees a lit-up area in front.																						
94	94		301									The inside of the ruin is mostly dark. Only that area is lit up by the sunlight from above.																						
95	95		301									‚ÄîAlmost like a spotlight on stage.																						
96	96		301									A black figure is standing in the spot.																						
97	97		201							1	500308																							
98	98		301							1	Cinderelik	Mr. Vonnegut, the guest has arrived.	1																					
99	99		201							1	500313																							
100	100		301							1	???	Good.	1																					
101	101		202							1					1																			
102	102		301									He turns back, facing Cinderelik and Roland.																						
103	103		201							1	500305																							
104	104		301							1	???	Glad to meet you, Roland, a "knight" who lost his master.	1																					
105	105		301								Vonnegut	I am Vonnegut.	1																					
106	106		301								Vonnegut	Now that you have made your way here, I can give you my straight forward promise.	1																					
107	107		301								Vonnegut	Come work for me. I can make your wish come true.	1																					
108	108		201							1	500334																							
109	109		301							1	Roland	If that's the case, I trust you can understand that I have no interest in these social concepts.	1																					
110	110		301								Roland	Why don't we cut to the chase?	1																					
111	111		301									Roland makes a bold statement. He isn't keen to get himself overly involved.																						
112	112		301									After all, he only came because he wanted to find out if they had the thing he longed for.																						
113	113		201							1	500305																							
114	114		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Vonnegut	I can give you what you want.	1
