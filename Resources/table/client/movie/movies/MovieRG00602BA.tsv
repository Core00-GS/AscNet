5	5		301									You do not remember anything before that, and you do not know how you got here.																						
6	6		301									A few Scavengers found you by the coast and saved you, and you have lived here ever since.																						
7	7		301									The old mechanic in the town needs an apprentice, and you are the obvious choice.																						
8	8		301									It is not a particularly difficult craft. It does not take you long before you start fixing up some simple things by yourself.																						
9	9		301									Days begin to pass quickly once you no longer have to worry about making a living.																						
10	10		301									And you spend less and less time wondering about your past.																						
11	11		301									Why did the sea take you here?																						
12	12		301									The answer to that question becomes less important once you are used to the sea breeze and the pace of the small town.

28	28		302			AniZhuanchangEnd					Today's order is...	29																						
29	29		301			DialogEnable						You roll up the shutter to the workshop and take the notebook hanging by the sign. When the townsfolks require a mechanic, they write down their requests for your mentor and you to sort out the next day.

37	37		301									Your first destination is a courtyard in the countryside.																						
38	38		301									The place is said to be abandoned for a long time. A rich family recently bought the land, and they made a huge deal about fixing up the estate.

41	41		301									You spot the pointy tower of the estate at the other end of the forest after about ten minutes of walk. Before it is a large courtyard.																						
42	42		301									Standing in front of the fence, you are about to call for someone to open the gate before you notice someone from the corner of your eye.																						
43	43		301									There is a small and old cemetery by the courtyard—the rich family has had a long argument with the mayor about tearing down the "unsightly" place.

45	45		301							1		A hooded girl is kneeling before a gravestone, her head lowered and her palms clasped as if she is praying.																						
46	46		301									The family will certainly kick her out if they discover what she is doing.																						
47	47		302								What are you doing here?	48																						
48	48		301									Before you realize it, you have already approached the girl and asked her your question.																						
49	49		301									Most of the people buried here were dead for centuries. You cannot imagine a girl this young would be here for any of them.																						
50	50		204							1																								
51	51		301								???	Ah...	1																					
52	52		301								???	Nothing.	1																					
53	53		301									Hearing you, the girl slowly stands up and turns around to face you, smiling.																						
54	54		302								If the people living here see you...	55																						
55	55		204							1	8																							
56	56		301								???	That's okay. My task here is complete.	1																					
57	57		301									She interrupts you as if she knows what is about to come.

59	59		301								???	I was simply saying goodbye.	1																					
60	60		302								...?																							
61	61		301								???	By the way, are you happy? With your time here?																						
62	62		302								Fifty-fifty.	63	I'm quite happy.	64

64	64		204							1	2																							
65	65		301								???	I'm glad to hear that.	1																					
66	66		301									You are not sure why she asked. That said, you getting saved by the townsfolks caused quite a stir back then. She must have recognized you from that.																						
67	67		301									That also explains why you do not remember her.																						
68	68		204							1																								
69	69		301								???	It's my time to go, then.	1																					
70	70		301								???	Until we meet again.	1																					
71	71		302								...Again?	72																						
72	72		301									You want to bid her farewell, but a strange feeling suddenly overwhelms you.																						
73	73		302								Have I seen her before?	74																						
74	74		202							1																								
75	75		301									You watch silently as the girl walks farther and farther away until she disappears from your sight.																						
76	76		302								Never mind.	77
