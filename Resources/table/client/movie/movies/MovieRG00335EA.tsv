5	5		301									Everyone was doing their best against the King and his guards, but no one could land the last hit.																						
6	6		201							1	500180	5																						
7	7		301							1	Karenina	What's going on? He already has an HP bar, but we still can't beat him!	1																					
8	8		301								Karenina	Camu, Vera!	1																					
9	9		201							1	500181																							
10	10		301							1	Vera	Don't blame us. This is very normal.	1																					
11	11		302								Normal?	12	Is this also a system feature?	13																				
12	12		301								Vera	Why else would we let Liv create the real artifact?	1																					
13	13		201							1	1081001	5																						
14	14		301							1	Kamui	Right. Some NPCs cannot be defeated by players even if they have an HP bar. The system will "lock" their health.	1																					
15	15		201							1	500016																							
16	16		301							1	King	The artifact may not be complete, but I already have power! Once I take your artifact away, I will become perfect!	1																					
17	17		301								King	Now die!	1																					
18	18		201							1	500166	5																						
19	19		301							1	Lucia	Defend yourselves!	1																					
20	20		301									Everybody followed Lucia's order to scatter while continuing to give the King pressure.																						
21	21		201							1	500113																							
22	22		301							1	Demon King	Hey, what about me!? Liv and I finally got the real artifact, but what shall I do next!?	1																					
23	23		201							1	500176																							
24	24		301							1	Camu	Do you really have to ask us? You were the one who used it!	1																					
25	25		201							1	500113																							
26	26		301							1	Demon King	Oh!	1																					
27	27		301									The Demon King suddenly remembered something and lifted his head... Well, his entire body was a "head."																						
28	28		301									He immediately turned to Liv, who was holding the artifact cluelessly.																						
29	29		301								Demon King	Liv, point the artifact at me, then shout out the name of the mightiest person!	1																					
30	30		201							1	500174																							
31	31		301							1	Liv	What? The mightiest person?	1																					
32	32		201							1	500113																							
33	33		301							1	Demon King	Yes. Then I'll be able to transform into that person and gain the power to control the system.	1																					
34	34		302								Can't you be more specific?	35	Can't you just turn into your old form?	36																				
35	35	37	301								Demon King	I already forgot what I looked like when I turned into this. I can only count on you, heroes!	1																					
36	36		301								Demon King	I already forgot what I looked like when I became like this. I can only count on you, heroes!	1																					
37	37		201							1	500174																							
38	38		301							1	Liv	The name of the mightiest person... Hmm.	1																					
39	39		301									It seemed to be the most difficult question to Liv. Others might have an answer immediately, but she always saw everybody as equal.																						
40	40		201							1	500016																							
41	41		301							1	King	Roarrrr!	1																					
42	42		301									The King's attacks intensified. The heroes could still hold him, but if they could not land the last hit, it would only be a matter of time before they lost.																						
43	43		201							1	500113																							
44	44		301							1	Demon King	Liv!	1																					
45	45		201							1	500174	6																						
46	46		301							1	Liv	Um... The mightiest...	1																					
47	47		302								Just shout Overlord!	48	Have faith in yourself, Liv!	55																				
48	48		301								Liv	Overlord... Right, this is the "Land of Overlord." The Overlord must be the mightiest!	1																					
49	49		301									Liv took a deep breath in, then pointed the artifact toward the Demon King and shouted the name.																						
50	50		301								Liv	Overlord Celica!	1																					
51	51		301									Wait, why Celica!?																						
52	52		301									A concerned look appeared on Liv as I asked.																						
53	53		301								Liv	I've been reading Miss Celica's novel recently... So I accidentally...	1																					
54	54	63	301									I had no idea what the novel was about, but the artifact seemed to be working.																						
55	55		301									Liv was worried that the name she shouted wasn't the best. I told her to trust her choice.																						
56	56		301								Liv	There's no time to waste!	1																					
57	57		301									Liv took a deep breath in, then pointed the artifact toward the Demon King and shouted the name.																						
58	58		301								Liv	Celica!!!	1																					
59	59		301									Wait, why Celica!?																						
60	60		301									Knowing that I was baffled by her choice, Liv turned to me and explained.																						
61	61		301								Liv	Miss Celica once said she was the best of best.	1																					
62	62		301									The best of best didn't make sense to me, but the artifact seemed to be working.
