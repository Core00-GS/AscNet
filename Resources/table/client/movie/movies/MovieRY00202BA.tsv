5	5		301									Nanami barges into the Gray Raven lounge with grandeur before realizing that only Liv is there.																						
6	6		301								Nanami	Hmm? Liv, are you the only one here? Where are the others?	1

9	9		301							1	Liv	Nanami? Is something wrong? I'm sorry, but everyone is quite busy currently...	2																					
10	10		301									Seeing how hectic Liv is organizing the files, it really does seem like a busy time to Nanami.																						
11	11		204							1																								
12	12		301								Nanami	Do you need any help, Liv? Nanami is super duper strong!	1																					
13	13		204							2	1																							
14	14		301								Liv	I appreciate the thought, but I can... I can handle it...	2																					
15	15		301									Liv smiles and carries a huge pile of parts and documents, her legs trembling from the weight.																						
16	16		204							2																								
17	17		301								Liv	Everyone on the team has different businesses to take care of today. Commandant's two hours from the end of a meeting, however. You can sit here and wait if you don't mind, but I have to go now.	2

20	20		301									Liv leaves while carefully holding on to all the random things she is carrying, leaving Nanami by herself in the lounge.																						
21	21		301								Nanami	Who knows how long I have to wait until they're back? Nanami's so bored...	1																					
22	22		301									Dispirited, Nanami checks out Gray Raven's schedule in the lounge, which lists out all of the Gray Ravens' work arrangements today, updating in real-time.																						
23	23		204							1	1																							
24	24		301								Nanami	So the Gray Ravens are all out helping the different departments... No wonder Liv was carrying all those stuff in such a hurry...	1																					
25	25		301								Nanami	How about Commandant? Hmm, a strategy meeting with Chrome from Strike Hawk... for two hours?! That'll take forever...	1																					
26	26		301									Losing interest, Nanami stares at the screen, suddenly finding a report that has her curious.																						
27	27		204							1																								
28	28		301								Nanami	Oh? Didn't Lee mention a bug in Gestalt in a recent report? Though the Engineering Force is just treating it as a random data disorder after their inspections...	1																					
29	29		301									For some reason, Nanami has a hunch that this is no ordinary bug, and so she checks out the details in the report.																						
30	30		301								Nanami	Inside the code of this bug report... is a secretly hidden backdoor program! What is going on? Let Nanami give it a crack...	1																					
31	31		301									She connects with Gestalt to find that despite the strings on the bug being fixed, the secret backdoor from within the system has remained.																						
32	32		301								Nanami	It's crude, but it's good enough to hide from a routine inspection...	1																					
33	33		301								Nanami	If Nanami fixes this bug, mecha babushka has to be satisfied with her, right?	1																					
34	34		204							1	1																							
35	35		301								Nanami	Then it's decided! And it's definitely not because Nanami's bored and wants to sneak in and play!	1																					
36	36		301									Having convinced herself, Nanami finds a comfortable spot to lie down and swings her hands around with odd gestures.																						
37	37		204							1	1																							
38	38		301							1	Nanami	Go—go—Nanami!	1

40	40		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					As her cognitive senses dissociate from reality, Nanami's vision is slowly wrapped in fuzzy white noise—																						
41	41		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory260.png																								
42	42		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						By the time the white noise fades away, Nanami finds herself in Babylonia. But despite looking the same, the occasional data flows in the air indicates that the place she is in right now is the virtual space.																						
43	43		201							1	500091																							
44	44		301							1	Nanami	Hmm, so I did manage to get in. That fake clearance level is splendidly made for sure! Seems like it's not a naturally formed backdoor... someone left it behind on purpose.	1																					
45	45		301									She puts on a straight face and plays investigator, snooping around for a while, but she fails to discover anything special beyond some standard repair programs.																						
46	46		301								Nanami	Maybe it comes from somewhere deeper than here...	1																					
47	47		301								Nanami	Hello there, Mr. Program! Let Nanami take a look at your repair log, won't you?	1																					
48	48		301									The program obviously cannot answer her. It just accepts her request and pulls out the logs that are accessible to Nanami's clearance level.																						
49	49		301								Nanami	MZ105423 repaired... MZ105424A repaired... MZ105424B repaired... Repaired, repaired, repaired... It appears that everything is on the up and up.	1																					
50	50		301								Nanami	Hmm...? One of the areas was skipped from inspection! Could it be where it's hiding?	1																					
51	51		204							1	1																							
52	52		301								Nanami	Nanami is getting closer and closer to the truth! Let's go!	1																					
53	53		202							1					1																			
54	54		301									She tosses the repair program back to its companions, and before they can issue a disruption warning, Nanami is already long gone.																						
55	55		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					After the disruption is gone, the repair programs return to their routine as if nothing has happened—they are preprogrammed codes only, after all.																						
56	56		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory260.png																								
57	57		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						With the screech of wheels braking, the speeding Nanami comes to a sudden stop at the target location.																						
58	58		201							1	500091	1																						
59	59		301							1	Nanami	Agent Nanami, reporting! Destination arrived! But... which direction should I go next?	1																					
60	60		204							1																								
61	61		301									Nanami stands on tiptoes to look around, but she cannot find anything out of place.																						
62	62		301								Nanami	It surely isn't easy. Nanami must have missed some clues along the way... Hey! What is that?	1																					
63	63		301									A bunny-shaped program stands out from the rest of the repair programs. It walks past Nanami, muttering, and after the two look at each other in the eyes for a second, the bunny suddenly dashes away.																						
64	64		301								"Bunny"	Oh dear<//TICK-TOCK>! Oh dear<//TICK-TOCK>! I shall be too late<//TICK-TOCK>!																						
65	65		301									Stupefied, Nanami freezes for a moment before finally reacting to the bunny, which might be related to the bug that has left the backdoor behind in Gestalt.																						
66	66		301								Nanami	Hey, bugged bunny! Stop running! Stay where you are!	1																					
67	67		301									Noticing that Nanami is chasing it from behind, the bugged bunny runs even faster before disappearing at a concealed corner.																						
68	68		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Nanami does not even pause to think when she goes after it, and by the time she notices the strange barrier before her, she has already stepped through and entered a hidden dimension...
