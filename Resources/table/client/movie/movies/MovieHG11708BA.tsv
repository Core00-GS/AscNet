27	28		301								Lee	I've virtually double-reconstructed the data through the Spear of F.O.S., but I didn't experience it myself after all. There might still be discrepancies between the reconstructed data and what you went through.	1																					
28	29		301								Lee	You can begin to work on this after you are fully recovered. I'll tell Asimov about it.	1

56	56		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lee	Human or Construct, when they face death, their deepest emotions hidden inside their memories become bare. This also matches with the consciousness data that we've seen in the Red Tide.	1

65	65		301								Asimov	First things first, though, you'll have to fully cooperate, Gray Raven Commandant.	1																					
66	66		302								Sure.	67	I've been fully cooperative all the time.	67

73	73		302								Yeah, get him, Lee.	74	Lee, it's okay.	74																				
74	74		301								Asimov	You're right. Do whatever you want on the field, I couldn't care less. I just want data, so you know what to do.	1

93	91		302								...Luna?	92																						
94	92		301								Asimov	The "consciousnesses" consumed and rebuilt by the Red Tide are not the "consciousness beings" themselves—these are only bait used by the Red Tide.																						
95	93		301								Asimov	Which is why they take on the appearance and form that can most affect the related subjects.

136	132		302								...!	133																						
137	133		301									But not the Luna shades you have been seeing. This is the grown-up Luna, the Ascendant. Somehow, the word "safe" springs into your mind when you see her hair sprawled on her cheeks and on the bed.																						
138	134		301								Asimov	Your heart rate is rising. What's the matter?																						
139	135		302								...	136																						
140	136		302								Do you remember when you told me about...	137																						
141	137		302								The self-defense mechanism of a M.I.N.D.?	138																						
142	138		301								Asimov	...You mean the drowner effect? What's wrong?																						
143	139		302								Drowner effect?	140																						
144	140		301								Asimov	Something from an earlier age when Construct tech wasn't that mature. If a commandant's Mind Beacon with a Construct isn't stable enough, or if they aren't compatible, the M.I.N.D. will try to get rid of the intruder.																						
145	141		302								What happens then?	142	Is this why "remote link" was discontinued?	143																				
146	142	144	301								Asimov	Let's imagine the M.I.N.D. as an ocean. A Construct is like someone that's drowning, so they'll instinctively grab at anything they can.																						
147	143		301								Asimov	That's part of the reason. But mostly, it's because remote link back then can cause irreparable psychological damage to a commandant.																						
148	144		301								Asimov	But that's nothing to worry about now. The compatibility of our modern Constructs blows the earlier models out of the water. You can be rest assured that the drowner effect won't happen.																						
149	994		301								Asimov	After all, if this happens even once, we'd lose precious commandant personnel. We don't have that many to spare.																						
150	145		302								...	146	Yay for science.	146																				
151	146		301								Asimov	Why are you asking me this all of a sudden?																						
152	147		302								Just remembering something...	148																						
153	148		302								Do drowned Constructs remember anything?	149																						
154	149		301								Asimov	In their M.I.N.D.? Theoretically, they should. But it's been ages since I've done research on that topic, you got some ideas you wanna share?																						
155	150		302								Nah, not really.	151	I'll tell you if I think of any.	151																				
156	151		301									Asimov snorts over the channel and falls silent.																						
157	152		301									You carefully scan the room... Such a warm and quiet room this is.																						
158	153		301									This is the deepest, safest place in Luna's M.I.N.D.																						
159	154		301									She spent her childhood here with Lucia. This must be the memories she treasure the most.																						
160	155		301								Asimov	...So, any findings?																						
161	156		302								...Nothing, really.	157																						
162	157		301								Asimov	That's what Lucia said as well. She said that these memories should be Luna's... ah, what was it again—most precious moments?
