5	5		202							1					1																			
6	6		301								Chiko	Yeah. It was a long time ago.

8	8		301							1	Bianca	It's a bit strange, here.	1																					
9	9		301								Bianca	The Construct named Jett said the following in a vocal range only Specialized Constructs can hear.	1																					
10	10		202							1					1																			
11	11		301								Chiko	I can't hear it.																						
12	12		201							1	1091001																							
13	13		301							1	Bianca	Let me translate it for you.	1

15	15		301									Bianca says it as she taps the data panel of the KI.GAL Archives. The projection of the Babylonia airdrop platform soon appears in the dim space.																						
16	16		301									Bianca quickly fast forwards the video, eventually stopping near the end of the recording.																						
17	17		301									In the recording, the glow of the power grid around Jett gradually fades. He holds himself up with his weapon, barely managing to stand instead of kneeling.																						
18	18		301								Jett	Doctor, perhaps you don't get it, but this is something that has made us truly feel alive.																						
19	19		301								Jett	We've chosen different ways to die, but at least we get to feel what freedom is like while we're alive.																						
20	20		301								Jett	But freedom comes at a price, of course.																						
21	21		301								Jett	Freedom has been a false proposition since we were made into Constructs.																						
22	22		301								Jett	We still chose to run from it even though we knew it was the truth.																						
23	23		301								Jett	Perhaps your courage in telling the truth has invoked our passion for adventure, something that we've almost forgotten.																						
24	24		301								Jett	Thank you...																						
25	25		301									The glow of the power grid fades completely. A member of the Purifying Force pulls the trigger at that moment, and half of Jett's face is blown away by the explosive shell.

27	27		301							1	Bianca	Why did he choose to convey the message in such an unusual way?	1																					
28	28		202							1					1																			
29	29		301								Chiko	Should we include the Doctor... Wanshi on the purifying list?																						
30	30		201							1	1091001																							
31	31		301							1	Bianca	...	1																					
32	32		301									Bianca thinks for a while, then removes Jett's speech from the file.																						
33	33		301								Bianca	That's not necessary. It has nothing to do with the doctor.	1																					
34	34		301								Bianca	Jett "never left" a special dialogue in the end.	1																					
35	35		202							1					1																			
36	36		301								Chiko	I see.
