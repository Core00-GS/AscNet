6	5		301							1	Asimov	...Do you copy? I'm assuming you've disembarked by now.		1																				
7	6		302								Just in time.	7	Just finished enhancing the Inver-Devices.	7																				
8	7		301								Asimov	There should still be visual interference from the virtual space, right? Don't worry about it for now.	1																					
9	8		301								Asimov	You disengaged from the virtual space too abruptly, preventing the Spear of F.O.S. from shutting down in time, leaving the real-time virtual spatial data generation in your cognitions.	1																					
10	9		301								Asimov	Generally speaking, it shouldn't be too much of a hindrance. You would've made a full recovery after a few days of rest in the infirmary. But time is of the essence, and I think we can use it to our advantage.	1																					
11	10		301								Asimov	I'm going to try to upload the Spear of F.O.S. to your command link to synchronize it with your senses. This should allow you to restore, record, and playback the spatial data that you find.	1																					
12	11		301								Asimov	...In other words, you can connect to Gestalt's massive computing power with a security device, allowing you to perceive and analyze scenarios, connect with entire systems, even restore and simulate past events.	1																					
13	12		302								We can restore anything we want?	13																						
14	13		301								Asimov	As long as there is fragmented data nearby, you can use Gestalt to restore it.	1

17	16		301							1	Lee	Including data that has nothing to do with leads?	2																					
18	17		301								Asimov	You can use key data from people and objects to display the information in the area. They can come in any shape‚Äîthey can even just be names. However, you must acquire the data first.	1																					
19	18		301								Asimov	By the way, since most people have been dispatched to the surface, Babylonia is now short-handed. A new liaison officer will take over for now. Also...	1																					
20	19		301								Asimov	Wait, I'll connect you to him.	1

26	25		301							1	Murray	That's not too bad. It'll filter out many useless information.	1																					
27	26		301								Lee	Murray?	2																					
28	27		301								Murray	Nothing strange about this, Lee. We can catch up once this crisis is averted.	1																					
29	28		301								Murray	Now, let Bridget give you the security terminal that Asimov mentioned.	1																					
30	29		301									Bridget smiles and hands over a package containing more than a dozen sophisticated cube-like devices.																						
31	30		301								Murray	I'm sure Asimov has explained what these are for.	1																					
32	31		302								(Take the bag)	32	This thing weighs a ton!	32																				
33	32		301								Murray	The weight hasn't been adjusted yet. Please bear with it for now.	1																					
34	33		301								Murray	But as long as the secure terminal is active, you'll be able to investigate the area more easily.	1																					
35	34		301								Murray	That's all we have to prepare for now. Any questions?	1																					
36	35		302								Nope.	36																						
37	36		301								Murray	I wish you all the best.	1																					
38	37		302								Alright, let's move out.

42	41		301							1	Bridget	Wait, „Äêkuroname„Äë. I better double-check your protective suit. Oh? Looks like everything is in working order.	1																					
43	42		301								Bridget	If you want to go into more dangerous areas later, you'll need to enhance it with a few mods. But don't put them on for too long! It'll take the breath right out of you, especially during vigorous activities.	1																					
44	43		301								Bridget	But I'm sure you're already familiar with the basics. Unlike those rookie commandants that forget basic safety rules in the heat of the moment.	1																					
45	44		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Bridget	Well, then. I wish you all the best!	1
