5	5		301			DialogEnable						A massive explosion flattens the entrance of the concrete pipe, completely burying the path.																						
6	6		301									With the target lost, the pursuer can only roll to the side to slow down.																						
7	7		301									Beside her, air flickers in scale-like shadows, slowly revealing a humanoid shape.																						
8	8		301								Yata	What do we do? Should we just blow up everything down there?																						
9	9		301								Valeria	...That's not in our mission. Let's retreat for now.																						
10	10		301								Yata	...Roger.																						
11	11		301								Yata	But his access logs are quite suspicious. Outside of the file IDs requested by Commander Nikola and President Hassen, there are also other search records.																						
12	12		301								Yata	I'm just trying to clear something up... Wanna hear me out, V?																						
13	13		301								Valeria	If it helps with our current situation.																						
14	14		301								Yata	I can't say for sure it'll be helpful.																						
15	15		301								Yata	Depending on what's behind this mess, we can go from promotions to court-martial, to being cleaned up by the Purifying Force.																						
16	16		301								Yata	Digging deeper into this means trouble, but ignoring it also causes troubles in the future.																						
17	17		301								Valeria	Then say it.																						
18	18		301								Yata	Kurono, Construct Tech... and the digital signatures of our two big guys.																						
19	19		301								Yata	You know how normal task force members and agents steer clear of Kurono stuff.																						
20	20		301								Yata	Getting kidnapped to some underground facility and executed for unauthorized access of classified info... That'd be getting off lightly.																						
21	21		301								Yata	If I learn that you got offed someday like that... Sorry, but I'd cut all ties with you, stat.																						
22	22		301								Valeria	Sure.																						
23	23		301								Yata	...Whatever. I knew you were a weirdo.																						
24	24		301								Yata	And thankfully, because you're such a weirdo, I won't feel bad if you end up dying in some gutter.																						
25	25		301								Yata	Otherwise, I'd never have joined Scarab.																						
26	26		301								Valeria	Back to the situation at hand.																						
27	27		301								Valeria	Do we go after our target, or not?																						
28	28		301								Yata	Can we even track our guy?																						
29	29		301								Valeria	...No.																						
30	30		301								Yata	Your brain only works when you're slaving away for our commander.																						
31	31		301								Valeria	That's why I have you here.																						
32	32		301								Yata	...I'll take it as a compliment that I'm reliable, I guess?																						
33	33		301								Valeria	Take it however you want, but you are indeed reliable.																						
34	34		301								Valeria	So, what do we do now?																						
35	35		301								Yata	...																						
36	36		301								Valeria	?																						
37	37		301								Yata	...I guess it's not my first day with you.																						
38	38		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Yata	I found another route. It'll cut through some areas that are... defended by Gestalt, but that should help us catch the invader.
