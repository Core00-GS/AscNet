3	3		301			DialogEnable						Lee and Liv are protecting the watermelon from the evil that is Nanami. Nanami is off to one side, staring at the watermelon and sulking.

5	5		301							1	Kamui	Lee, you might turn out to be a good competitive swimmer.	1																					
6	6		201							1	500173																							
7	7		301							1	Lee	Why so?	1																					
8	8		201							1	1081001	1																						
9	9		301							1	Kamui	Because you look good in a swimsuit.	1																					
10	10		301									Liv nods in agreement.																						
11	11		201							1	500174	1																						
12	12		301							1	Liv	I never imagined you in a swimsuit before, Lee, but after I actually saw you in one, it feels like you're made to wear it.	1																					
13	13		201							1	500173																							
14	14		301							1	Lee	...	1																					
15	15		201							1	500174																							
16	16		301							1	Liv	But you can't swim, right, Lee...?	1																					
17	17		201							1	500173																							
18	18		301							1	Lee	If there are water-based operations in the future, I will install the appropriate modules.	1																					
19	19		201							1	1081001	1																						
20	20		301							1	Kamui	So what should we play next? Is there anything you want to play, Commandant?	1																					
21	21		201							1	1041001																							
22	22		301							1	Nanami	Leave it to Nanami! Nanami knows everything about play!	1																					
23	23		301								Nanami	Nanami has been researching human behavior, and I know everything about beach sports!	1

25	25		201							2	500174		400																					
26	26		301							1	Nanami	First, Liv, you'll have to sit here, like this!	1																					
27	27		301								Nanami	Then Commandant, you have to lie on Liv's lap.	1																					
28	28		204							2	6																							
29	29		301							1	Liv	Huh?!	2																					
30	30		201							2	500173		400																					
31	31		301							1	Lee	Stop messing around.	2																					
32	32		301								Nanami	Aww, well... Then we can bury Commandant in sand, and make a sand castle on top.	1																					
33	33		301								Lee	I don't think this game supports that.	2																					
34	34		302								So does this mean you'll do it, if it's possible?	35																						
35	35		301								Lee	Don't put words in my mouth.	2																					
36	36		301								Nanami	Hmmmmmm, well then...	1																					
37	37		301								Lee	Where are you getting all these weird ideas from...	2																					
38	38		301								Nanami	In old human shows, the beach episode is almost always episode 7 or 8 in the series! Nanami has figured out the pattern!	1																					
39	39		301								Nanami	Nanami got through all of it in the database, which makes Nanami a beach master!	1																					
40	40		301								Lee	I don't know what you're talking about, but you should stop watching those weird shows.	2																					
41	41		302								Ah, Lee...	42																						
42	42		302								Your towel is falling off.	43																						
43	43		301									You reach over to grab the towel falling off Lee's body, but your hand slips right through his shoulder.																						
44	44		301								Lee	...?	2																					
45	45		301									...Right. This is a virtual space.																						
46	46		301									You withdraw your hand awkwardly.																						
47	47		201							1	500174	1	-400																					
48	48		301							1	Liv	It would be great if we could all come to a real beach to play like this.	1																					
49	49		301								Lee	The Corrupted are everywhere on Earth. We will have to find a suitable beach and cleanse the area first, then section off a safe zone.	2																					
50	50		301								Lee	I don't think our superiors would be so kind as to let us go down to earth simply for entertainment.	2																					
51	51		301								Liv	But I guess... inside a game like this, there's no need to worry about the Corrupted, at least.	1

53	53		201							1	1041001																							
54	54		301							1	Nanami	Oh... There are no Corrupted here, but...	1																					
55	55		401							2	1513																							
56	56		301									Booms resound in the distance. It closes in by the second.																						
57	57		301								Nanami	But...	1																					
58	59		301			RImgBg1Shake						Spurts of sand fly up on the beach. The sound grows louder.

60	75		204							1	2																							
61	60		301								Nanami	But if it's just normal baddies! There's a bunch of 'em!	1																					
62	61		401							2	1513																							
63	63		301			RImgBg1Shake						The source of the noise reveals itself to be a group of mechanoids, charging over at you.

66	66		301							1	Lee	These are simulated enemies used in training! Why would their data be in this game?!	2																					
67	67		301								Nanami	Ehehe! You can thank Nanami for that!	1																					
68	68		302								But why even Musashi models on the beach?	69																						
69	69		301								Nanami	Because Nanami thinks Musashi might also want a beach vacation.	1																					
70	70		301								Lee	Don't just mod in whatever you want!	2																					
71	111		204							1	1																							
72	71		301								Nanami	But Nanami wants to play Tsar Cry!	1																					
73	72		201							1	1081001	2	-400																					
74	73		301							1	Kamui	Hahaha! Isn't this fun? We can just treat it like an action game!	1
