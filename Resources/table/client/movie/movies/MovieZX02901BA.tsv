155	155		301								Construct C	Already did. He's on the low end, but that only shows he's not a Transcendant. I've read that Ascendants can control the Punishing Virus.	3																					
156	156		301								Construct C	We should speak to the elite squad about it. I heard they'll pass by this area.	3																					
157	157		301								Construct Captain	Yes, and "passing by" is all they're going to do. They won't come to the base because the Purifying Force is busy. And the Gray Raven Commandant just recovered, and...	2

179	179		301								Support Construct	Memory loss is one of the things that happens when M.I.N.D. deviates.	1																					
180	180		301								Support Construct	You're lucky, though. You're experiencing some issues with memory reading, but the data in there is otherwise intact.	1																					
181	181		301								Support Construct	What you're experiencing is rare, and people like you usually end up with aftereffects that are more severe if they don't get helped in time.	1																					
182	182		301								Support Construct	Maybe your M.I.N.D. is super stable.	1																					
183	183		201							1	500506

187	187		301								Support Construct	It's either that, or you can give yourself some time and see if you recall anything. It's quite a gamble, though.	1																					
188	188		201							1	500506																							
189	189		301							1	???	So I don't need to be treated to recover?	1																					
190	190		201							1	500407

288	288		302								I know he's met my team.	289

294	294		301								Young Man A	Well, when I saw the first-aid kit, it reminded me of a book on surgery that I read before and of when I lent a base doctor a hand.																						
295	295		302								It's a sign that the data in your M.I.N.D. is pretty much intact...	296																						
296	296		302								...If seeing things you're familiar with calls pieces of memories to your mind.	297																						
297	297		301				DialogDisable				Young Man A	Right. I was with a Support Construct just now. I didn't catch her name, but she said the same thing.																						
298	298		302								We can probably get you fixed up in Babylonia.	299																						
299	299		302								Except we're having some difficulty traveling back now.	300																						
300	300		302								A transport craft will come to pick us up in a few days, though.	301

303	303		301									As soon as he's finished the sentence, the young man realizes that your question was actually a trick question asked out of doubt—to see if his memory loss is feigned.																						
304	304		301									None of these people have any reason to trust him just because he was brought back here—which is exactly what the Constructs have said.																						
305	305		301									And even the young man himself finds their doubt fair, because he doesn't even trust himself.																						
306	306		301									They could make him a new addition to the good side—but what if he turns out to be a bad guy? The young man finds this idea terrifying.																						
307	307		301								Young Man A	I don't know... Let me think about that.																						
308	308		302								...	309	Alright.	309
