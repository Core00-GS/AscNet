4	4		301									This is one of the few places in Babylonia where you may gaze up and observe the universe. It is not staring at the earth, but at what is beyond it.																						
5	5		302								A view that ought to be shared.	6																						
6	6		301								Female Construct	I strongly advise against bringing anyone here. Without a permit, entering this restricted area puts both parties' lives in danger. The Purifying Force does not require permission to open fire in this spot.																						
7	7		302								Is that a threat?	8	...	8																				
8	8		301								Female Construct	Sorry, this is just a friendly reminder.																						
9	9		301								Female Construct	If you don't have a permit, even a Boss like you can be shot on the spot. That's how default settings work.																						
10	10		302								Is this why it requires so many levels of review?	11																						
11	11		301								Female Construct	Exactly. We appreciate your understanding.																						
12	12		301									The female Construct with long black hair taps away at the screen. The logo of the Purifying Force floats in midair, projecting various beams that surround the two individuals.

16	15		301									The screen gradually fades away. Then a machine's whizzing sound is heard, followed by a thud. A stream of frigid air gushes from the cutoff where the screen used to be.																						
17	16		301								Chiko	Please enter.																						
18	17		301									Chiko takes a step to the side, one hand behind her back, the other stretched to the front, gesturing to enter the room.

21	20		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Upon entering the room, the mechanical gears turn and the door closes.																						
22	21		301									In contrast to the brightness outside, most of the room is enveloped in darkness, making it impossible to gauge its size.																						
23	22		301									A cool draft circulates inside the central pipes, generating a shudder as it brushes against the neck.																						
24	23		302								(It doesn't appear to be as small as it appears.)	24																						
25	24		301									A tall, slim woman with blond hair stands amid numerous virtual screens, as if waiting for a long time.																						
26	25		201							1	1091001																							
27	26		301							1	Bianca	【kuroname】, welcome to KI.GAL Archives.	1																					
28	27		302								Should I say, "Long time, no see?"	28	This is my first time here.	29																				
29	28	27	301								Bianca	It's been a while. But now is not the time for small talk.	1																					
30	29		301								Bianca	Most people will never have the chance to visit here. They are neither willing nor entitled to be aware of its existence.	1																					
31	30		301								Chiko	Captain, this is the research data of the Virtual Horizon.																						
32	31		301									Chiko proceeds to unlock all of the suitcase's security locks before handing it over to Bianca.																						
33	32		301									A monolith-patterned mechanical arm emerges from the darkness, retrieving the contents from the suitcase, while thousands of pop-up windows hover around it.																						
34	33		301									Bianca swiftly scans the pop-up windows and then swipes the virtual screen to the side. The mechanical arm then vanishes into the darkness.																						
35	34		301								Bianca	I've added it to KI.GAL Archives. You may proceed to the next assignment.	1																					
36	35		301									Bianca then drags and taps on a virtual screen to transfer the data to Chiko's data terminal.																						
37	36		301								Chiko	Understood.																						
38	37		301									Chiko packs her suitcase and walks toward the door. She smiles and nods faintly as she walks past you.																						
39	38		302								Hmm?	39																						
40	39		301									The moving mechanical gears can be heard from behind. Before there is any time to consider the implication of Chiko's glance, Bianca first breaks the silence from afar.																						
41	40		301				DialogDisable				Bianca	Chiko has always been this way. Hope you don't mind.	1																					
42	41		302								She showed up in front of me, bringing President Hassen's order.	42																						
43	42		302								Then she brought me here without giving me a chance to argue.	43																						
44	43		302								It's difficult to ignore her.	44																						
45	44		301			DialogEnable					Bianca	I can only imagine.	1																					
46	45		301				DialogDisable				Bianca	Because of her past experiences, she finds it difficult to communicate with people. If she has offended you, please accept my apologies.	1																					
47	46		302								It's fine.	47																						
48	47		302								But I digress.	48																						
49	48		302								I wasn't expecting your archives room to be that gloomy.	49																						
50	49		301			DialogEnable					Bianca	This is more than just an archive room. It also keeps a record of the Purifying Force's targets.	1																					
51	50		302								Fully understood.	51	Your words have made me even more anxious.	53																				
52	51		301								Bianca	But that is not the message conveyed by your expression.	1																					
53	52		302								What was it, then?	59																						
54	53		301								Bianca	Relax. Your name is not on the target list.	1																					
55	54		302								Phew, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to walk out this door today.	55	For now.	57																				
56	55		301								Bianca	Hehe, you've definitely developed a better sense of humor.	1																					
57	56		302								What was it, then?	59																						
58	57		301								Bianca	I can guarantee your safety. For now.	1																					
59	58		302								What was it, then?	59																						
60	59		301								Bianca	The experiment record of Virtual Horizon and the recordings of some abnormal noises.	1																					
61	60		302								...	61	Those are not noises.	61																				
62	61		301								Bianca	Whatever they are, they have already been purified and will be held permanently within the core of Purifying Force. But...	1																					
63	62		302								It's not that simple?	64																						
64	63		204							1	4																							
65	64		301								Bianca	Right. There are still some unanswered questions. And then there's Commander Nikola's agenda...	1																					
66	65		302								Bianca, we are soldiers.	66																						
67	66		301								Bianca	...	1																					
68	67		301									Bianca shakes her head after a moment of futile contemplating, as if chasing the tangled thoughts out of her M.I.N.D.																						
69	68		301								Bianca	Soldiers must adhere to our superior's exact orders.	1																					
70	69		301								Bianca	Concerns and troubles, on the other hand, allow us to think rather than blindly follow.	1																					
71	70		302								That is what distinguishes us.	71																						
72	71		301								Bianca	Exactly, 【kuroname】. Reasonable questioning is also needed in the military.	1																					
73	72		301								Bianca	After you leave, I suppose I should talk with Commander Nikola.	1																					
74	73		302								That's the Bianca I know.	75																						
75	74		204							1																								
76	75		301									Bianca appears to have subsided after hearing your words, motioning you to stand by her side.																						
77	76		301								Bianca	Although there are many unanswered questions, at least the participants of Virtual Horizon are safe.	1																					
78	77		302								We may now close the chapter.	78																						
79	78		301								Bianca	Should we begin today's mission?	1																					
80	79		301								Bianca	President Hassen has not imposed a time limit for your viewing. It's fine if you want to take a longer break.	1																					
81	80		302								That's not necessary.	81																						
82	81		301								Bianca	You are right. It's not fair to keep the Gray Raven members waiting for too long.	1																					
83	82		301								Bianca	Then, let's get started. Now, display "KI.GAL Archives: False Words".	1																					
84	83		301									As Bianca speaks, a sea of data flashes on numerous half-transparent virtual screens that are hovering around you. At the heart of the data lies a common objective: Roland, the Ascendant.																						
85	84		301								Bianca	This is all of the data concerning Roland that the Purifying Force has gathered. Level Two access has been granted to you.	1																					
86	85		301								Bianca	It contains all the relevant footage, audios, and even rumors recorded by Babylonia squads, surface forces, and AI surveillances.	1																					
87	86		302								Thanks.	87

103	102		301								Palex	I'm about to enter Copperfield Estate. It's the eleventh hour since Gray Raven left the estate. Commencing the recycling mission.	1																					
104	103		301									The first scene is the familiar estate, where Gray Raven first met Roland.																						
105	104		301									Looks like the soldier named Palex was the one who cleaned up after that incident.																						
106	105		301									The soldier's weapon was designed to fire quick, muffled shots while emitting no visible sparks.																						
107	106		301									Palex was purging the estate's roaming Corrupted as he made his way to the center of the ruins.

115	114		301							1	Palex	Purification complete. The recycle item not found.	1

117	116		301								Palex	Who's there?!	1																					
118	117		301									The camera was quickly directed to the source of the voice. Slowly emerging from the shadows, the speaker tossed the item in his hand into mid-air and caught it again and again.																						
119	118		201							1	500008																							
120	119		301							1	Roland	Why don't you ask the grownups who are hiding behind your camera?	1

191	189		301									With their scarlet flames, two silver airdrop pods shattered the station's ceiling and crushed the platform, melting all Corrupted into a cluster of scrap in the immediate vicinity.

197	195		301								Construct A	I know. Because we are always the first ones to enter the battlefield.																						
198	196		301								Construct A	But, speaking of combat, it has only been thirty minutes after the Eternal Engine had passed through, and the place has already been overrun with Corrupted.																						
199	197		301								Construct B	Think about the train's passengers. We're up against a small fraction of the Corrupted, and the majority of them are on the train.																						
200	198		301								Construct A	Fair enough. The Gray Ravens, if my memory serves me well, were the ones who boarded the train.																						
201	199		301								Construct B	Yes, they are the only ones who can deal with the most challenging core.																						
202	200		301									The two Constructs kicked open the door of the airdrop pod, conversing via comms and covering each other.

235	233		301								Roland	Is that all?	1																					
236	234		301								Gabriel	Yes, that's all.	2																					
237	235		301								Gabriel	Your being here without informing anyone, on the other hand, raises a lot more suspicion.	2																					
238	236		301								Gabriel	What are you scheming?	2																					
239	237		301								Roland	Shouldn't you first demonstrate your sincerity before you place an inquiry?	1																					
240	238		301								Gabriel	This is not an inquiry. This is an interrogation.	2																					
241	239		301								Roland	Who gave you the right to interrogate me?	1																					
242	240		301								Gabriel	I'm taking the necessary precautions to ensure that parasites do not undermine the power of Ascension-Network.	2																					
243	241		301								Roland	Undermine the Ascension-Network, rather than Miss Luna? Maybe you're the parasite.	1																					
244	242		301								Gabriel	Your questioning is worthless, as Miss Luna epitomizes the power of Ascension-Network.	2																					
245	243		301								Roland	Will you still be loyal to Miss Luna if she loses her power?	1																					
246	244		301									Silence. The passage of time seemed to stretch on forever, and the station was filled with a suffocating quietness.																						
247	245		301									After a long while, Roland broke the silence first.																						
248	246		301								Roland	Don't worry. I'm just messing with you!	1																					
249	247		301								Gabriel	Humph, my actions speak louder than words. You, on the other hand, have some explaining to do.	2																					
250	248		301								Gabriel	Why didn't you finish off the Babylonia Constructs after you defeated them? The Construct near your feet is still alive, right?	2																					
251	249		301								Roland	Uh-oh, you got me!	1																					
252	250		202							1	2				1																			
253	251		301									Gabriel sprinted over to Roland, who was standing casually with his arms folded.																						
254	252		401							2	1543																							
255	253		301			RImgBg1Shake						Gabriel lowered his body and striked Roland in the stomach with a crushing blow. The sheer force of the strike even cracked the ground beneath their feet.																						
256	254		301									Gabriel had obliterated countless beings with this lethal close-quarters punch. Throughout this encounter, however, he never felt the anticipated impact flow through him.

258	256		301							1	Gabriel	H-how's that possible?	2

261	259		301							1		After the dust from the impact subsided, Roland could be seen with one foot on Gabriel's shoulder, maintaining his nonchalant pose.	1	2																				
262	260		301								Roland	Phew, that was close.	1																					
263	261		301								Gabriel	You have been hiding your true power.	2																					
264	262		301								Roland	Have I? I have no idea.	1																					
265	263		202							1					1																			
266	264		203							2	0.25																							
267	265		301									Roland then lept off Gabriel's shoulder and walked out of the station.																						
268	266		301								Roland	Okay, there concludes the excursion. I'll see you at the HQ.																						
269	267		301									Gabriel tidied up his robe and smashed the Construct on the ground into bits.																						
270	268		301								Gabriel	Roland...	2

272	270		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The ominous words echoed around the desolate station. The black-clad Ascendant walked into the depths of station.

276	274		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You have no idea how long has been spent perusing the files as the info continues to flood the thoughts.

278	276		301							1	Bianca	You've been reading the files for quite some time. What are your thoughts?	1																					
279	277		302								What is Roland's plan, exactly?	278																						
280	278		301								Bianca	I'm wondering the same thing.	1																					
281	279		301								Bianca	The more I go over the files, the more enigmatic he seems.	1																					
282	280		302								It's like sinking into a puddle of mud.	281																						
283	281		301								Bianca	Yes, it seems like his inner core is in a state of chaos.	1																					
284	282		301								Bianca	Also, take a look at the encounter records.	1																					
285	283		302								Our damages continue to go up...	284																						
286	284		301								Bianca	He uses a variety of methods, including dueling, commanding the Corrupted to strike, and assassinations. The battles, however, always end with our victory.	1																					
287	285		301								Bianca	As though everything has been choreographed.	1																					
288	286		302								It's beyond me.	287																						
289	287		301								Bianca	Agreed... But regardless of the truth, he remains a target to be eliminated.	1																					
290	288		301								Bianca	Now I'll show you a few battle scenarios when you encounter Roland. Are you ready?	1																					
291	289		302								What kind of battles?	290																						
292	290		301								Bianca	Various types. We'll demonstrate as many scenarios as possible.	1																					
293	291		301								Bianca	I've loaded the combat AI from Virtual Horizon into the system to let you adapt to the battle scenarios in KI.GAL Archives. Your experience may be similar to that of the experiment.	1																					
294	292		302								Understood. Then let's get started.	293
