6	6		301									The two of you take down another wave of Corrupted, and Vera's frame is overheating from the continuous intense fights.																						
7	7		302								Get indoors.	8																						
8	8		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Vera immediately understands what you mean. She picks you up and carries you over her shoulder, leaping into a building.

11	11		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The Corrupted pass by the building, unable to detect your signals.																						
12	12		301									As you have guessed, almost all buildings here are covered with radiation-absorbent material and built with special substances that isolate most usual signals. They are nearly invisible to a machine's "eyes."																						
13	13		301									Having gone through this immediate danger, Vera relaxes her tense self and sits down, leaning on the wall.																						
14	14		301									There is a deep cut on her arm, vital fluid slowly dripping out from the wound. She got it earlier protecting you.																						
15	15		301									She keeps saying she does not care for your safety, and yet you are unharmed, save for being exhausted from the difficult journey—she has kept you protected.																						
16	16		302								I'm sorry.	17	Are you okay?	20																				
17	17		201							1	500345	4																						
18	18		301							1	Vera	Shut up.	1																					
19	19	23	301								Vera	An apology that doesn't help our current situation means it's only to make you feel better.	1																					
20	20		201							1	500345	4																						
21	21		301							1	Vera	Do you think I look "okay"?	1																					
22	22		301								Vera	Now shush and let me cool down.	1																					
23	23		202							1					1																			
24	24		301									She leans on the wall, her artificial skin starting to turn red.																						
25	25		302								You...	26																						
26	26		201							1	500345	4																						
27	27		301							1		Before you say anything, Vera gives you a stare.																						
28	28		301								Vera	If you ask me if I'm feeling alright again, I promise you I'll throw you into the ocean.	1																					
29	29		202							1					1																			
30	30		301									You remain silent for a long time.																						
31	31		301									Having cooled her frame a bit, Vera takes a deep breath and starts treating her wound.																						
32	32		301									Unlike humans, most of Constructs' wounds are not lethal. But also unlike humans, their wounds do not heal themselves.																						
33	33		302								Do you need my help?	34	You look like an expert.	36																				
34	34		201							1	500345	4																						
35	35	40	301							1	Vera	No. You'd make it worse.	1																					
36	36		201							1	500345	4																						
37	37		301							1	Vera	Ha, you have no idea what I used to do.	1																					
38	38		202							1					1																			
39	39	41	301									Having said that, it does not seem like she is going to elaborate.																						
40	40		202							1					1																			
41	41		301									Vera quickly stops the "bleeding," and you are surprised to find her technique no less delicate and skilled than Liv's.																						
42	42		301									She fixes herself in no time.																						
43	43		302								I can help if you need me.	44																						
44	44		201							1	500345																							
45	45		301							1	Vera	...Is the true measure of a Chief being relentless or having incredibly thick skin?	1																					
46	46		301									She looks at you, and this time she speaks unprompted.																						
47	47		204							1	4																							
48	48		301								Vera	I just think that everything we're doing now is stupid and meaningless.	1																					
49	49		301								Vera	The Parliament... Kurono... and this mission are all stupid to their core.	1																					
50	50		301								Vera	All those calculated men are so damn stupid. They will not stop fighting each other even when everything is at stake.	1																					
51	51		301								Vera	I am stupid too for telling you this.	1																					
52	52		302								You think this mission is pointless.	53	You are angry.	59																				
53	53		301									Vera looks up.																						
54	54		301								Vera	What do you think the point is?	1																					
55	55		301								Vera	If you understand the Parliament and Kurono enough, you will understand why they are all dancing around you.	1																					
56	56		301								Vera	Kurono wants to lock you up for conspiring with the enemy. The Parliament wants you to sacrifice everything for the fate of humanity.	1																					
57	57		301								Vera	They're both trying to rob you and bleed you dry.	1																					
58	58	62	301								Vera	One of them is blatant with their intentions, the other one decorates it with righteous causes.	1																					
59	59		301									Vera looks up.																						
60	60		301								Vera	Of course I'm angry. Not just at all of these—I'm angry at myself for having to do it anyway.	1																					
61	61		301								Vera	Has Gray Raven been through so little, or are you just so damn naive?	1																					
62	62		301								Vera	Everyone knows the Punishing Virus comes from within the zero-point reactor. We're already paying the price, and look where we are.	1																					
63	63		301								Vera	How ironic to have us investigate a place like this. Don't they know how the world ended? Do they want a sequel already?	1																					
64	64		204							1	8																							
65	65		301									She closes her eyes.																						
66	66		301									The soldiers crying on their death beds, the comrades falling before her eyes... Her memories of the past and their pain flood her mind.																						
67	67		204							1	4																							
68	68		301								Vera	I thought the Parliament would be better than Kurono at the very least. Surprise! They're also morons who tempt fate.	1																					
69	69		301								Vera	Poking at something so dangerous just to counter the opponent.	1																					
70	70		302								You think we should leave zero-point energy alone?	71																						
71	71		301								Vera	I don't "think." I "know" it for a fact.	1																					
72	72		301								Vera	Can you deny that it was what started all of this?	1																					
73	73		301									You cannot refute her words.																						
74	74		301									That is a fact like she has said.																						
75	75		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Humans have long died on the road to their ambitions. This city is just a graveyard for their arrogance.
