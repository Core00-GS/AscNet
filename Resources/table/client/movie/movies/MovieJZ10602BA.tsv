6	6		301								Kamui	Don't you worry, I know what to do.	1																					
7	7		301								Koya	Looks like someone's looking forward to the next mission.	2																					
8	8		301								Kamui	Of course, I've been trained for so long just for the upcoming battle.	1																					
9	9		301								Koya	That is why we Constructs were created after all.	2																					
10	10		301								Koya	But I haven't been to a battlefield yet, and I don't know if I can adapt to it.	2

12	12		301								Kamui	Don't worry, since humans created us to defend the earth, we can certainly fight!	1

14	14		301								Koya	Haha, you have a point.	2																					
15	15		301								Koya	Speaking of the battle power, the two people you just talked to seem to be very strong Constructs.	2																					
16	16		301								Kamui	Of course they do. Lucia and Watanabe are well-experienced Constructs. They have been through a lot of battles, and they are pure Attacker Constructs.	1																					
17	17		301								Kamui	But I won't lose to them either!	1																					
18	18		301								Koya	Let's hope that I can be assigned to the same batch with them later, so that I can gain a lot of combat experience from them in close range.	2																					
19	19		301								Kamui	True that!	1																					
20	20		301								Kamui	But I think you're strong, too, Koya. I'd like to spar with you if I ever get the chance.	1																					
21	21		301								Koya	Haha, I just hope that I won't be a burden.	2																					
22	22		301								Kamui	That won't be the case. The Constructs are powerful, so you must be powerful too!	1																					
23	23		301								Koya	Let's hope so.	2																					
24	24		301								Koya	It's time to assemble. Let's go now.	2
