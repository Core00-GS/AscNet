8	8		301								Lucia	Yeah, I was planning to take another direction if there was no exit. Just don't stay still.	1																					
9	9		301									We followed Lucia through the underground facility back to the surface. But it wasn't as peaceful as the villages we visited previously.

15	12		301									Many people were injured. There was heavy smoke from burning buildings, and bomb craters that smelled like chemicals.

23	15		301							1	Kamui	Excuse me! What happened here?	1																					
24	16		301									Lee was still thinking, but Kamui had already joined the rescue team and started asking around.																						
25	17		301								Villager	Who are you... Did you also come from other villages?	2																					
26	3009		201							1	500166		400																					
27	18		301								Lucia	No, we are travelers.	1																					
28	19		301								Villager	Traveler? Are you looking for somewhere to stay? But our village was already destroyed by the King's heroes.	2																					
29	3010		302								What heroes...?	20	Why would the King burn your village?	21																				
30	20	3011	301								Villager	It was those two minions of the King. They took all our family, as well as the Demons who lived with us in harmony...	2																					
31	21	1001	301								Villager	Because we didn't follow the King's order to kill all Demons, but lived with them instead.	2																					
32	1001	22	201							1	500173		400																					
33	22	23	301								Lee	I thought you had been living like this for a long time?	1																					
34	23	3011	301								Villager	Yes, and we thought we could get by again... But the heroes immediately found out where we were hiding the Demons, and...	2																					
35	3011		202							1	2																							
36	24		301									The villager started to weep. The Demons seized by the "heroes" must be very close to him.

46	3018		201							2	500173		-400																					
47	28		301							1	Lee	Probably. But I don't think they would purposely run errands for that King. There must be a reason behind.	2																					
48	3020		302								Liv?	4001	The Goddess' artifact.	2001

54	4006	4007	301							1	Karenina	Not necessarily. Maybe they were just setting it up. Bianca once taught me a strange tactic specifically designed for pursuit.	2																					
55	4007	4008	301								Karenina	The goal is to apply continuous pressure and reduce the space. If the target isn't here, it doesn't matter—just blow everything up and set up traps.	2																					
56	4008	4009	301								Karenina	It gives the target pressure and keeps them away from this place.	2

58	4010	4011	201							1	500173																							
59	4011	4012	301							1	Lee	Creating danger to limit the target's movement, and force them to go to the only safe place left. Is that what they doing?	1																					
60	4012	4013	102							1	500180																							
61	4013	4014	301							1	Karenina	Yeah... I'm not sure about that Camu guy, but Vera will definitely do it.	1

63	4015		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Lucia	Let's follow this tactic and look for Liv. We may bump into the King's forces, but this is the fastest way to find her.	1

65	2002	36	201							1	500166																							
66	36	2003	301							1	Lucia	It's possible. This village may be on the way to some Demon General's Castle.	1

68	2004	37	201							2	500180	5	-400																					
69	37	2005	301							1	Karenina	Vera was asking us to collect recovery potions in every village we passed by. Maybe she just did it a bit over this time.	2																					
70	2005	38	201							1	1081001	1	400																					
71	38	39	301							1	Kamui	Hmm... But Camu would never do unnecessary things like that.	1																					
72	39	40	301								Karenina	I thought he was as evil as Vera.	2																					
73	40	41	301								Kamui	He's just antisocial. But he would never burn a village down just because he joined the King's side.	1																					
74	41	2006	301								Kamui	I mean, it wasn't part of your quest, right?	1																					
75	2006	42	201							1	500166		400																					
76	42	43	301								Lucia	Unnecessary... Kamui knows Camu the best. If he says so...	1																					
77	43	44	301								Lucia	Perhaps burning the village down was for another objective.	1																					
78	44	45	301								Karenina	Do you mean Liv!?	2																					
79	45		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Yeah. We don't know what they are planning, but we need to move fast.	1
