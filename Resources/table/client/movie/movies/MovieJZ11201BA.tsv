7	6		301									When Chrome is deep in thought, Kamui is always the one to interrupt him. It's been like this ever since Chrome first took over his current position.																						
8	7		301									The squad "Strike Hawk" is as outstanding as rumors have it. Each member has their own specialties and they work excellently alone.																						
9	8		301								Chrome	Kamui, didn't I tell you to return to your position after 30 minutes of preparation?	3																					
10	9		301								Kamui	But what's the point of taking apart the weapons and putting them back again?	2																					
11	10		301								Chrome	Understanding your equipment, down to the last nut and bolt, then using them to their fullest potential... That's what Smith would have done.	3																					
12	11		301								Kamui	Smith... That name again. But you're Captain Chrome, not Captain Smith, now are you?	2																					
13	12		301									Chrome's finger pauses on the screen. He looks up at Kamui.																						
14	13		301								Chrome	I'm trying to become him.	3																					
15	14		301								Kamui	Really...? If that's what you wish, I'll try to help you fulfill it.	2

17	16		301								Kamui	Yeah. We're pals, right?	2																					
18	17		301									In the end, Chrome forces Kamui to return to his position (he's the leader, after all), and goes back to leafing through the mission details from "Smith".

37	998		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryTongxunNew.prefab																							
38	33		301								Langston	Understood.																						
39	34		301								Langston	According to the latest research report from the Science Council, there are currently two types of connection technology used in the military.																						
40	991		301								Langston	One type is the Connection Chamber, which allows Commandants to connect to the M.I.N.D. of Constructs without the restrictions of distance. Commandants will be able to sync up with the Constructs and command them directly. This is the most commonly employed connection combat method currently.																						
41	35		301								Langston	The other is commandants fighting alongside the Constructs, using Inver-Devices and human Mind Beacons for short-distance connection and positioning. Yet this is rarely employed nowadays due to its many restrictions.

45	37		301								Course System	Question two: Please perform a brief analysis on the principles of application of the connection technology for Commandants and Military Constructs.

47	38		301								Langston	After the "Gestalt" system became widely applied in the public sphere, human knowledge was continually uploaded, making highly efficient and fully objective decisions possible.																						
48	992		301								Langston	Studies related to the human brain have been filed as special secret research projects by the Science Council due to how complicated they are.																						
49	39		301								Langston	According to the accessible early research data, each human brain contains about 100 billion neurons, capable of forming over 100 trillion connections.																						
50	993		301								Langston	The neurons in human brains can output electric signals via dendrites. Which means that—																						
51	40		301								Whispering	Is that... Langston Smith?																						
52	41		301								Whispering	The current student representative?																						
53	42		301								Whispering	Smith... Someone with this last name... Should probably be related to Officer Smith, hm?																						
54	43		301								Whispering	Son of an officer, student representative, a true genius... He's even got a pretty face... Ugh, some people really have everything!																						
55	44		301								Langston	...Meanwhile, Commandant can better stabilize the abnormal fluctuations in the Construct's M.I.N.D. via the consciousness connection technology.

61	47		301								Langston	Collect as much information as possible and analyze it. As the density of Punishing Virus is related to certain geographical elements, I may perhaps use a Gauss–Krüger projection to determine—																						
62	48		301								Whispering	As expected from our top student. I heard there are only three slots for the Reserve Commandant Draft at the end of the month... Guess he's definitely gonna take one of the slots.
