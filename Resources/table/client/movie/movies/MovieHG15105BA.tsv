21	20		302								Fine, fine...	21																						
22	21		301								Camu	I can unleash more of my harder moves now. You've exceeded my expectations, Commandant.	1																					
23	22		302								I don't get excited because of your compliments either.	23																						
24	23		301								Camu	Oh yeah? You should be sobbing in gratitude to have my approval.	1																					
25	24		301								Camu	I'll soon be able to stand on the battlefield with those Constructs, yeah?	1

33	31		301									Camu freezes, as if shocked by your action.																						
34	32		301									His face scrunches up, as if he just drank a tequila with salted lemon slices. He seems to be pondering whether to punch you or thank you.

45	43		301								Camu	I'm technically not even a member of Gray Raven. Why do I have to come to this presentation?	1																					
46	44		302								Let's get something to eat after this, on me.	45	Just sit it out.	47																				
47	45		301								Camu	In that case, I'm getting golden egg fried rice, the nightmare spicy one.	1																					
48	46		302								Sure thing.	51

59	56		301									Camu does not look too happy. You seem to have become better at sensing his discomfort after spending all this time with him.																						
60	57		302								It'll be over in no time.	58	Sorry, you'll just have to endure it.	59																				
61	58	61	301								Camu	...Hey, scoot over. I want the seat next to yours.	1																					
62	59		301								Camu	Stop apologizing. You're a Commandant. Commandants don't apologize.	1																					
63	60		301								Camu	And it's not like I'm worried about the crowds. It's just that I saw some pieces of trash there.	1																					
64	61		202							1																								
65	555		401							1	201

67	63		201						1000	1	500028																							
68	64		301									They are sitting one row behind you. For some reason, their commandant is absent. You immediately recognize the tall, broad brunet tank-type Construct, one of the three you encountered the other day.																						
69	65		202							1																								
70	66		301									You accidentally meet his eyes while peering at him and quickly look away.																						
71	67		201							1	500175	5																						
72	68		301							1	Camu	Tch, what a buzzkill.	1																					
73	69		302								Don't mind them.	70	Let's get food as soon as this is over.	70																				
74	70		202							1																								
75	71		301									Camu forces himself to sit back tight and stop fidgeting.																						
76	72		301									You thought the presentation would end uneventfully until someone taps you on the back.																						
77	73		302								...?	74																						
78	74		301									You turn around and almost knock into the Construct, who is leaning forward.																						
79	75		201							1	500028																							
80	76		301							1	Tank-type Construct	Hey. Small world, huh?	1																					
81	77		301								Tank-type Construct	Didn't expect to run into you guys here.	1																					
82	78		302								Anything you want?	79	I'm in no mood to fight with you guys.	79																				
83	79		301								Tank-type Construct	So he lied, huh? You're indeed his commandant?	1																					
84	80		302								What are you trying to say?	81	Yes, I'm his commandant.	83																				
85	81		301								Tank-type Construct	My commandant got injured and reported, but nothing happened to YOU.	1																					
86	82	85	301								Tank-type Construct	Very unfair, don't you think?	1																					
87	83		301								Tank-type Construct	So you admitted to it just like that...	1																					
88	84		301								Tank-type Construct	Like Commandant, like squad member. You're really more of a scumbag than you look.	1																					
89	85		202							1																								
90	86		301									Camu, who has remained quiet, finally speaks.																						
91	87		201							1	500175	5																						
92	88		301			PanelActor1Shake					Camu	Bastard, if you say one more word—	1																					
93	213020		202							1					1																			
94	89		301									The veins on Camu's forehead are throbbing as he clenches his fists.																						
95	90		302								(Reprimand him quietly)	91	(Push his fist back down)	94																				
96	91		201							1	500028																							
97	92		301							1	Tank-type Construct	Hm, your Corrupted seems quite docile today. How did you manage to tame him?	1																					
98	93		302								Please stop speaking.	94	Calm down, Camu.	94																				
99	94		202							1																								
100	95		301									All elite squads of Babylonia are present in the conference hall. Hassen is delivering his speech up there on the stage.																						
101	96		301									Camu is like a bomb that could go off any moment, but you really do not want him to get into trouble. It is already hard enough for him to stay still in the crowd when so many unfriendly eyes are on him.																						
102	97		301									No matter what, you cannot allow another fight to break out.																						
103	98		302								What do you want?	99																						
104	99		201							1	500028																							
105	100		301							1	Tank-type Construct	Apologize to my commandant.	1

107	102		301							1	Camu	...	1																					
108	103		301									You hear Camu take a sharp breath and quickly interject before he can explode.																						
109	104		302								I apologi—	105																						
110	105		301								Camu	I'm sorry.	1																					
111	106		302								...?	107																						
112	107		201							1	500028																							
113	108		301							1	Tank-type Construct	If you don't apologize, I'll—uh, what?	1																					
114	109		201							1	500175	5																						
115	110		301							1	Camu	You want an apology, right? I'm sorry.	1																					
116	111		301								Camu	Want us to visit your commandant with flowers later?	1																					
117	112		201							1	500028																							
118	113		301							1	Tank-type Construct	Uh... You...	1

120	115		202							1																								
121	116		301									Camu simply smirks, maliciously.																						
122	118		201							1	500175	1																						
123	119		301							1	Camu	Don't get me wrong, I don't feel sorry at all for punching your idiot Commandant. If given the chance, I'd have thrown a few more punches.	1																					
124	120		301								Camu	I apologized only because my commandant wanted me to.	1																					
125	117		401							1	205																							
126	121		201							1	500028																							
127	122		301							1	Tank-type Construct	...Huh?	1																					
128	123		301									The Construct turns to you, confused.																						
129	124		302								(I have no idea what's going on either!)	125	(He must've misunderstood our relationship...)	125																				
130	125		201							1	500175	1																						
131	126		301							1	Camu	I obey every single word of my commandant's. Now, I wonder if YOUR commandant would like it if you start a fight with a Corrupted on the conference?	1																					
132	127		301								Camu	If I were you, I'd do the sensible thing and shut up.	1																					
133	128		301								Camu	After all, if my commandant weren't beside me... who knows what I'd do to any unattended figures.	1																					
134	129		201							1	500028																							
135	130		301							1	Tank-type Construct	A-are you threatening me now?	1																					
136	131		201							1	500175	1																						
137	132		301							1	Camu	Yep. You'd better pray that my dear commandant is by my side every time you and I meet in the future.	1																					
138	133		204							1	5																							
139	134		301								Camu	Or I promise to chop your head off as soon as I spot you.	1																					
140	135		302								Ahem...	136	Camu, that's enough.	137																				
141	136	138	301								Camu	You need something, Commandant?	1																					
142	137		301								Camu	I'll stop since my commandant said so.	1																					
143	138		202							1																								
144	139		301									The Construct stares, eyes wide in fear. You have no idea if he is feeling threatened by Camu's words or his strangely affectionate actions.																						
145	140		301									After that, the Construct leaves in a hurry.																						
146	141		201							1	500175																							
147	142		301							1	Camu	That's all he's got? What a wuss.	1																					
148	143		302								(Chuckle)	144	You really scared me back there.	152																				
149	144		301								Camu	?	1																					
150	145		302								Say it again.	146																						
151	146		301								Camu	Say what? Idiot?	1																					
152	147		302								Not that.	148																						
153	148		301								Camu	Oh. You mean dear Command—	1																					
154	149		301								Camu	—You really think I'd call you that?	1																					
155	150		301								Camu	I was just being mushy on purpose to weird him out. I learned this tactic from you humans.	1																					
156	151	159	301								Camu	Don't flatter yourself.	1																					
157	152		301								Camu	You mean when I said I'd chop off that Construct's head?	1																					
158	153		302								No, when you called me dear Commandant.	154																						
159	154		301								Camu	Oh? You like it when I call you that?	1																					
160	155		301								Camu	Dear Command—	1																					
161	156		301								Camu	—You really think I'd call you that?	1																					
162	157		301								Camu	Don't flatter yourself.	1																					
163	158		301								Camu	I was just being mushy on purpose to weird him out.	1																					
164	159		301								Camu	I hate those ranks and titles.	1																					
165	160		301								Camu	I'll just call you 【kuroname】. Or Gross. Short for Gray Raven's Boss.	1																					
166	161		302								No way.	162	Do whatever you want.	164																				
167	162		301								Camu	What about "my bosom friend" then?	1																					
168	163	165	301								Camu	Sounds weird too...	1																					
169	164		301								Camu	That sounds weird now that I'm thinking about it...	1																					
170	165		301								Camu	I'll think it over and let you know when I decide what to call you.	1																					
171	166		302								Sure.	167	I have my right to reject the name if it sucks.	167

176	171		301							1	Camu	...	1																					
177	172		301								Camu	...Your hand.	1																					
178	173		302								Huh?	174																						
179	174		301								Camu	Your hand... It was warm.	1																					
180	175		302								I'm a human.	176	It's called body temperature.	176																				
181	444		401							1	208																							
182	176		301								Camu	I know. It's just been a long time since I last felt that.	1																					
183	177		301								Camu	We don't have the senses of taste and touch in our M.I.N.D.	1																					
184	178		302								(Grab his hand)	179	(Extend your hand)	179																				
185	179		301								Camu	...!	1																					
186	180		302								Feel it all you want.	181																						
187	181		301								Camu	...It really is warm.	1																					
188	182		302								Of course it is.	183																						
189	183		301								Camu	It's soft, too... unlike other things that radiate heat.	1																					
190	184		301									Camu's fist relaxes as he murmurs, letting your human hand land in his robotic one. For some reason, even a Construct like him can sense the warmth from your skin.																						
191	185		301								Camu	So that's how it feels to have a body.	1																					
192	186		301									Camu closes his eyes, as if trying his best to remember this moment.																						
193	187		301								Camu	I used to be a human once upon a time. But all I remember in my M.I.N.D. is something cold... and horrid.	1																					
194	188		301								Camu	I feel much better in my current form. More powerful, much safer.	1																					
195	189		301								Camu	But... it's still the first time I've touched the human body in a while.	1																					
196	190		302								You'll have lots of chances to experience that again.	191																						
197	191		301								Camu	In that case...	1																					
198	888		204							1	1																							
199	192		301								Camu	When are we gonna go get that golden egg fried rice, nightmare spicy?	1																					
200	193		302								You sure remember stuff like that well.	198	Are you sure you can really eat that much?	194																				
201	885		204							1																								
202	194		301								Camu	You're the only one who'll gain weight from that anyway.	1																					
203	195		302								Come on!	196	What's the point of eating then?	196																				
204	196		301								Camu	Human food might not provide me energy, nor will it stimulate my taste buds the same way it does to humans'...	1																					
205	197		301								Camu	But I like it.	1																					
206	198		301									The youth snorts, crossing his arms in front of his chest.																						
207	886		204							1																								
208	199		301								Camu	Hey, you won't go back on your promise, huh?	1																					
209	200		302								Of course not.	201	Let's go, then.	202																				
210	201		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Camu	I knew you wouldn't dare.	1																					
211	202		301								Camu	...Now?	1																					
212	203		302								Yeah	204	Or do you want to stay and listen to Hassen droning on all week?	204																				
213	204		301								Camu	Rulebreaker much?	1																					
214	205		302								Kinda.	206	Only doing it because of you.	206																				
215	206		202							1																								
216	207		301									The corners of Camu's lips twitch a little. The two of you bend down in the back row as the presentation goes on and sneak out behind the chairs.																						
217	208		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					You feel a stern gaze from the podium as you sneak out, but... who cares?
