3	3		301			DialogEnable						The sun sets, and the CPF hums in the silent night. As the reconstruction effort progresses steadily and with the resources gradually arriving, the residents of the conservation area no longer sleep in fear.																						
4	4		301									It is a full moon tonight. With the sky looking brighter than usual, the children are allowed to play outside for a little longer while those who have finished their work gather in small groups around simple campfires.																						
5	5		301									Before you realize it, you are surrounded by children, their blinking and twinkling eyes widening as you tell your heroic tales in the Task Force.																						
6	6		301									Not all your stories are suitable for them, however. They have seen enough cruelty even at their age.

11	11		301							1	Supervisor	What are you guys talking about? It sounds fun. Mind if I join you?	1																					
12	12		301									The supervisor arrives with a pot of cold stew, sitting next to the children.																						
13	13		302								Just telling them stories.	14

17	17		301							1	Jonathan	Lee can hit an auto turret of the Corrupted from 800 miles away! Twice!	1																					
18	18		301									Jonathan jumps up, spinning the small plastic pistol in his hand before blowing at the tip of the barrel.																						
19	19		301								Kelly	Lucia's sword dance can freeze a room!	2																					
20	20		301									Kelly makes a convincing stance with her wooden sword. You recall the supervisor telling you that she has been practicing combat techniques ever since she was rescued.																						
21	21		301								Burton	Liv can fly and control eight Levi-Guns at the same time!	3																					
22	22		301									The children relate the stories of Gray Raven to the supervisor, each one adding their flourishes. The supervisor chuckles as the stories go on, his tiredness swept away from the warmth by this campfire.

24	24		301									Except...																						
25	25		302								That wasn't what I said!	26	They're exaggerating.	27																				
26	26	28	301									You cannot help but be impressed by the children's creativity...																						
27	27		301									Especially the part where Liv performed a suplex on a Musashi IX.																						
28	28		301									Still, you are giggling like the rest of the people by the fire.

33	33		202							1					1																			
34	34		301									Wright dances around in his seat with his drone in his arms. That is when you notice that someone has painted an angry rabbit on the small machine.																						
35	35		301									You immediately think of the raging expression of a certain individual and how her rabbit-ear-shaped Inver-Devices flip over.																						
36	36		302								It does look quite similar...	37																						
37	37		301								???	Similar to what?																						
38	38		302								To Karen...	39																						
39	39		301								???	What?!																						
40	40		301									Even her angry screams sound like... Wait a minute.																						
41	41		201							1	500494	4																						
42	42		301							1		You quickly turn around to find Karenina standing behind you with a look as furious as the little rabbit on the drone.																						
43	43		201							1	500259																							
44	44		301							1	Jonathan	Karenina is here!	1

46	46		201							1	500494	13																						
47	47		301							1		You promptly deny any wrongdoings on your part. Fortunately, she does not look angry anymore, only tilting her head in confusion.	1																					
48	48		301									The engineer behind her, however, is chuckling quietly. Noticing your gaze, he pretends to cough before giving you a huge thumbs-up.																						
49	49		302								...																							
50	50		301								Karenina	Baffling... Whatever!	1																					
51	51		301								Karenina	The supervisor said you were looking for me?	1																					
52	52		302								Yeah, I was waiting for you.	53																						
53	53		302								There's somewhere I want to take you.	54																						
54	54		201							1	500164			-100	75																			
55	55		301							1	Wright	Where is it? I want to go too! I want to...	1																					
56	56		301									Wright springs up energetically, only to be held back by the supervisor before he can finish speaking.																						
57	57		201							1	500361																							
58	58		301							1	Engineer	Don't be a third wheel on their date, you little punk.	1

60	60		301							1	Karenina	...Date...	1																					
61	61		204							1	4																							
62	62		301									Karenina's expression shifts. Stoically she turns to you, her face screaming, "Explain immediately."																						
63	63		302								That's not what it is...	64	I suppose you can call it that.	66																				
64	64		301								Karenina	...Oh.	1																					
65	65	67	301									You were hoping to explain yourself, worrying that she would get upset, but Karenina looks even angrier right now...																						
66	66		301									Her expression does not change, but her Inver-Devices stand up in a snap.																						
67	67		204							1	6																							
68	68		301								Karenina	Jeez! Move! Start walking!	1																					
69	69		301									Going for broke, Karenina grabs your hand and heads out. Without the light from the fire, you can only see the slight hint of red that frames her ears.																						
70	70		302								Well...	71																						
71	71		301								Karenina	What?!	1																					
72	72		301									Without turning around, Karenina keeps walking straight with your hand in hers.																						
73	73		302								We're heading the wrong way. It should be that direction...	74																						
74	74		204							1	4

81	81		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						You lead Karenina to the fairground, stopping before the Ferris wheel.																						
82	82		201							1	500494	13																						
83	83		301							1	Karenina	Why did you take me here?	1																					
84	84		302								Hold on. Stay here.	85																						
85	85		202							1					1																			
86	86		301									You head to the control room and make one final safety check before initiating the power system of the Ferris wheel step by step.																						
87	87		301									You have rehearsed it with the engineer once already, but you cannot help but feel nervous right now.

91	91		301									Karenina hears the familiar sound of giant machinery running and finds herself bathed in light.																						
92	92		301									The sleeping Ferris wheel begins to spin. Kaleidoscopic neon lights brighten the night sky, illuminating the desolate fairground.																						
93	93		301									A breeze gently caresses Karenina's face. She finds herself inside a fairy tale.																						
94	94		201							1	500494	7

105	105		302								Is it possible?	106																						
106	106		301								Engineer	Hmm... Captain was right. Machines of this scale often come with their own power system.	1																					
107	107		301								Engineer	That Ferris wheel is in pretty good condition. Pretty sturdy too. Shouldn't be too difficult to make it run again.	1																					
108	108		302								Can you show me how?	109																						
109	109		301								Engineer	Sure.	1																					
110	110		301								Engineer	Let's give Captain a surprise!	1																					
111	111		302								I'm sorry to bother you when you're all so busy...	112																						
112	112		301								Engineer	That's alright. This isn't anything complicated.	1																					
113	113		301								Engineer	Not to mention that Captain has completed several reconstruction plans all by herself... We're actually quite free at the moment.	1																					
114	114		301									The engineer scratches his head and grins, shamefaced.

132	132		301									The conservation area turns into small blocks, the horizon in the distance fading in and out. You might be used to seeing the surface in a bird's eye view, but this slow and calming climb is giving you new perspectives.																						
133	133		301									As if, for a brief moment, this small corner of the world is free from dangers and worries.																						
134	134		201							1	500494	13																						
135	135		301							1	Karenina	Why did you want to fix the Ferris wheel?	1																					
136	136		302								I wanted to show you this.	137																						
137	137		301									You point to the horizon.																						
138	138		301									Repaired street lamps and reconstruction sites pave the space between the conservation area and the CPF... Warm lights shine where people are, twinkling like stars, forming an unbreakable net, connecting and extending.																						
139	139		302								The lights.	140																						
140	140		301								Karenina	Lights...	1																					
141	141		302								There are more of them now, aren't there?	142																						
142	142		301									Staring at the stars underneath her, Karenina understands what you are trying to say.																						
143	143		301								Karenina	Grandpa once told me that cities in the Golden Age shone even at night. They were so bright that you could see them from space.	1																					
144	144		301								Karenina	But the earth I saw on Babylonia after I became a Construct has always been shrouded in darkness...	1																					
145	145		302								But that's changing now.	146																						
146	146		301									Your cabin stops briefly as it reaches the top of the Ferris wheel, and the whole city lays bare before you. Karenina places her hands on the fence and looks into the distance.

148	148		301								Karenina	Hey! Look at that!	1																					
149	149		301								Karenina	Once that highway is fixed, we can transport supplies between those three nodes.	1																					
150	150		301								Karenina	Conservation area 073 has a sizable farm. The temporary hospital here is almost complete. The power station to the west has started working.	1																					
151	151		204							1	1																							
152	152		301								Karenina	People can be self-sufficient by exchanging resources between the different nodes.	1																					
153	153		301								Karenina	The dots connect into lines... and the lines form planes. As if passing a torch from one to another, they will soon light up this world again.	1																					
154	154		301									She holds out her hand as though she wants to grasp the lights below. Karenina grins, her eyes glistening with pride.																						
155	155		301								Karenina	But... I won't be satisfied!	1																					
156	156		301								Karenina	One day, we will retake our home and put a light on every corner of every city! The Engineering Force will not stop fighting! Not now, not ever!	1																					
157	157		301									Karenina lets out her grand visions, her eyes radiating with a fire more fierce than any flame.																						
158	158		204							1	4																							
159	159		301								Karenina	W-why are you looking at me like that?!	1																					
160	160		302								I think you're cool.	161	I think you're adorable.	161																				
161	161		301								Karenina	Hmph... Did you just notice it now? Better late than never, I suppose.	1																					
162	162		301								Karenina	I'll do even better in the future, so watch carefully!	1																					
163	163		302								I won't just watch.	164

166	166		301								Karenina	...	1

172	172		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Your passenger car soon reaches the ground once again. In the distance, a few children are dragging the engineer and the supervisor toward here. You reckon they have seen the Ferris wheel and all its lights turning on.																						
173	173		201							1	500494	13																						
174	174		301							1	Karenina	Way too fast...	1
