7	7		301								Forsaken Soldier	Report! I believe he's... still at the original HQ.	2																					
8	8		301								Forsaken Soldier	He did not retreat in time, because he was trying to protect the foodstuffs Watanabe-San had procured earlier.	2																					
9	9		301								Watanabe	...	1																					
10	10		301								Watanabe	All of you, stay here. I'll bring that idiot back here.	1

13	13		301							1	Changyu	I see nothing but Corrupted over there. How will you get the soldier out when you don't even have his coordinates? Not to mention, he could already be...	1																					
14	14		202							1																								
15	15		301									"He's probably already dead," Changyu almost said, before holding his tongue.

17	17		301							1	Watanabe	No Forsaken gets left behind...	1

19	19		301									With those words, Watanabe disappears alone into the yellow sands.																						
20	20		201							1	500124																							
21	21		301							1	Changyu	Sigh... these Forsaken people never listen.	1

26	26		301							1	Liv	But with Watanabe-San alone, I calculate the odds of successfully rescuing the trapped soldier to be 7.28%...	1																					
27	27		201							1	500026																							
28	28		301							1	Lee	Though I disagree with meddling in the affairs of the Forsaken, it is highly unusual that the Corrupted would assault Forsaken HQ in such numbers.	1																					
29	29		201							1	500166																							
30	30		301							1	Lucia	This line of investigation may very well lead to our objective.	1																					
31	31		201							1	500124																							
32	32		301							1	Changyu	Akdelik containers are equipped with communication devices. If the Corrupted could find this place by tracking comm signals, they could find the Eternal Engine next...	1																					
33	33		201							1	500026																							
34	34		301							1	Lee	That would be problematic. We must come up with a plan to retrieve the container.	1																					
35	35		302								We can use the comm device	36	Liv, can you trace the signal?	37																				
36	36		301								Lee	Ah, that reminds me, Commandant. Liv, can you trace the signal from the lost container?	1																					
37	37		201							1	1031001	7																						
38	38		301							1	Liv	I can try. Changyu, could you give me the lost container's comm signature?	1																					
39	39		201							1	500124																							
40	40		301							1	Changyu	Sure, but can you really find it with that?	1																					
41	41		201							1	500026																							
42	42		301							1	Lee	Have some faith in Liv. If she can't find it, no one can.	1																					
43	43		202							1																								
44	44		301									Closing her eyes, Liv conducts a thorough search. In an instant, her eyes reopen.

47	47		301							1	Liv	Found you! The signal is weak, but map coordinates are confirmed.	1																					
48	48		301								Lee	Strictly speaking, however, Gray Raven is acting in an assistant capacity to the ACA. Your decision, Changyu, will infleunce our plan of action.	2

50	50		301									Changyu understands that the decision, with the full weight of the Akdeliks behind it, rests on his shoulders.

52	52		301							1	Changyu	Mistress Jamilah always said that the essence of trade is cooperation, competition, and interaction, even though the Forsaken have never been the best trading partners.	1																					
53	53		301								Changyu	But just as the Forsaken do not leave their own behind, so too will the Akdeliks hold onto partners who hold potential.	1																					
54	54		201							1	500166	1																						
55	55		301							1	Lucia	It seems we have reached a conclusion, Commandant.	1
