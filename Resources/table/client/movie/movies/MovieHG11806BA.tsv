6	6		301									The sound of explosions, the screams of the Corrupted... all sorts of sounds fill your mind. Your gun-holding arm has gone numb as you struggle against the Corrupted pouncing on you like demons crawling out of hell.																						
7	7		301									Once again, you are standing on the battlefield on your own.																						
8	8		301								System	Control center dispatching reinforcements for mission H24-65. Supporting: 【kuroname】. Corrupted signals fast approaching in the quarantine zone. Please be aware.																						
9	9		301									Only this time, you are the person being rescued.																						
10	10		301									This is not uncommon on the battlefield, and you may be a little exhausted by it.																						
11	11		301								System	The nearest reinforcement will arrive in 6 minutes.																						
12	12		301								???	Wanshi of Strike Hawk has arrived on site.																						
13	13		301									You hear a familiar voice from behind. Looking back in surprise, you find Wanshi speaking to the comms.																						
14	14		201							1	500273	4																						
15	15		301							1	Wanshi	Can you still get in touch with the Gray Ravens?	1																					
16	16		302								Yeah, they're on their way here.	17																						
17	17		301								Wanshi	Let's go up.	1																					
18	18		302								Were you nearby this time as well?																							
19	19		301								Wanshi	Not at all.	1																					
20	20		401							2	1511																							
21	21		301									Wanshi loads his rifle again. He walks against the wall toward the top of the building as he talks to you, and there is not a sense of fatigue in his voice.																						
22	22		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Wanshi	It has been a long... long time since I last worked overtime.	1

26	26		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						A breeze blows past Wanshi, mixing with the chilliness of the distant waves. The impurities in the air narrow his field of view, focusing and magnifying the details he would normally ignore.																						
27	27		301									The burning golden dust floats in the air, the sparkling light flickering in Wanshi's eyes like a pearlescent fish scale—his whole body is working, yet even his eyelashes are still. A perfect and precise creation.																						
28	28		301									His rifle seems to be the key that unlocks Wanshi. He becomes so different with it. One cannot help but imagine what he would be like when holding a scalpel.																						
29	29		201							1	500273	4

33	33		301									"Bang!" He opens fire, and the sound of birdsong mingled with their flapping wings reaches your ears.																						
34	34		301									The bullet seems to have pierced through the white and green target at the Babylonia shooting range, breaking the boundary between the man and monster, before hitting a mechanical brain, creating ripples in the air.																						
35	35		201							1	500273	4

38	38		301								Wanshi	... 37. All clear.	1																					
39	39		202							1					1																			
40	40		301									The last of the Corrupted on the rooftop falls in the sound of its shriek and his tactical pistol. All is quiet.																						
41	41		301									You glance at the terminal, and the last flickering signal of the Corrupted within the safe area is also gone.																						
42	42		302								Phew.	43																						
43	43		301									You instantly feel a sense of relief. The once ordinary task feels no less mundane now because of Wanshi's presence.																						
44	44		301									The afternoon breeze blows gently your way with the scent of battles, scattering the foul smoke and the chaotic sounds around you.																						
45	45		201							1	500273																							
46	46		301							1	Wanshi	Stay still. Your arm needs to be treated.	1																					
47	47		301									Your arm was cut by a broken steel bar during the fight. It is getting a little exhausting to keep getting hurt in the arm.																						
48	48		301									Wanshi gently holds your arm while you lean back to let him work. He has the magic around him—maybe all doctors do—that makes you feel relaxed you are with him, that you are willing to show him your wounds.																						
49	49		301									Wanshi goes into a completely different state while treating you. It is a similar kind of focus to when he holds his rifle, but with a slight difference.																						
50	50		301									You can almost glimpse into his past, deep as the ocean, through his calm expression and steady motions.																						
51	51		201							1	500273																							
52	52		301							1	Wanshi	522.	1																					
53	53		302								What?	54	More Corrupted?	54																				
54	54		301								Wanshi	Not the number of kills I've had. It's... the number of lives I've saved.	1																					
55	55		302								That's a lot more than I expected.	56																						
56	56		301								Wanshi	It used to be the surgeries. And then it became the scout missions. Right now, it is you.	1																					
57	57		302								I'm not dying that easily.	58																						
58	58		301								Wanshi	Emotions taking over my commonsense, I guess.	1																					
59	59		301								Wanshi	No matter how many times I've practiced... I still can't get rid of the distractions from my emotions.	1																					
60	60		302								I get it.	61	It's not uncommon.	61																				
61	61		301								Wanshi	That's true...	1																					
62	62		301									Wanshi puts the medical devices back before immediately lying down sideways, closing his eyes. Words in his mouth turn into murmurs as if he is dreaming.																						
63	63		204							1	8																							
64	64		301								Wanshi	But this time, it's not quite... the same...	1																					
65	65		302								Sleepy again?	66	Stop falling asleep on the battlefield!	66																				
66	66		204							1	8																							
67	67		301								Wanshi	The Corrupted in the quarantine zone, all cleared...	1																					
68	68		301								Wanshi	Reinforcement arriving in twelve minutes...	1																					
69	69		302								Wanshi, you're a good doctor.	70																						
70	70		301								Wanshi	...I'm not interested in fighting for humanity's fate.	1																					
71	71		302								...Right.	72																						
72	72		301								Wanshi	I just... want to heal those who matter to me.	1																					
73	73		302								...I see.	74																						
74	74		202							1					1																			
75	75		301									————																						
76	76		301									It seems like he has not heard your last line at all, as Wanshi's frame has fully entered rest mode.																						
77	77		201							1	500273	8																						
78	78		301							1	Wanshi	...	1																					
79	79		202							1					1																			
80	80		301									He is sleeping indeed. There is no response even when you pat him on the face with your numb hand.																						
81	81		301									You watch his eyelids gradually closing, and despite your bewilderment at how he can doze off here and now, you feel a little bit of tenderness. You cannot help but lean against the rugged wall and slowly relax.																						
82	82		301									Perhaps it is because of the anesthetic, or maybe the words of Wanshi were too convincing. Drowsiness soon sweeps over you alongside a sense of relief...	...It feels somewhat familiar.																					
83	83		302								But... this is the first time that Wanshi...	84																						
84	84		302								...is deep asleep before me...	85

90	90		301			DialogEnable						Everything is gray in your vision. Then the light slowly draws the silhouettes before you.																						
91	91		301									You vaguely recognize that it is your dorm. When you turn your head, you can see the bed next to you is piled with colorful gifts and fruit baskets.																						
92	92		201							1	1081001	1																						
93	93		301							1	Kamui	C-Capt! The commandant is awake!	1																					
94	94		301									An earsplitting scream follows immediately, and a face gets so close to you that it is all you can see.																						
95	95		302								Hi, Kamui.	96	Where's Wanshi?	99																				
96	96		204							1	2																							
97	97		301								Kamui	Thank goodness!	1

99	99		301								Kamui	I'm sorry, but unfortunately, Wanshi passed away during the mission earlier...	1

101	101		202							1					1																			
102	102		301									Suddenly, a hand reaches out from the pile of gifts and throws an apple at Kamui.

104	104		301							1	Wanshi	Stop talking nonsense.	1

107	107		301									Kamui jumps up and catches the apple with a nimble move before taking a bite like it is the most natural thing.																						
108	108		302								Why are you all in my room?	109																						
109	109		301								Kamui	When Lucia and the others found you, you two were sleeping together! (Chews)	1																					
110	110		302								...	111																						
111	111		301								Kamui	So thanks to Wanshi, the Captain and I can also come to visit you, Commandant.	1																					
112	112		301								Kamui	But it's great to see that Wanshi is also getting along with the others!	1																					
113	113		302								Speaking of which, why is Wanshi in my bed?	114																						
114	114		301								Kamui	Wanshi said your bed is more comfortable. Let me give it a try as well!	1

120	120		301								Chrome	...I'm sorry, Commandant. That's not how Wanshi is usually like.	2																					
121	121		302								It's alright.	122	Bring it on!	128	Let me join the jenga!	133
