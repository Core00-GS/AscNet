29	28		301							1	Celica	Yes, President.	2																					
30	29		301								Celica	Gray Raven, you were able to remove the Punishing Heteromer at the space station last time, but sadly, it was not completely destroyed.	2																					
31	30		301								Celica	I'm sure you have all noticed... It collided with Watanabe's Fenrir and... plummeted down onto Earth.	2

38	37		202							1					1																			
39	38		301								Hassen	Back to the main topic today, Gray Raven, your mission this time is to return to Earth and destroy the Hetero-Core from last time.	2																					
40	39		301								Hassen	I've also deployed other teams on this mission, and this here, is the area that Gray Raven is responsible for.	2

42	41		301							1	Lee	Akdilek Commercial Alliance... Wait, this diagram, is a train?	3

45	44		301								Hassen	The ACA is a special faction that built their empire on the train. They combined Cosmos Industries' Central Purification Filter technology with a train and transformed it into a mobile Akdilek purification system.	2																					
46	45		301								Hassen	Using heavy nuclear fusion reactor as its energy source, as long as the train keeps moving—	2																					
47	46		301								Hassen	The filtration system will block out the Punishing Virus. That's how they can live on that train.	2

50	49		301							1	Liv	But are there still intact railways for the train to operate on? And the resource supplies...	1																					
51	50		202							1					1																			
52	51		301								Hassen	They already built a massive railway network on the flat Eurasia lands back in the Golden Age—the APUS.	2																					
53	52		301								Hassen	As for resources, they're merchants, they have their ways.	2																					
54	53		201							3	1011001		400																					
55	54		301							1	Lee	So to put it simply, they trade with forces all over the world by rail to ensure their survival. That's how the ACA operates, am I mistaken?	3																					
56	55		202							3					1																			
57	56		301								Hassen	You're correct. And the main objective of your mission is to find and destroy the Hetero-Core that is currently on the train.	2																					
58	57		301								Hassen	According to the Science Council's detailed analysis, I'm afraid the Hetero-Core is not just simply the multi-form Punishing Heteromer you saw at the space station.	2																					
59	58		301								Hassen	I've already made a copy of the detailed report... Anyway, the Hetero-Core is a very pesky thing.	2

61	60		301								Hassen	Even though the ACA still hasn't sent out an official distress signal, we can't just sit here and do nothing.	2																					
62	61		301								Hassen	Commandant of Gray Raven, can I entrust this mission to you?	2																					
63	62		302								Just leave it to me!	63	I'm not 100% sure, but...	64																				
64	63	66	301								Hassen	Then I'll wait for your good news here.	2																					
65	64		301								Hassen	Haha, I didn't know the commandant of Gray Raven could say something like that.	2																					
66	65		301								Hassen	That doesn't sound like what an experienced commandant, someone who gets out of trouble alive every time like yourself, would say. But being careful is never a bad thing.	2																					
67	66		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Hassen	Well then, Gray Raven, please proceed to the designated location by aircraft after maintenance. Chop chop, everyone! Let the mission begin!	2
