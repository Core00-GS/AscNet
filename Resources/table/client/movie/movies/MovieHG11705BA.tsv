3	3		301									You open your eyes and... find yourself in a completely different place.																						
4	4		301									The place looks to be a landfill. The stench of gasoline and rotten food fills the air.																						
5	5		301									Under the glimmering light, you manage to make out piles of scrap in front. You approach them and realize that they are all... Construct remains.																						
6	6		302								...	7	...Let's look for Luna first.	7																				
7	7		301									You hear something on the other side of the landfill. You decide to go over and check.																						
8	999		401							2	1516																							
9	8		301									You see Luna standing in a pile of Corrupted remains, staring at another girl.																						
10	9		302								Luna looks... younger than usual.	10																						
11	10		201							1	500255	14																						
12	11		301							1	Luna	Sister...	1																					
13	12		301									Luna whimpers.																						
14	13		302								I must be nearing the bottom of her M.I.N.D.	14	I'm going back in time for her memories...	14																				
15	14		201							1	500256	3																						
16	15		301							1	???	Enough! You're just another filthy Corrupted!	1																					
17	16		301									The girl before Luna, also a Construct, shouts vehemently.																						
18	17		401							1	202																							
19	18		201							1	500255	14																						
20	19		301							1	Luna	Sister, you had me kill those Corrupted, and I did it—they're all dead... Why are you looking at me like this?	1																					
21	20		301									Luna trembles, trying to hold the hand of the girl.																						
22	21		302								What's this...?	22	Did this happen in Luna's youth?	22																				
23	22		301									You must be going back in time in her M.I.N.D. space. The deepest scars are always buried in the deepest recesses of one's M.I.N.D., to which you must be drawing near.																						
24	23		201							1	500256	5																						
25	24		301							1	???	Get lost! I only found some ugly plushie, and you kept clinging to me like I'm your sister—I don't have a Corrupted sister like you!	1																					
26	25		301								???	Die! Corrupted, die! I'm going to Babylonia, and you filth should just rot here!	1

29	28		301									The girl points her handgun at Luna and is about to pull the trigger...	1																					
30	29		301									But Luna simply stands there, with a face drowned in sadness.	1																					
31	30		302								Watch out!	998

33	997		204							1																								
34	31		301									You push Luna out of the way immediately. She drops her knife—one she has unknowingly wielded—and stumbles for a few steps. She finally comes to, and her expression returns to normal.	1																					
35	32		201							1	500255	5																						
36	33		301							1	Luna	You're standing in my way?	1																					
37	34		302								You were about to be shot.	35																						
38	35		301									The female Construct glares at you with a dreadful look on her face.																						
39	36		201							1	500256	5																						
40	37		301								???	That's a Corrupted! She's evil! Get outta my way and let me kill her!	1																					
41	38		302								Stay away from her.	39																						
42	39		301								???	If I kill her, I can go to Babylonia!	1																					
43	40		302								That's not how it works!	41																						
44	41		204							1																								
45	42		301								???	Shut up! It is! Try stop me if you can! Kill me if you dare! Come kill me, huh?! Kill me!	1																					
46	43		302								Go away!	44																						
47	44		202							1					1																			
48	45		301									The female Construct is practically begging for Luna to kill her. For some reason... a voice in your heart tells you that this is a crossroad in Luna's life where there is no turning back.																						
49	996		201							1	500255					1																		
50	46		301									Luna woodenly picks up the knife, now dirtied by the ground, and approaches the Construct.		1																				
51	47		302								(Stop Luna)	48	Don't do this, Luna.	48																				
52	48		201							1	500255	14																						
53	49		301							1	Luna	Kill... Kill... Sister... N-no...	1																					
54	50		201							1	500256																							
55	51		301							1	???	Come! Kill me! And you'll be an Ascendant! You can do whatever you want!	1																					
56	52		302								Enough!	995																						
57	995		502							PanelActor1Shake																								
58	53		301									You pick the Construct up by her collar. You find yourself consumed with rage.	1																					
59	54		302								Enough is enough!	55	If you wanna die, I don't mind helping you out!	55																				
60	55		204							1	5																							
61	56		301							1	???	Damn it... Damn you all! Disgusting, wretched Corrupted!	1																					
62	57		202							1					1																			
63	58		301									The Construct stomps and struggles, but she eventually leaves resentfully.																						
64	59		401							1	211																							
65	60		302								Are you okay?	61																						
66	61		201							1	500255	5																						
67	62		301							1	Luna	What is wrong with you...? Why are you stopping me?!	1																					
68	63		301									Luna has a ghastly expression on her face, but she seems more in control right now.																						
69	64		301								Luna	Get out.	1																					
70	65		302								...	66																						
71	66		301								Luna	Get out of my dream!	1																					
72	67		302								...If I could, I would.	68																						
73	68		301									Luna lowers her head and stares at her hands. They are smeared with blackish mud.																						
74	69		301									...You cannot tell what must have truly happened in this memory fragment.																						
75	70		301								Luna	What made you think you could do that?	1																					
76	71		302								I'm just doing what I think is right.	72	You don't need to do the same thing twice.	72																				
77	72		301								Luna	Insolent...!	1																					
78	73		301									Luna bites her lips, seemingly trembling from head to toe. She then wipes her hands on the fabric before her chest, trying to clean them.																						
79	74		302								...	75																						
80	75		301									You hand her a handkerchief of yours.																						
81	76		302								I have an idea of how to wake up.	77																						
82	77		301								Luna	...	1																					
83	78		302								People build safe zones in their minds.	79																						
84	79		302								If we reach that place...	80																						
85	80		302								We might be able to leave.	81																						
86	81		301								Luna	Safe zone...	1																					
87	82		301								Luna	I...	1																					
88	83		203							1	0.5		-1000																					
89	84		301									As if running out of energy, Luna collapses.
