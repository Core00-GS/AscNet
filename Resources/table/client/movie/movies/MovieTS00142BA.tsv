15	15		301								Roland	I can't fight a Construct like her... with the power from the Punishing Virus...	1																					
16	16		301								Nanami	Roland the Ascendant, you better come with Nanami!	2

21	21		301								Roland	(Chuckles) You do pick the right time to show up...	1																					
22	22		301								Roland	I've no strength left to deal with you... however...	1																					
23	23		301								Roland	If you want to catch me... you'll have to go through Nat's guards first...	1																					
24	24		301								Nanami	Nanami's afraid of no guards! So stay there and behave, alright? Do—not—move!	2

28	28		301								Roland	But maybe it'll lessen the effect of the golden antigen on me.	1																					
29	29		301								Roland	Who could have thought that an Ascendant like me... would need to use the power of an ordinary frame...	1																					
30	30		301								Roland	...	1																					
31	31		301								Roland	(Looks up to find Nanami standing in front of him already) What... are you doing? The guards are behind you!	1

34	34		301								Nanami	(Uses Roland's body to block the vent on the ground) Ta-da! There won't have more of this sand coming through the vent now!	2																					
35	35		301								Roland	...A bit primitive, but I can't believe it works!	1																					
36	36		301								Roland	Nanami, can you locate more vents like this?! I can't see through all the antigens...	1
