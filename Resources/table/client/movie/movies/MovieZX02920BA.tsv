7	7		301								Bella	Really?!	1																					
8	8		301								Conservation Area Staff 1	It must be four years ago. It was raining, and she was holding an injured child, trying to convince the staff in the conservation area to take her kid. It's hard to forget something like that.	2																					
9	9		301								Bella	A child...?	1																					
10	10		301								Conservation Area Staff 1	Yeah, a three-year-old boy she said she saved on her way. Unfortunately, the kid had a fever and passed away that night.	2																					
11	11		301								Bella	Do you know what her name is and where she is now?	1																					
12	12		301								Conservation Area Staff 1	Her name... I can try the old records. I seem to recall her putting her name down as the kid's sole guardian.	2																					
13	13		301								Conservation Area Staff 1	Ah, here we go. Elena Bella. It was the September four years ago. She was a member of Bumblebee.	2

39	39		301									Bella asks what Noan cannot ask.																						
40	40		301								Cargo Crew Member 1	Because Jamilah is calling the shot now, and Niino didn't really have anything to do with the mole. He was protecting the people in the back carriages at the end, so Ashlar hasn't managed to get anything on him.	2

54	54		301								Cargo Crew Member 3	Sigh. Either way, his barbaric deeds were gradually exposed, and anyone with half a brain knew to stay away from him. The only ones still under his control are the ones he has leverage on.	2																					
55	55		301								Cargo Crew Member 3	The bastard doesn't care who he hurts anymore. He went after the Maintenance Crew not too long ago! The ******* Maintenance Crew! Only a girl named Sophia survived and became a Construct.	2

93	93		301								Cargo Crew Captain	I still dream about that day, even now! There's no forgetting it!	1																					
94	94		301								Cargo Crew Captain	You lot loves to complain about Ashlar and his antiroyalists nowadays, but guess what? They were so much worse back then! Their guards would murder people in broad daylight!	1																					
95	95		301								Cargo Crew Captain	Do you know why Babylonia refused to work with Ashlar? Do you know how his dirty deeds got exposed?	1																					
96	96		301								Cargo Crew Captain	It was the evidence a core member presented that tore down his empire bit by bit! That terminal might have been broken back then, delaying the trial for a few years...	1																					
97	97		301								Cargo Crew Captain	But the bill comes due. It didn't get better over time naturally—people had to pave that road with their corpses!	1
