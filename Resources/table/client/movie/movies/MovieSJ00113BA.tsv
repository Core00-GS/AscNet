5	5		301									Amberia raised her hands as if wanting to grasp at something, then she gradually began to disintegrate at the fingertips.																						
6	6		301									The blasphemous black fog enveloping her dispersed, and she looked as if she was praying.

11	11		301								"Amberia"	...I won't have to fear the endless cold. Don't need to worry about someone stealing your bed sheets.	1																					
12	12		301								"Amberia"	Somewhere far from here, there is a place that is green all year round—not the grayish-green of an evergreen forest, but like that of luscious jade...	1																					
13	13		301								"Amberia"	There... I'll tell the child fairy tales and adventure stories. I'll take her traveling with me.	1																					
14	14		301								"Amberia"	We'll sail across the sea. From the pole to pole...	1

50	46		301							1	Staessen	All the bionics have stopped sending the abnormal signal, so they won't be a threat for the time being. Seems like everything has returned to normal.	1																					
51	47		302								I hope so.	48	What about the remaining bionics?	50

69	63		301								???	No human heard our words.																						
70	64		301								???	We sympathize with her anger, her despair and her hatred. In a few rare cases, we can see the dreams of her less frightening nature.																						
71	65		301								???	We see the "Real Amberia". We see her small glimmer of hope.																						
72	66		301								???	Some comrades don't understand our lofty ideals, instead they left us for a peculiar Construct. Those that remain agree to my methods.																						
73	67		301								???	We want to find when she is awake, where she is free to run and smile to her heart's content. We can take her away from the polar region and go traveling elsewhere.																						
74	68		301								???	But I don't know which link is malfunctioning. Our creation can't laugh or tell the fairy tales. She has only mechanical hatred in her heart, and seeks nothing but destruction and revenge.																						
75	69		301								???	Perhaps... This was doomed to fail from the start.																						
76	70		301								???	We created "her" worst nightmare.																						
77	71		301								???	That's not Amberia. It was just an empty shell of a monster.																						
78	72		301								???	Maybe it's time... to accept that she is gone.																						
79	73		301								???	In the end, she gave us the "freedom" she couldn't get.																						
80	74		301								???	At the moment, she truly did say "thank you".																						
81	75		301								???	Perhaps, that is enough.
