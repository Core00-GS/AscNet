10	10		301							1	Roland	What are you expecting them to grow into, exactly? Tigers that hunt, or sheep that follow?	2																					
11	11		301								Vonnegut	The Red Tide is inevitable. Should we let it grow unrestrained, it'll only bring chaos, disorder, and consequences uncontrollable.	1																					
12	12		301								Vonnegut	As I have mentioned many times, we need friends in the brave new world. I have no preference for whether they are predators or prey.	1																					
13	13		301								Vonnegut	After all, it is all a lesson to learn—a reflection of "humanity."	1																					
14	14		301								Roland	If that's the case, why did you tell Cinderelik the story about the demon who "saw that humans were weak and greedy, and decided to reshape the world"?	2																					
15	15		301								Vonnegut	I also said to let her "witness humanity's potential."	1																					
16	16		301								Vonnegut	What would happen if the demon woke up to something other than greedy adventurers?	1																					
17	17		301								Vonnegut	Where there is shadow, there is light. I don't dismiss the existence of light just because of the many shadows in the world.	1																					
18	18		301								Vonnegut	If all the twins see is how despicable humanity is, then humankind shall die to its own reflection. Should there be speckles of light, however, the twins shall react in kind.	1

20	20		301								Roland	Does that mean you still believe in some of the humans?	2																					
21	21		301								Vonnegut	All I "believe in" are the Constructs. Even if some of the humans' consciousnesses were fit to ascend, their bodies wouldn't survive the filtering of the Punishing Virus.	1																					
22	22		301								Vonnegut	Even if I were to feel pity, I could not make their choices for them.	1																					
23	23		204							2	2																							
24	24		301								Roland	Ha. I suppose "luck" is part of the filtering process, isn't it? After all, only the lucky ones get to become Constructs when they want to. The unlucky ones can only wither in their misfortune.	2																					
25	25		301								Vonnegut	Having said that, nothing's stopping us from trying something new.	1
