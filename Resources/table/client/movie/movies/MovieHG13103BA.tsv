5	5		301									With her hand placed on the window frame, she seems like a statue forgotten by the world.																						
6	6		301									It's only when your movement breaks the silence in the air that she finally turns this way to face you.

16	16		301									Pure white, the land reaches well into the distance until it touches the horizon at the very far end.

21	21		301							1	Bianca	It's all sunny out there. Seems like we've only been delayed for a bit.	1																					
22	22		301								Bianca	I made you some breakfast with the portal kitchenware and frozen ingredients, Commandant, but I'm afraid you'll have to eat it in the vehicle.	1																					
23	23		302								The what?	24																						
24	24		202							1					1																			
25	25		301									You look out the window—and see that the polar vehicle that was stuck in the snow is now parked right outside the research station.																						
26	26		201							1	500535																							
27	27		301							1	Bianca	I brought it back while you were still sleeping.	1																					
28	28		301								Bianca	It took me a few hours, and it isn't anything overly challenging for a Construct.	1																					
29	29		301									And you finally see them—the snowflakes on Bianca's hair, presumably from when she was trying to get the vehicle out of the hole.

39	39		204							1	3																							
40	40		301								Bianca	Except I just couldn't bring myself to do it seeing you sound asleep.	1																					
41	41		204							1																								
42	42		301								Bianca	And considering what we'll be doing next, you were supposed to have as much rest as possible to recover from everything we did last night.	1																					
43	43		301								Bianca	Constructs are much better suited for occasions like this, Commandant. You should avoid exerting yourself until you're absolutely needed.	1																					
44	44		204							1	1																							
45	45		301								Bianca	We're a team now, remember?	1																					
46	46		302								...Of course.	47

51	51		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The tent is put away and the polar vehicle is started.																						
52	52		301									Holding the cup of creamy soup that Bianca made for you, you turn your gaze at the pure white expanse that's this land.																						
53	53		301									With the snowstorm lifted, you can now finally appreciate the views this land has to offer.																						
54	54		301									Unlike the Arctic Circle—currently occupied by the ARU—this place is humanless in every sense of the word.																						
55	55		301									No humans, no conflicts, no viruses, and no war.																						
56	56		301									Quiet and untarnished. You never thought that Earth—now a planet ruined and torn apart by the war between humanity and the Punishing Virus—still had a place like this.																						
57	57		301									The white expanse just goes on and on and on.																						
58	58		201							1	500533	1																						
59	59		301							1	Bianca	I have some coffee here, Commandant. It's instant, though.	1																					
60	60		301									Holding a vacuum flask, Bianca looks at you out of the corner of her eye with a smile on her face.																						
61	61		302								Thanks.	62																						
62	62		202							1					1																			
63	63		301									Receiving the vacuum flask and opening the lid, you smell the wonderful aroma of coffee right away.																						
64	64		301									Then, a curious thought crosses your mind.																						
65	65		301									You aren't sure if it's some trick the white expanse is doing to your mind, but...																						
66	66		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					For a split second, you thought this odyssey through the snow would last forever.

71	71		301									With Bianca's friendly reminder, you snap back from your daydream.																						
72	72		302								(Nod)	73																						
73	73		202							1					1																			
74	74		301									Finishing the rest of the creamy soup from the cup, you try to calm yourself down and rid yourself of any unnecessary emotions.																						
75	75		301									You were momentarily lost in the view, but you never forgot what you came here to do.																						
76	76		301									Seeing the research station in the distance where the expedition was stationed, you ask Bianca to park the vehicle in the shade behind a snow-covered rock.																						
77	77		302								Let's go on foot from here.	78																						
78	78		201							1	500533																							
79	79		301							1	Bianca	Roger that.	1																					
80	80		202							1																								
81	81		301									Getting out of the vehicle, Bianca pulls out the Swordstaff from under the driver's seat.																						
82	82		302								(Load gun.)	83																						
83	83		401							2	1511																							
84	84		301									Without a word, you and Bianca communicate and agree on a strategy with eyes and gestures only. Then, following Bianca, you close in on the research station.																						
85	85		301									This research station looks about the same as the one you spent the night in last night, but you can tell from the light and running exhaust fans that this place is still in operation.																						
86	86		301									You and Bianca make it all the way to the entrance without being ambushed.																						
87	87		301									From right outside the entrance, however, you can hear a conversation coming from the inside.																						
88	88		401							1	203																							
89	89		301								(Someone's voice.)	Now, I just need to start a "revolution" here...

103	103		301							1	Bianca	Drop all your weapons now!	1																					
104	104		301									With years of experience under her belt as a member of the Purifying Force, Bianca decided to hold down the people in this research station by force, having determined how many of them there were from the conversation.																						
105	105		401							1	205																							
106	106		201							1	500019																							
107	107		301							1	Expedition Member A	And all the points will just... Holy sweet mother of God! What in God's name is going on?!	1

109	109		201							3	500405		-600																					
110	110		301							1		Looking this way, the people inside all seem caught off guard.																						
111	111		301									With the door blown off, a gust of wind blows in and sweeps up the pile of cards on the table.																						
112	112		301									With four spade sevens in hand, the expedition member who just shouted looks utterly baffled seeing you and Bianca.																						
113	113		301									The way they look, however, doesn't seem to fit how they're described in the mission report—"showed signs of 'defecting' or 'missing'."																						
114	114		202							1	2	3			1																			
115	115		201							1	500533	7																						
116	116		301							1	Bianca	What... is going on?	1																					
117	117		301									At this point, Bianca looks as utterly baffled as all the expedition members looking at her in the eye, causing you to feel even more tense than you were just moments ago.																						
118	118		201							1	500405																							
119	119		301							1	Expedition Member B	A-are you from Babylonia?	1																					
120	120		201							1	500533	5			-80																			
121	121		301							1	Bianca	We're the Purifying Force, and we're here to...	1																					
122	122		301								Bianca	...	1																					
123	123		301									The situation is now beyond awkward, and Bianca isn't sure how to handle these scared people who don't carry any weapons.																						
124	124		203							1	0.25																							
125	125		301									Taking a step back, she seems to want you to take over.																						
126	126		204							1	8																							
127	127		301								Bianca	I think it's best that you take over from here, Commandant.	1																					
128	128		204							1																								
129	129		301									They all draw a deep breath at the mention of the Purifying Force—they might have been huddled up in here for years now, but they know exactly what the Purifying Force does.																						
130	130		301									You exchange a look with Bianca and nod at her.																						
131	131		401							1	36																							
132	132		302								(You bring all of them up to speed.)	133

136	136		201							2	500405		400																					
137	137		301							1	Expedition Member A	Did you just say they thought we'd defected? What a bunch of nonsense!	1																					
138	138		301								Expedition Member B	We've been stationed here for years already. And can you even imagine how a bunch of research Constructs like us are capable of defection?	2																					
139	139		202							2					1																			
140	140		201							1	500533																							
141	141		301							1	Bianca	But Babylonia did get a very strange communication...	1																					
142	142		201							1	500019		-400																					
143	143		201							2	500405		400			1																		
144	144		301							1	Expedition Member A	A communication...? Wait...	1																					
145	145		301								Expedition Member B	Do you guys think they're talking about... that...?	2																					
146	146		301									The expedition members exchange looks amongst themselves as they speak in hushed voices.																						
147	147		202							1	2				1																			
148	148		201							1	500028																							
149	149		301							1		Finally, a captain-present Construct steps out and, in a sincere tone, starts speaking to you.																						
150	150		301								Expedition Captain	Apologies, Commandant, but it seems like there was some misunderstanding between us and Babylonia.	1																					
151	151		301								Expedition Captain	And we may have an idea of what might have caused the misunderstanding.	1																					
152	152		301								Expedition Captain	It'd be a bit of a hassle to explain it, and I think having you see it for yourselves would save all of us the hassle.	1																					
153	153		301								Expedition Captain	Would you both like to go with us, then? We'll fill you in on everything once we're there.	1																					
154	154		201							1	500533																							
155	155		301							1	Bianca	What should we do, Commandant?	1																					
156	156		301									This is supposed to be the Purifying Force's mission, but Bianca is putting you in charge of the situation here. It's your call now whether or not you want to trust these people.																						
157	157		202							1					1																			
158	158		302								...Well, much obliged, then.	159																						
159	159		301									Seeing their reactions and attitudes, you don't think you'd ever describe these people as "defectors"?																						
160	160		301									Besides, these Constructs are all of an earlier version and all came without weapons. Granted that the group was twice its current size, Bianca still would have been able to dust them all up in a breeze with her latest specialized frame.																						
161	161		301									Which is why you think it wouldn't hurt to trust them.																						
162	162		201							1	500028																							
163	163		301							1	Expedition Captain	Of course.	1																					
164	164		202							1																								
165	165		301									Taking care of the door blown off by Bianca, the Captain asks the rest of the expedition to gear up to leave.

167	167		101			RImgBg2Enable				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory221.png																								
168	168		301									Following the expedition, you arrive at the research station's garage—which houses an exploration vehicle big enough to carry everyone.																						
169	169		301									This time, however, you're the one behind the wheel, while the Captain, who sits in the front passenger seat, sets the destination for you. You've decided to take this as a safety measure against the expedition—so that if and when anything does happen, at least you're in control of the wheel.																						
170	170		301									Sitting in the middle row are two expedition members. Bianca has taken the very last row, where she'd be able to keep an eye on the expedition.																						
171	171		401							2	885

173	173		101			RImgBg2Enable				Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory216.png																								
174	174		301									With the exploration vehicle now heading away from the research station, you find the air inside quieter and heavier still than when you were traveling with just Bianca.																						
175	175		301									These people seem edgy about your sudden appearance. To them, Bianca probably seems like someone who wouldn't hesitate for a second to slash them the moment she thinks they're trying anything funny.																						
176	176		301									Judging a book by its cover can be detrimental, and you certainly don't want that to get in the way between you and these people—which is why you've decided to take the initiative to strike up a conversation to clear the air.																						
177	177		302								Have you all always been here since Babylonia was established?	178																						
178	178		201							1	500028																							
179	179		301							1	Expedition Captain	Well... to be more precise, we've been here since WGAA's Archaeological Team was formed.	1																					
180	180		301								Expedition Captain	What we do doesn't really have to do with WGAA's objectives, though, despite the fact that we fall under their jurisdiction.	1																					
181	181		301								Expedition Captain	There are no human civilizations here, so we are mainly just trying to investigate Earth's ecological changes and previously unknown species...	1																					
182	182		301								Expedition Captain	An example would be... how we're able to come up with better estimates of Earth's overall climatic changes based on the data we've collected from our long-term observation of Antarctica's climate... See, global warming has been a source of headache for humans since as early as the Golden Age.	1																					
183	183		301								Expedition Captain	Another example would be... Say, if we have a better understanding of the food chain here, we just might be able to come up with a sustainable resource acquisition system that would go a long way to benefit not just Babylonia... but humanity as a whole.	1																					
184	184		301								Expedition Captain	These are all very important on many different levels, and yet... Babylonia focuses almost entirely on trying to get humanity's lost lands on Earth, to the point that they decided to put this expedition under WGAA and not the Science Council.	1																					
185	185		202							1					1

187	187		201							2	500405		400			1																		
188	188		301							1	Expedition Member A	We understand that our work isn't substantially helpful in terms of fighting off the Punishing Virus, which is why we've learned to play within our limits.	1																					
189	189		301								Expedition Member B	We rarely ever ask to have precision gadgets sent our way, and it's been God-only-knows-how-long since a good number of us last had our maintenance done back in Babylonia.	2																					
190	190		202							2					1																			
191	191		201							1	500028																							
192	192		301							1	Expedition Captain	We're basically just a whole bunch of free-range chicks... See, sometimes I wonder if Babylonia still remembers us. Haha...	1																					
193	193		201							1	500533																							
194	194		301							1	Bianca	I can tell you that Babylonia still remembers all of you here.	1																					
195	195		301								Bianca	This much I can say with certainty.	1																					
196	196		301									Bianca cuts the Captain's self-mockery short.																						
197	197		301								Bianca	The command center sent both of us here to look into the matter right after receiving your message.	1																					
198	198		301								Bianca	The higher-ups did take the possibility of defection into account, but we weren't sent here to purge anyone without first figuring out what happened. Commandant and I would have helped the expedition however we could, had it turned out that you were caught in the middle of an accident.	1																					
199	199		302								We'll never leave our people to die.	200																						
200	200		201							1	500028																							
201	201		301							1	Expedition Captain	Uhm... is that so?	1																					
202	202		301								Expedition Captain	I don't know if you're just being polite, but those words sure sound reassuring.	1																					
203	203		201							1	500019																							
204	204		301							1	Expedition Member A	Say... you wouldn't happen to be the Gray Raven Commandant, would you?	1																					
205	205		302								Do you know me?	206																						
206	206		201							1	500405																							
207	207		301							1	Expedition Member B	Haha... we recognized you the moment you came in.	1																					
208	208		301								Expedition Member B	Babylonia sends us a battle report on the frontline for our monthly communication... and that's pretty much our only means of staying in touch with the ground.	1																					
209	209		301								Expedition Member B	Your name and pictures are always everywhere on the reports.	1																					
210	210		201							1	500019																							
211	211		301							1	Expedition Member A	As far away as we might be from the Punishing Virus, we still pay a whole lot of attention to humanity's fight against the Punishing Virus.	1																					
212	212		301								Expedition Member A	We all know by heart every single thing that the Task Force has done... Mind you, though, we do spend a lot of time debating if they actually happened...	1																					
213	213		301								Expedition Member A	But I'm damned. Never thought I'd ever get a chance to meet the legend of this generation from Babylonia...	1																					
214	214		302								This whole legend thing is totally blown out of proportion, though...	215	I couldn't have done what I have if I were on my own.	215																				
215	215		301									They all get worked up seeing you admit your identity.																						
216	216		201							1	500405																							
217	217		301							1	Expedition Member B	And I heard you were part of the Battle of Kowloong, no? How many of you were there? And there wasn't just Babylonia, right? Heard almost all the major forces from the ground were there, no?	1																					
218	218		301								Expedition Member B	And the battle at Pulia Forest Park. Heard it was very bad...	1																					
219	219		201							1	500019																							
220	220		301							1	Expedition Member A	Is our latest specialized frame really able to absorb the Punishing Virus? And the Construct going by the name Karenina that took care of the whole incident with the zero-point engine on the Moon... Where did she even come from?	1																					
221	221		301									These people have been out of touch with the world for way too long, so it only makes sense that they would want to find out if all the battles they've heard about are real.																						
222	222		202							1					1																			
223	223		301									Time passes by as the chitchat goes on, and you've arrived at your destination before you know it.																						
224	224		302								What's that...	225																						
225	225		301									With not a single road sign or landmark in sight, you have no idea just how far this place is from the research station you came from.
