16	16		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						At the same time, there is a gray figure roaming the wasteland.																						
17	17		301									The wasteland has always been an unfriendly place to lonesome travelers, especially after the Punishing Virus outbreak. The Corrupted who linger here makes this place even more dangerous.																						
18	18		301									The gray figure continues walking the wasteland, and the Corrupted pause and hesitate, their instincts resisting the Punishing Virus's desire for destruction.																						
19	19		301									The traveler is neither human nor beast, neither a Construct of Babylonia, nor a Corrupted like them.																						
20	20		301									She is a higher being.																						
21	21		301									The gray figure keeps walking on, and this pitch-black world stares at her silently in awe as it makes way for her.																						
22	22		301									On this road, lies the disfigured remnants of a body.																						
23	23		301								???	...																						
24	24		301									The traveler goes up to it and cups the broken face in the palm of her hands.																						
25	25		301									She sees a wound across the mechanical body, and another. The upper and lower part of the body are barely held together by the broken spine.																						
26	26		301									She sees that its mangled right hand is still tightly gripping a pair of weapons that could be scythes or guns.																						
27	27		301									This body seems to have gone through hell, holding on to its final obsession and perseverance, and falls on the path forward—at least, that is what the traveler thinks.																						
28	28		301									What did the path ahead hold for him?																						
29	29		301									The traveler has asked many people that question, and has received different answers.																						
30	30		301									The traveler fully accepts their dreams, obsessions, hopes and despair.																						
31	31		301								???	Is there something you wanted to do?																						
32	32		301									...																						
33	33		301									...																						
34	34		301									...																						
35	35		301								???	...I see.																						
36	36		301									No one knows what words the traveler hears from the body, or perhaps the traveler does not expect an answer from it.
