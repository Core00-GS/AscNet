15	16		301								Jamilah	What's up? Your target is standing right here. Aren't you going to say something?	2																					
16	17		301								Sophia	...I don't talk to corpses.	1																					
17	18		301								Jamilah	You have at least four electronic shackles on you. Are you sure I'm going to die today?	2																					
18	19		301								Sophia	...	1

32	33		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The next instant, she pulls out a pistol from the hidden holster in her frame and points it at Jamilah.																						
33	34		301								Sophia	Why?																						
34	35		301								Jamilah	...I knew you were inexperienced.																						
35	36		301								Sophia	I'm asking you, why.																						
36	37		301								Jamilah	You just gave up the best chance to shoot at me for an answer.																						
37	38		301								Sophia	I'm not asking a third time.																						
38	39		301								Jamilah	...Al...right.																						
39	40		301								Jamilah	Don't you want to know why there are so many guards today?																						
40	41		301								Sophia	...Did you know?																						
41	42		301								Jamilah	Not entirely. I only knew "someone" was coming today.																						
42	43		301								Jamilah	But I didn't know it was you.																						
43	44		301								Sophia	Do you... Know me?																						
44	45		301								Jamilah	I do. You are the only survivor of "that accident". The aristocrats' report never mentioned you, but I've been looking for you.																						
45	46		301								Sophia	You have no right to mention that "incident"!																						
46	47		301								Jamilah	Is that how they told you? That I was the culprit who refused to send reinforcements and caused the death of 47 maintenance members and 336 civilians?																						
47	48		301								Jamilah	What if I tell you another version of the story?																						
48	49		301								Sophia	I won't believe in you.																						
49	50		301								Jamilah	Neither do I think so. Andre told me about your personality in his letter.																						
50	51		301								Sophia	...What?																						
51	52		301								Jamilah	The leader of your maintenance squad, Andre. He was my undercover spy in the commoner carriage‚Äîone of the best.																						
52	53		301								Jamilah	He'd been asking me to find you and take care of you till his last breath.																						
53	54		301								Sophia	That's impossible. They were all...!																						
54	55		301								Jamilah	They were all dead, weren't they?																						
55	56		301								Jamilah	I hate to remind you of the past... But I hope at least this could make you trust me.																						
56	57		301									Jamilah reaches out to Sophia. In her hand is a royal badge with burn marks.																						
57	58		301								Sophia	...!																						
58	59		301								Jamilah	I'm sorry. I could only... Reduce his pain. Morphine was the only thing we could use...																						
59	60		301								Sophia	...																						
60	61		301								Jamilah	The last thing he spoke about was you...																						
61	62		301								Sophia	Why? Aren't you...																						
62	63		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Jamilah	You don't have to believe this, but it wasn't me.

68	69		204							2	4																							
69	70		301								Jamilah	It was that simple. Your hatred just happened to be useful to them.	2																					
70	71		301								Jamilah	I have evidence. A statement from the waiter in the noble carriage, as well as voice recordings of the escaped technicians.	2																					
71	72		301								Sophia	I see. What have I done...	1																					
72	73		204							2	2																							
73	74		301								Jamilah	It's okay. I don't blame you.	2

76	77		301								Jamilah	I'm a queen with no real power. All I see are illusions. All I can reach is my dressing table.	2																					
77	78		301								Jamilah	I can only find you and persuade you one by one, so you can bring me the truth.	2																					
78	79		301								Jamilah	I know if I keep doing this, "they" will want me dead sooner or later. Hmm... Maybe there is a different way to put this.	2																					
79	80		301								Jamilah	I guess I'm just not a good-looking puppet. Or, perhaps... I want to restore things to how they should be, just like my father did.	2																					
80	81		201							1	500126		-400																					
81	82		301							1	Aston	One day, my leader. One day they will.	1																					
82	83		301								Jamilah	You don't need to say those nice words, Aston. Time waits for no one. Only one side can survive this war.	2																					
83	84		301								Jamilah	But right now, we have only one problem to resolve.	2																					
84	85		301								Jamilah	Sophia, if you still want to kill me after hearing all that, you can do it now.	2

91	92		301								Jamilah	Aston, please help Sophia settle. She won't be able to go back to Ashlar after tonight.	2																					
92	93		301								Sophia	Why are you doing this?	1																					
93	94		301								Jamilah	As the oldest daughter of the royal family, I had no choice. Whether I liked it or not, my only destiny was to accept the scepter to the throne.	2																					
94	95		301								Jamilah	I could have become a tyrant, a wise queen, or a puppet I am now. The scepter couldn't be bothered at all.	2																					
95	96		301								Jamilah	But at least I want to make one more person have their choice.	2																					
96	97		301								Jamilah	So when I do something wrong, maybe they can come and tell me.	2
