19	19		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Outside the window, people are crying and whimpering. Everyone in town is trying to hide from the unknown terror. They are all trying to escape the house toward the woods, toward the sliver of hope to survive.																						
20	20		301									They rush to the gate outside Luna's house. Someone is banging on the door angrily—fear and rage have twisted all their faces, turning the familiar neighbors into strangers.																						
21	21		301									The Punishing Virus, meanwhile, floods into every corner of the town. The scarlet Corrupted chase down and toy with the armless humans like starved zombies.																						
22	22		301									You see "your" father attempting to come through against the tide of people, but he is too far away. So far that you cannot even tell whose name he is shouting.																						
23	23		301									But the thinly dressed man has barely shouted before being caught up by the "sheriff," whom he once proudly fought side by side. It opens its gaping metal jaw and crushes his head like a roaring flame devouring the land.																						
24	24		301									The waning faces you once saw in the hazy light in the M.I.N.D. suddenly clear up, like tearing a wound open, revealing the blood and flesh within.																						
25	25		301									"Your" mother, her hands trembling, is trying to move everything she can find in the garden behind the gate, hoping to keep the mechanical monsters on the other side.																						
26	26		301									She is such a kind mother—she always brings daisies from the market and gives them to the young girl in the wheelchair on the street, who was busking because she could not afford a mechanical prosthetic.																						
27	27		301									During Thanksgiving, the elderly people who live alone in the town will always receive cookies she bakes herself. She always has "you" help out in order to teach you to be kind and strong.																						
28	28		301									Her hands should be dancing on the piano, carrying a bouquet, or holding a bowl of hot soup.																						
29	29		301									Not drenching in blood, shaking, desperately trying to keep the gates closed.																						
30	30		301									She has to keep the others out, even those innocent and helpless. She watches them as the monsters strike, despite her husband being among them just a moment ago.																						
31	31		301									But all is futile.																						
32	32		301									The Corrupted and blood-soaked hands of pleading humans reach for her from the spaces between the bars, and with the most harrowing screams, they try to drag the poor woman into the abyss.																						
33	33		301								Mom	——																						
34	34		301									The last thing between the monsters and her daughters is her. She turns her back to the gate, pushing back, shaking from their unrelenting force. She looks toward the window on the second floor, where you are standing.																						
35	35		301									Tears cover her face. She leaves her last words as she weeps.																						
36	36		301								Mom	—Lucia, protect your sister.																						
37	37		301								Mom	—Run.																						
38	38		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					A terrifying mechanical arm pierces her chest, the blood pouring out of her scorches warmer than every embrace she has given... You cannot tell if those who tear her apart are monsters or broken humans after that.

42	42		301									The young girl's voice trembles. Her small, delicate hand tries to grab ahold of yours, only to find nothing there.																						
43	43		301									That is when she turns toward you. You see tears rolling down her cheeks, but she is not crying. She shows no expression, and you wonder if she registers what is happening at all.																						
44	44		301									This time she grabs your hand tightly, the feeling of her warm and soaked grip uncomfortably realistic.																						
45	45		202							1					1																			
46	46		301									Then she drags you and runs.																						
47	47		301									Run. But where to? What are those things? She knows her parents are gone, and no guardian angels are here to save them. Do they not deserve it? Have they done something wrong? Mom never told her. Where should she go?																						
48	48		301									Your eyes are soaked. Lucia has grabbed one of your hands, so you use your free arm to wipe your eyes. Nothing has ever poured out of you like this, save for vital fluid in previous battles.

50	50		301			RImgBg1Shake						Approaching the bedroom door, you trip on a doll and fall.																						
51	51		301									Your visuals drop. Time seems to dilate at that moment, and you notice that the doll that tripped you is an ugly stuffed frog, with its glass eyes and bright-red lips sewn on its woolly fabric.																						
52	52		301									"I've seen it before."																						
53	53		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					"It looks fluffy and soft, unlike the first time I saw it."

57	57		302								What happened?	58																						
58	58		301									You know what happened, but the owner of these memories is so frightened and lost. Her confusion takes over you, and you cannot help but ask.																						
59	59		302			DialogDisable					Dad and Mom were bleeding so much...	60																						
60	60		302								Everyone was...	61																						
61	61		301			DialogEnable						Lucia holds you in your arms, trying to warm her sister with her own body's warmth. She takes a deep breath next to your ear—your face is buried in her arms, so you cannot tell her expression.																						
62	62		301								Lucia	...Luna, do you remember the two of us sneaking on Dad's terminal?																						
63	63		302								Yeah...	64																						
64	64		301								Lucia	We watched a scary movie with many horrifying monsters, and they ate a lot of people.																						
65	65		301									Luna seems to have remembered something, and you tremble even more intensely. Lucia holds you closer.																						
66	66		302								It was scary... There was a lot of blood...	67																						
67	67		301								Lucia	Someone is making a horror movie like that in our town. I forgot to tell you.																						
68	68		302								How did you know?	69																						
69	69		401							2	1503																							
70	70		301									You hear a loud, dull thud from downstairs. It spreads to your ears like a raindrop falling from a petal into the mud.																						
71	71		301									Lucia is breathing harder now.																						
72	72		301								Lucia	Dad told me, and he said not to tell you. He wanted to scare you.																						
73	73		302								...Really?	74	I don't believe you...	74																				
74	74		301								Lucia	It's true! Luna, I'd never lie to you. If I do, I'm a... I'm a rat!																						
75	75		302								You scared me!	76																						
76	76		301									More tears roll down your face. You can feel a comfort soothing your fear, despite the real you knowing that this is a lie underneath.																						
77	77		301								Lucia	I'm sorry, Luna... but you're part of the movie as well. They can only shoot it once, so you have to listen to me and perform well, okay?																						
78	78		302								But I don't want to... I just want to find Mom and Dad...	79																						
79	79		401							2	1503

83	83		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		Loosening her hug, Lucia instead grabs your shoulders and looks straight at you. The tears on her face have almost dried, and she has never looked so serious.																						
84	84		301								Lucia	You're a grown-up now, Luna. You have to be strong. Even when Mom and Dad are not here with you, you have to be strong.	1																					
85	85		302								Will you be here with me the whole time?	86																						
86	86		301								Lucia	I will. Now, you have to act brave. You're going to waste everybody's effort if you don't.	1																					
87	87		302								...Okay. Will it be scary?	88																						
88	88		301								Lucia	A little bit, but you don't need to be afraid. I'll come back for you.	1																					
89	89		301								Lucia	You're the best at hide-and-seek, aren't you?	1																					
90	90		302								...I am!	91																						
91	91		301								Lucia	Don't let the monsters catch you.	1																					
92	92		301									Lucia stands and pulls you up.																						
93	93		301								Lucia	Hide in the basement, now!	1																					
94	94		302								Come with me...	95																						
95	95		301								Lucia	The monsters are inside already... If someone doesn't distract them, we'll both get caught!	1

103	103		301									Never in her life has she heard a promise like that, whether as a human in the research institute or a Construct in Cerberus.	1																					
104	104		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Affected by this memory, an unknown strength spreads through her body. She genuinely believes everything the girl before her has said, and No. 21 cannot tell if it comes from the memory or herself.	1
