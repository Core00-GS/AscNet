22	22		301							1		Under the lead-gray sky, machine parts pile up into a large mound. Waving her banner spear, she sends Corrupted flying into the air one after another. She is like a dancer gliding among dozens of partners in an intricate dance of death.																						
23	23		302								Vera.	24																						
24	24		301									As for you, you stand behind her, dodging scrap metal as you watch the fierce spectacle unfold.																						
25	25		302								I have a question.	26																						
26	26		301								Vera	What?	1																					
27	27		301									The dancer has no intention of looking back. She only glances at you as she spins around with her spear, seemingly casting you a look of "don't bother me if you're okay."																						
28	28		302								Why am I in the back?	29																						
29	29		301				DialogDisable				Vera	Isn't it normal for a commandant to stand at the rear and watch from a safe distance while Constructs fight the Corrupted on the front line? What's wrong?	1																					
30	30		302								Not every commandant fights like that.	31																						
31	31		302								But that's not what I mean.	32																						
32	32		301			DialogEnable						She is right that it is a common tactic for commandants to assign Constructs to fight on the front line while they provide support from the rear. However, the problem is...																						
33	33		401							2	1503																							
34	34		301									Skint! Vera runs her banner spear right through another Corrupted's frame. The body is powerless to resist, but the limbs writhe in the air, indicating the need for one more final blow.																						
35	35		301									She turns a blind eye and tosses the Corrupted behind her carelessly. The struggling Corrupted lands in front of you, its bright red lens pointing at you as it lets out a harsh metal shriek.

39	39		302								...Here we go again.	40																						
40	40		202							1					1																			
41	41		301									The problem is that Vera is not actually killing any of the Corrupted. Instead, she is merely slashing them a few times and tossing them to the side. Since the mission started, you have been forced to finish the job as Corrupted bodies continue to pile up.																						
42	42		301									The original plan was for you to stay in close proximity to Vera to widen the safe zone. But with her flailing around her banner spear, she is like a fierce rose in battle. Get too close, and you will get stabbed by a thorn.																						
43	43		201							1	500013																							
44	44		401							2	1508																							
45	45		301							1	Corrupted	Urgh...	1																					
46	46		401							2	1510																							
47	47		301			PanelActor1Shake						You raise your gun and shoot, causing the red light on its lens to fade to black. Its sharp claws, just one inch from stabbing you, fall to the ground.																						
48	48		302								You did that on purpose, didn't you? Letting them approach?	49																						
49	49		201							1	500345	13																						
50	50		301							1	Vera	Find that out just now?	1																					
51	51		301									Clearing the way in front of her, she slows down her pace and throws a sarcastic smile at you between the fighting.																						
52	52		204							1	2																							
53	53		301								Vera	Don't you fight like this, Gray Raven Commandant? I'm just having you help clean up the aftermath.	1																					
54	54		302								This is how you want me to help?	55	I wouldn't exactly call this "helping."	55																				
55	55		301								Vera	Haha, think what you like. If you are afraid, blame yourself for taking part in this mission.	1																					
56	56		301								Vera	But we can't quit now. We're almost at the mission location.	1																					
57	57		202							1					1																			
58	58		301									Right at that moment, Vera stops. She plunges her spear into the ground and kneels down.																						
59	59		301									Mechanoid ruins spread out before you. A dusty metallic smell seems to linger in the gray air. An array of mechanical parts are stacked at random. Among the piles, you catch occasional glimpses of movement.																						
60	60		201							1	500013																							
61	61		401							2	1508																							
62	62		301							1	Corrupted	Rgh—Aargh!	1																					
63	63		301									Right where Vera is kneeling, a mechanoid hand bursts out from the ground as the Corrupted roars. The mechanoid still bears some human resemblance. It must have been a destroyed Construct.																						
64	64		201							1	500345	2																						
65	65		301							1	Vera	Hmph! How can a pile of junk this infected even move?	1																					
66	66		204							1	13																							
67	67		301								Vera	Whatever... Time to die!	1																					
68	68		301									As if too lazy to pull out her banner spear, she shoves her fist into the Corrupted's core.																						
69	69		401							2	578																							
70	70		402					400		578																								
71	71		301									Ka-cha... You seem to hear a faint ticking like that of a mechanical heart. Suddenly, the Corrupted's rigid body collapses into Vera's arms like a sleeping infant.																						
72	72		301								Vera	Let's see if this Corrupted's got anything...	1																					
73	73		301									Vera kneels down lower and feels around the Corrupted's frame, which no longer shows any sign of functionality.																						
74	74		202							1					1																			
75	75		301									You cannot see what she is doing from where you stand. All you can do is listen.																						
76	76		401							2	570																							
77	77		301									At first, you hear the faint sound of friction.																						
78	78		401							2	1506																							
79	79		301									Following that, you hear the clanging thud of metal hitting metal.																						
80	80		401							2	574																							
81	81		301									Finally, you hear a deafening bang as she finally stands up from the Corrupted. She fixes her hair with the hand holding a dangling bundle of parts.																						
82	82		201							1	500345	8																						
83	83		301							1	Vera	Ugh, recovering resources is always such a pain in the ***. What were the higher-ups thinking just sending one Construct? I guess I'll scavenge while we inspect the place.	1																					
84	84		302								Need my help?	85																						
85	85		204							1	13																							
86	86		301								Vera	You? What do you know? Stand back and don't get in my way.	1																					
87	87		204							1	2																							
88	88		301								Vera	Of course, if you're so interested in Construct autopsies, I won't object. But don't blame me if scrap just so happens to come flying out and slit your throat.	1																					
89	89		302								Forget it...	90																						
90	90		202							1					1																			
91	91		301									Autopsy... Although official statements from Babylonia use more politically correct terminology, Vera does not bother mincing words when referring to the mission objective.																						
92	92		301									Aside from recovering resources, the objective of your mission is to investigate the area—that includes the dead soldiers here.																						
93	93		301									This sort of mission is not particularly uncommon, but you rarely participate. That being said, most participants are not like Vera.																						
94	94		201							1	500345	2																						
95	95		301							1	Vera	Oh, look at the tracks here. Seems like this group of Constructs put up quite the resistance before they died despite not knowing a single thing about tactics.	1																					
96	96		301								Vera	But their cores were obliterated. Ha. It's not that they didn't have the strength to continue fighting—they just gave up in despair. I guess they must have seen something.	1																					
97	97		204							1																								
98	98		301								Vera	2 o'clock. Looks like it started with that Construct hanging upside down. That's their captain.	1																					
99	99		204							1	8																							
100	100		301								Vera	Let's see... They probably stuck to the front line here. They lasted about five waves—no, six. Right as they were able to go on the offensive, they saw a giant Corrupted crush their captain and kick him into the tree.	1																					
101	101		204							1																								
102	102		301								Vera	After that, they couldn't even stand a single wave before they were overrun.	1																					
103	103		202							1					1																			
104	104		301								Vera	Hmph. Men without a banner. What a pity.	1

106	106		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
107	107		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Unwilling to continue listening, you close your eyes.																						
108	108		301									Vera slowly and methodically describes the fallen soldiers' final battle.																						
109	109		301									Some fought desperately, some sacrificed their lives, and some fled. Just listening to her analysis, you vividly imagine what they must have experienced on the battlefield. And the final moments before their deaths.																						
110	110		301									Now, their final moments have been pulled out of the dust by Vera, dissected and analyzed, becoming the material for studying the battle.																						
111	111		301									How should one react when hearing their final moments? You do not know what to feel.																						
112	112		301									But Vera does, with certainty. She is just carrying out her mission, recording those endings and bringing them to light.																						
113	113		301									Just like her nickname, "Death". A Grim Reaper.																						
114	114		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory394.jpg																								
115	115		201							1	500345																							
116	116		301							1	Vera	Hey, Gray Raven Commandant. I know I told you to stay away from me, but are you really going to just stand there and daydream?	1																					
117	117		204							1	2																							
118	118		301								Vera	Keep that up, and you'll be a permanent resident here. Shouldn't you familiarize yourself with the surrounding area first?	1																					
119	119		302								That won't be necessary.	120	I've already bought a house here.	120																				
120	120		301								Vera	Really? Then suit yourself.	1																					
121	121		204							1	8																							
122	122		301								Vera	I don't have time to look after you. Take care of yourself if any Corrupted ambush us.	1																					
123	123		302								...Got it.	124	(Walk over)	124																				
124	124		204							1	13																							
125	125		301								Vera	Hmph, good.	1																					
126	126		301									Looking up from the broken mechanical parts, Vera suddenly smiles at you.																						
127	127		202							1					1																			
128	128		301									Right at that moment, she pulls out a small part from within the Construct's frame. It's a half-full glass tube containing a vibrant green solution.																						
129	129		302								What's this?	130																						
130	130		301									Seeing this peculiar object, your curiosity causes you to speak without thinking.																						
131	131		201							1	500345																							
132	132		301							1	Vera	Huh? You think I—	1																					
133	133		301									Vera hesitates as if deliberating whether or not to belabor a response.																						
134	134		204							1	1																							
135	135		301									Her eyebrows twitch, then she blinks twice before smiling a big toothy grin.																						
136	136		301								Vera	Well, alright... Since you saw it, I'll tell you.	1																					
137	137		301									She throws the glass capsule high into the air and catches it.																						
138	138		204							1	2																							
139	139		301								Vera	This little fella is called an inverse scale inhibitor dispersant. It's a top-secret reagent developed by Babylonia.	1																					
140	140		302								An inverse... what?	141																						
141	141		204							1																								
142	142		301								Vera	Forget it. The point is... it's top-secret. Most of the information on its production and ingredients won't see the light of day—some of which cause humans to feel excruciating pain.	1																					
143	143		302								That's why you were dealing with those suspicious people?																							
144	144		204							1	4																							
145	145		301								Vera	Oh, you still remember that. Then you should know that this thing must be kept secret.	1																					
146	146		204							1	2																							
147	147		301								Vera	I won't go into detail. But to put it simply, this thing is kind of a cardiac stimulant that can be administered to people on the brink of death via intravenous injection.	1																					
148	148		301								Vera	This thing exists in every Construct, just under the spine. It's impossible to remove without disassembling the entire Construct like I did just now.	1																					
149	149		301								Vera	Hmph. If this ever gets out, how many commandants do you think will request Constructs to crack open their frames to save themselves during crises? You know how it is between Commandants and Constructs.	1																					
150	150		301								Vera	That's why this tech has been kept top-secret all this time to prevent that from happening. Only a handful of honorary commandants are authorized to know.	1																					
151	151		302								Is that... why you're telling me?	152																						
152	152		301								Vera	Yep! You're now an honorary member, Gray Raven Commandant. Now that you know this secret, you can order your team to find a Construct to save yourself when your life is in danger.	1																					
153	153		301								Vera	I'm sure your team members will fall all over each other trying to help you.	1																					
154	154		302								...I wouldn't let them do that.	160	Cut the crap.	155																				
155	155		204							1																								
156	156		301								Vera	Not bad. People who think this is fake are the best at keeping secrets. Keep at it.	1																					
157	157		204							1	1																							
158	158		301								Vera	But when you're one foot in the grave, I can't wait to see you begging them to use this lil' thing.	1																					
159	159		302								Never.	160																						
160	160		202							1					1																			
161	161		301									You respond without even taking time to consider the possibility.																						
162	162		301									Regardless if what Vera said was true or not, you would never choose to do that on the battlefield. Whether it is Gray Raven or other Constructs, you would never want to put them in harm's way.																						
163	163		301									This is the only thing you can firmly answer.																						
164	164		201							1	500345																							
165	165		301							1	Vera	...Is that so?	1																					
166	166		301									Vera just shrugs.																						
167	167		301								Vera	Forget it. Doesn't matter. I'm done recovering the resources here. Let's return to the conservation area.	1																					
168	168		301									She stands up and casually kicks away the Construct scattered on the floor. She throws over the parts she collected from the surrounding area, implying for you to carry them back.																						
169	169		204							1	2																							
170	170		301								Vera	Alright, let's get going.	1																					
171	171		301									Her tone becomes sharp and pretentious, reminding you of those birds with names you cannot pronounce in those nature documentaries.																						
172	172		301								Vera	Dear Com—man—dant—	1																					
173	173		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					You nearly gag at the sound of such a sweet and intimate tone, which causes your body to tense up.
