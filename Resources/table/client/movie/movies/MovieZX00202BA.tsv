27	24		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Lucia	We've reached the coordinates for deploying the Iso-Devices. We'll have to deploy them every 1.5km until it links up with the devices from the other squads.	1																					
28	25		301								Liv	The map shows that the other squads are already on the move. We have to hurry.	2																					
29	26		302								Wait...	27																						
30	27		301								Lucia	Is something the matter, Commandant?	1																					
31	28		204							2	7		2																					
32	29		301								Liv	There's a... connection request from a nearby Construct?	2																					
33	30		204							2																								
34	31		301								Liv	It's from... deep within the Corrupted zones.	2																					
35	32		301								Lucia	Do we know their identity?	1																					
36	33		301								Liv	Please wait...	2																					
37	34		301								Liv	Okay, I got it. The Construct's named "Tifa", a Support-type Construct, member of the Suzaku squad.	2																					
38	35		301								Liv	But according to historical records, the Suzaku commandant had been confirmed KIA a few days prior. All Constructs lost connection, and no one was recalled...	2

41	38		301							1	Lee	If I remember correctly, the massive loss of Construct squads also began around that time.	1																					
42	39		301								Lee	We mistook the Nozzle model as the culprit before, due to the lack of any intact survivor memories and information.	1																					
43	40		201							1	1031001																							
44	41		301							1	Liv	So the true culprit is this Corrupted named "Iron Maiden"?	1

48	45		301							1	Lucia	Commandant! I... advise against linking with this signal...	1																					
49	46		301								Lucia	Connecting with more than 3 Constructs at a time will place a heavy burden on your mind, Commandant.	1																					
50	47		301								Lucia	And, from our previous experience, this could be a trap as well. We do not know if it might cause any danger to you, Commandant.	1

62	59		301							1	Lucia	Sorry, I should not have been relieved for the loss of contact with other Constructs.	1

69	66		301								Lee	However, the Punishing Virus can't affect humans on a cognitive level. That's humanity's only advantage against the virus. This is why we fight along side commandants.	2
