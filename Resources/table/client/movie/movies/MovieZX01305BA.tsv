128	131		301							1	Asimov	...Okay. Then I'll begin.	1																					
129	132		301								Asimov	As you should already know, the M.I.N.D. is a system designed to maintain human consciousness for Constructs...	1																					
130	133		301								Asimov	And for some reason, someone added in a set of general-purpose computer I/O terminals to the virtual human brain neural array structure...	1																					
131	134		301								Asimov	...Wait. I think I was that very someone. Well, whatever.	1																					
132	135		301								Asimov	In a nutshell, if the M.I.N.D. can't find the corresponding solution in its error library, the GPC part will endlessly try to open a door that doesn't exist.	1																					
133	136		301								Asimov	Because it only remembers that door.	1																					
134	137		301								Asimov	Even if you, the owner, have moved away from home, kicked it, or if you're head-banging to heavy metal, it'll still keep looking for you. In short, it'll keep looking for the designated doorway until it finds it.	1																					
135	138		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryTongxunHalfNew.prefab		1																					
136	139		201							1	1081001	5																						
137	140		301							1	Camu	So what's that gotta do with me?	1

139	142		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryTongxunHalfNew.prefab		1																						
140	143		301							1	Asimov	If you're just another average Construct, then it wouldn't matter. But you're not.	1																					
141	144		301								Asimov	Your signals are a hodgepodge, but there are characteristic signals of the Ascension-Network in your Inver-Device echoes.	1																					
142	145		301								Asimov	This means that, though you're not an Ascendant, you're still similar to one.	1																					
143	146		301								Everyone	!!!																						
144	147		301								Asimov	Based on 【kuroname】's description of the situation earlier, I have decided to classify these Ascendant-like beings with special characteristics like you as "Transcendants."	1																					
145	148		302								Transcendant?	149																						
146	149		301								Asimov	Yes, a Transcendant. Because of the Ascendant nature of Camu from what you have described, and the in-between state of them being on the "the other side" of a Construct, but not to the point of being an Ascendant.	1																					
147	150		301								Asimov	For now, all we know is that Camu's "transcendence" is the work of Roland. Roland has granted him Ascendant characteristics somehow.	1																					
148	999001		301								Asimov	Comparing it with previous cases, we can see that Camu's case bears a high degree of similarity to the Kowloong leader Qu.	1																					
149	151		302								...Huh.	152																						
150	152		301								Asimov	And, Camu's appearance has essentially confirmed a hypothesis I reached with President Hassen before: There are more Ascendants than the ones that we know of.	1																					
151	153		301								Asimov	There are likely Ascendants with other purposes in mind, or even Ascendants who are willing to work with us.	1																					
152	154		301								Asimov	Ah, I seem to have gone off topic. Let's continue.	1																					
153	155		301								Asimov	Let's return to the door metaphor. "Camu", you are the one who moved houses, making the control system in your body unable to find the door home. That is what happened.	1																					
154	156		301								Asimov	If you are indeed the Camu from the Kurono data I have, you have transferred the I/O terminal ownership to Kamui in the past to let him take charge.	1																					
155	157		301								Asimov	In other words, your consciousness does not have the authority to access or use most of the terminals on this frame.	1																					
156	158		301								Asimov	Action module terminals keep no locks—you feed them any signals and they'll move. But your energy-related terminals require additional plug-ins and authentication...	1																					
157	159		301								Asimov	When the superuser consciousness enters a lockdown for some reason, other consciousnesses can do nothing about the energy system going out of control.	1																					
158	160		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryTongxunHalfNew.prefab		1																					
159	161		201							1	1081001	5

162	164		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryTongxunHalfNew.prefab		1																						
163	165		301							1	Asimov	Return to Babylonia for maintenance and repairs. We'll completely separate you from Kamui and plug your consciousness to another frame.	1																					
164	166		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryTongxunHalfNew.prefab		1

169	171		301							1	Asimov	Of course, because of the unknown factor of Tenebrion, even if we separate you from Kamui... We can't guarantee that Kamui will recover.	1																					
170	172		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryTongxunHalfNew.prefab		1

175	177		301							1	Asimov	But this should be able to buy both you and us the necessary time to solve the problem, at least.	1																					
176	178		301								Asimov	【kuroname】, before you went on your vacation, I remember giving you a special tech prototype...	1																					
177	179		301								Asimov	It's a little something I made after getting ideas from the collars on the Nighter. It's essentially a necklace-sized remote connection pod.	1																					
178	180		302								...	181																						
179	181		301								Asimov	What are you waiting for? Finding it weird that it's so small? Hurry up and whip it out.	1																					
180	182		302								(Whip out prototype necklace)	183																						
181	183		301								Asimov	Put it on. Then I'll explain.	1																					
182	184		302								...I demand an explanation first.	185	(Put on the necklace)	190																				
183	185		301								Asimov	It's pretty much the same thing as from April Fools' Day.	1																					
184	186		301								Asimov	But I remade it into a system-on-a-chip, and then had the WGAA make me a shell.	1																					
185	187		301								Asimov	Then I wrote a masking algorithm that reduces the consciousness stress to 0.27% of the original, even with the same power output.	1																					
186	188	189	301								Asimov	And then some more tech magic, and it's done.	1																					
187	189		302								(Put on the necklace)	190																						
188	190		301								Asimov	Okay, caught the signal. Camu, I want you to get as close to 【kuroname】 as you can.	1

225	228		301								Asimov	Too much trouble rewriting a visual interface for a Transcendant. Camu will be the one doing the fighting anyway, not you. So I redirected your visuals to his M.I.N.D. instead of the frame.	1																					
226	229		301								Asimov	You'll be fine as long as you have access to the energy modules and tactical authority. Which is why I'm keeping everything simple.	1																					
227	230		301								Asimov	Transcendants might require a completely different system at the root level... It might take some time to create a full set of compatible terminals. The frame will also have to be redesigned the way Nikola intended...	1

234	237		301							1	Asimov	Okay! Then it's sorted. You can stop worrying about the small stuff. I'll provide 【kuroname】 with a signal reference for visual support. You should head towards Roland with the others.	1																					
235	238		301								Asimov	I found traces of his signal a little further ahead of you. Looks like he's still keeping a close eye on your condition.	1

246	249		301								Roland	Such a bad, bad boy—squirming through the filtering this way.	1																					
247	250		301								Roland	Did you know? Most converted Constructs become zealots of hatred and despair, when those emotions are merely amplified by the filtering...	1
