3	3		301			DialogEnable						The decks of the Nighter—a floating stronghold tasked with perimeter and maritime defense—is littered with the dead and dying, consequences of a costly battle against the Ascendant earlier in the day.																						
4	4		301									Apart from the Nighter crew, there are also members of the Forsaken and the ACA, who have stayed to bolster the defense.																						
5	5		301									Striding past them, Pulao can manage nothing more than nods of appreciation—she had more pressing matters to attend to.

7	7		301							1	Pulao	Be careful! Lash the corners tight. Did they not teach you how to tie knots?	1																					
8	8		301									Pulao is directing the Nighter crew to move the vast amounts of cargo still on board the ship.																						
9	9		301								Pulao	There is only so much that we can carry. All this precious cargo, supplies that have kept the Voyage afloat for all this time. A tragedy, to be honest......	1																					
10	10		301									Having lived on board for such a long time, Pulao has conflicted feelings about the Nighter.																						
11	11		301								Pulao	They've all scurried ashore and left this mess for me to clean up. The Nighter is so quiet—eh? Perhaps not so quiet after all.	1

13	13		301									Next to a haphazard collection of cargo, two bands of people are locked into a standoff. Judging by their outfits, neither belong to the crew.

18	17		301								Sophia	It is not nonsensical for the cargo to go to the highest bidder.	2																					
19	18		301								Forsaken Soldier	What you call "highest bidder", I call "cutting in line"! The Nighter promised us this cargo. We had a deal!	1

21	20		301							1	Jamilah	They would sell one of their own if the price was right. An oral contract means nothing to them.	2

23	22		301								Forsaken Soldier	Watanabe-San ordered us to procure supplies here. We will not leave empty-handed!	1

37	36		301									At Jamilah's command, Sophia draws her Dual Guns, laying down suppressive fire and covering Jamilah's retreat.
