46	47		301								Construct Soldier 3	What happened?	3																					
47	48		301								Construct Soldier 2	Not sure, but apparently some of the guys guarding the place defected, and God only knows where they went.	2																					
48	49		301								Construct Soldier 1	...All these disasters over the past few months are pretty disconcerting. Say, do you think they're hanging out with Ascendants now?	1																					
49	50		301								Construct Soldier 2	Ascendants? No way...	2																					
50	51		301								Construct Soldier 1	Oh, yes way. Who wouldn't want to be immune to the virus, right? I mean, not everyone can be, but better giving it a try than waiting around.	1																					
51	52		301								Construct Soldier 3	C'mon, you're talking out of your ass.	3																					
52	53		301								Construct Soldier 1	I'm not. See, people have been talking about this. They think there is no end to all this fighting, so they'd rather keep their options open—for example, by joining the ranks of Ascendants and see if they get lucky.	1
