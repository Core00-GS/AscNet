7	7	10	301								Liv	No. This is training.	1

9	9		301								Liv	This is... an additional exercise for the training...	1																					
10	10		301								Liv	Apart from combat and tactics... I thought of a way to assist you in your daily life, Commandant.	1																					
11	11		301								Liv	So I thought I'd give it a try.	1																					
12	12		301								Liv	I can wake you up every morning and prepare breakfast for you.	1																					
13	13		301								Liv	I can prepare tea, coffee, or cute little cakes for you during your free time.	1																					
14	14		301								Liv	I can even prepare your bed for you before you go to bed at night.	1																					
15	15		301								Liv	Like a fam... or a maid.	1																					
16	16		302								Isn't that too luxurious for the lives we have right now?	17	I don't think Constructs are needed for these kinds of work.	18																				
17	17	19	301								Liv	I'm preparing for the inevitable future...	1																					
18	18		301								Liv	It's something I want to do.	1																					
19	19		301								Liv	I believe that with you and everyone, we will reclaim Earth one day...	1																					
20	20		301								Liv	And when we find each other on the surface, we would still be the commandant's Gray Ravens, right?	1																					
21	21		302								Of course.	22	As long as our squad isn't disbanded.	22																				
22	22		301								Liv	Then this training is necessary.	1																					
23	23		301								Liv	Like, the way we greet each other when me meet...	1

25	25		301								Liv	W-welcome back... M-mast—	1																					
26	26		302								This is too embarrassing!	27	You really don't have to call me "master."	28																				
27	27	29	301								Liv	I'm actually quite embarrassed as well... How about I call you something else?	1																					
28	28		301								Liv	Is that so? I thought you would enjoy being called that... In that case—	1
