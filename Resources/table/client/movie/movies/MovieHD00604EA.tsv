46	46		301								Celica	I think you should come and see for yourself.	2																					
47	47		301									Hassen walks up to Celica's terminal and finds more than a dozen files pulled up on her terminal screen.																						
48	48		301									From newspaper clippings during the Golden Age to ground intel shared by the Forsaken.																						
49	49		301									All of which share a single commonality—the circular logo of the School.																						
50	50		301								Hassen	What's this?	1																					
51	51		301								Celica	Even though the World Government was unable to catch any of its members, it did find many hidden facilities belonging to the School all over the world.	2																					
52	52		301								Hassen	Lagerman Royal Arsenal... A warehouse in Port Bian'an...	1																					
53	53		301								Hassen	Putting all this information together, it seems that the scope of the School far exceeds our expectations.	1																					
54	54		301								Celica	However, when troops entered the facilities, they found that the facilities had been emptied—no materials, no products.	2																					
55	55		301								Celica	But according to logistics data, the raw materials in circulation there would be enough to make both light and heavy equipment for a small army.	2																					
56	56		301								Celica	But whatever they made with these materials had disappeared along with them.	2																					
57	57		301								Hassen	What could they have made with raw materials and machinery of this scale?	1																					
58	58		301								Hassen	It seems like they've been long gone, but I still have a sneaking suspicion that...	1																					
59	59		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Hassen	...Maybe it's only just a suspicion.	1
