5	5		301			DialogEnable				1	Roland	Hey, are you sure this is the way? And why aren't you flying me there if you have wings...	1																					
6	6		301									Roland slows down and sighs, complaining intentionally—he has to figure out a way to stall and get rid of the woman before him.																						
7	7		201							1	500326																							
8	8		301							1	Voodoo	Fine by me. As long as you're not worried about falling from the sky and turning into a piece of junk.	1

10	10		301							1	Roland	Come on! I'm your comrade, am I not? Is that how you treat your comrades? How concerning...	1																					
11	11		201							1	500326																							
12	12		301							1	Voodoo?	Boy! You're not one of us! You stay around Mister because of your own agenda! We've never considered you as our comrade!	1																					
13	13		301								Voodoo	Why do you insist on finding that agent? She has lost all her power. She should be worth nothing to you.	1																					
14	14		201							1	500334	1																						
15	15		301							1		Roland smiles. From Voodoo's inept probing, he is sure that this woman is here to keep an eye on him instead of accompanying him—her acting still has a long way to go.																						
16	16		301								Roland	Luna lost her power but not her status as an agent, which means Ascnet hasn't completely rejected her. If I can find her, perhaps I can find a way to obtain that status from her...	1																					
17	17		301									And there it is: the perfect lie is always an ounce of falsehood enshrouded in truth. Now, he just needs to find out if Voodoo will be convinced.																						
18	18		201							1	500326																							
19	19		301							1	Voodoo?	You? Madness! More so than us!	1

21	21		301							1	Roland	Is it now? At least, I think it's a decent goal to aim for. Otherwise, what fun there is to stay alive...	1																					
22	22		301									Voodoo suddenly stops, and Roland also pauses.																						
23	23		204							1																								
24	24		301								Roland	(Did she find out? No...)	1																					
25	25		201							1	500326																							
26	26		301							1	Voodoo	We're here. It's underneath this ruin...	1																					
27	27		201							1	500334																							
28	28		301							1		Roland observes his surrounding quietly. Nothing is out of the ordinary—that said, there were plenty of opportunities on their way here for Voodoo to strike had she wanted.																						
29	29		204							1	1																							
30	30		301								Roland	Sigh... Finally. What a terrible journey that has been!	1																					
31	31		201							1	500326																							
32	32		301							1	Voodoo	We would've been here sooner had you not been complaining.	1																					
33	33		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Roland shrugs dramatically before following Voodoo into the ruins.
