13	8		301									But, in the middle of the charging up, a pillar of energy burns through the air from the sky, detonating the ball of energy, causing Gabriel's arm to explode from the chain reaction. Smokes surrounds Gabriel in an instant.																						
14	9		301								Gabriel	Death from above... So this is what you've been hiding?	1																					
15	10		301								Lee	If it makes you feel better, sure. Just a satellite attack. Took a while to get it connected.	2

22	13		301									Lee talks while advancing and suppressing Gabriel, pushing him back through the continuous orbital attacks. Under the onslaught, Gabriel can no longer dodge all the attacks, but is forced to defend and block as well.

25	14		301							1	Gabriel	A commendable attempt. But once the interval and the range of the attack is laid bare, that orbital attack becomes a mere toy. I'll finish you now!	1

46	23		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The scattered beams of light drizzle like rain into the chamber. The flower petals around become torn and soar from the impact of the energy. Dust clouds billow, obscuring everyone's vision.																						
47	24		301								Gabriel	...I had thought Roland's pride led to his downfall. But it appears I was gravely mistaken.
