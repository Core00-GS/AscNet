6	6		301									The person who believed the nightmare was over has come right back into another nightmare.																						
7	7		301									The snow is knee-deep. You struggle to trudge forward. The pain and fatigue are wearing you down. You can fall at any time if you are not careful.

9	9		301									According to Liv in the dream, this memory is about "death."
