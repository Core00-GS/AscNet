3	3		301			DialogEnable						Despite your repeat requests to stay at the Forsaken headquarters, Watanabe still insists on departing as scheduled‚Äîand so the supply run that helps cover the data collecting mission is also coming to an end.																						
4	4		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					For some reason, Watanabe takes the wheel of the vehicle and drives.

6	6		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Watanabe	The next part is up to you guys.																						
7	7		301								Watanabe	I do feel more uncomfortable the closer we are to the Babylonian area.																						
8	8		301								Watanabe	Oh, right. There's something I want you to keep.																						
9	9		301									Watanabe turns on the automatic pilot and turns to throw you a jacket.																						
10	10		301								Watanabe	This jacket works much better in a desert than the uniform you're wearing.																						
11	11		301								Watanabe	What's with the face? Relax, it's just a jacket.																						
12	12		301								Watanabe	Do you have really good memories, or do you just hold a massive grudge?																						
13	13		302								Huh, it doesn't come with mint leaves this time.	14	Can't it be both?	15																				
14	14	16	301								Watanabe	...Good memories, then.																						
15	15		301								Watanabe	I'll give you the mint leaves next time.																						
16	16		301								Watanabe	Anyway, stay alert. We're not far from the next outpost.																						
17	17		301								Watanabe	By the way, the jacket comes with a Forsaken locator. It'll be more useful than mint leaves here.																						
18	18		302								Are you tracking me?	19	You can have it back.	20																				
19	19	21	301								Watanabe	You can't think that your people will let you go on a mission without some way to keep tabs on you?																						
20	20		301								Watanabe	Out of concern for your safety, just take it.																						
21	21		301								Watanabe	As a field agent, you really should be more urgent and self-aware. You don't want to cause more trouble, do you?																						
22	22		301									Inside the cockpit, Watanabe's voice sounds weary.																						
23	23		301									As you look outside the window at the unending stretch of the gray-blue sky, you cannot tell if it is day or night.																						
24	24		301									It is not bleakness but a real sense of expanse. After the outbreak of the Punishing Virus, this world no longer seems to be capable of drastic changes.																						
25	25		301									And the only glittering lights you can see are the snowdrops that hit the glass.

32	32		302								What... time is it?	33																						
33	33		301			DialogEnable						You hear Watanabe's voice as soon as the question comes into your mind.																						
34	34		201							1	1101001																							
35	35		301							1	Watanabe	Time to wake up, „Äêkuroname„Äë.	1																					
36	36		202							1					1																			
37	37		301									He stops the vehicle. Judging from the meter on the dashboard and looking with your own eyes, you are about one kilometer away from the outpost.																						
38	38		301									Strange as it is, you can more or less guess why Watanabe would park the vehicle here.																						
39	39		301									Regardless of your personal relationship, the world is still not big enough for both Babylonia and the Forsaken.																						
40	40		201							1	1101001																							
41	41		301							1	Watanabe	Almost time to say goodbye. This is as far as you can slack off, I'd say.	1																					
42	42		302								Aren't you coming along?	43	Time to say goodbye, indeed.	44																				
43	43	45	301								Watanabe	I don't think so.	1																					
44	44		301								Watanabe	At least you haven't forgotten where I stand.	1																					
45	45		301								Watanabe	It spells trouble if I approach the outpost, me being who I am. Not to mention... they are the ones who should be picking you up.	1																					
46	46		301								Watanabe	I'll get off here and wait for my men. I'm familiar with this region, so you don't have to worry.	1																					
47	47		301								Watanabe	Until next time, „Äêkuroname„Äë.	1																					
48	48		301								Watanabe	Godspeed, friend.	1																					
49	49		301									Watanabe puts on his protective gears again. Before he gets off, he picks up the jacket again and throws it toward you.																						
50	50		302								(Catch and wear it)	51	I won't throw it away.	51																				
51	51		301								Watanabe	Just don't lose it before you're back on Babylonia. Of course, I'll appreciate it if you return it next time we meet.	1																					
52	52		301								Watanabe	And it won't explode if it gets trashed. Consider it a token of camaraderie.	1																					
53	53		202							1					1																			
54	54		301									By the time the cockpit closes and the vehicle starts, the glass windows are covered with a thin layer of condensed vapor from the difference between the temperature inside and outside.																						
55	55		301									As the vehicle moves away, Watanabe's figure in the rearview mirror also slowly fades away, disappearing into the night.																						
56	56		301									The brief two-person journey has ended, and you are back on your own on an accident-free trip, just like the way it started.																						
57	57		301									...
