3	3		301			DialogEnable						Researchers have lined up in the corridor outside the canteen. The queue is incredibly long. Lamia cannot see its end.																						
4	4		301									A researcher seems to have remembered something. He exchanges a few words with the colleagues nearby and leaves.																						
5	5		401							2	1516																							
6	6		301									He leaves a gap behind, but it is almost consumed by the moving queue.																						
7	7		201							1	500351																							
8	8		301							1		Lamia looks around. No one seems to have noticed her tiny existence.																						
9	9		301									She immediately cuts inside before the gap disappears.																						
10	10		301									Another tall researcher behind her finally notices her. He gives an exhausted look. Lamia is not sure whether it is because of work or her.																						
11	11		201							1	500138																							
12	12		301							1	Researcher	You're... the girl raised by the medical department? Didn't they teach you the rules?	1																					
13	13		201							1	500351																							
14	14		301							1		Lamia cowers.																						
15	15		301									Of course she knows the rules. Colder than the sea water, but harder than ice.																						
16	16		301									Lamia shrinks into her shoulders, trying to make herself look weak. She opens her eyes wide to give an innocent look.																						
17	17		301									It doesn't always workâ€”in fact, it never worked. The books in the library mention that humans have an emotion named "sympathy," but it is an extremely rare sight in here.																						
18	18		301									Lamia anxiously stares at the researcher's eyes. The white light reflected on his glasses sends an inorganic chill up her spine.																						
19	19		301									He finally looks up again without talking.																						
20	20		301									It isn't out of sympathy. He has simply lost the interest for further interaction.																						
21	21		301									Great. Lamia feels relieved.																						
22	22		301									The queue continues to move slowly forward. She finally arrives at the white table after a long time.																						
23	23		301									There was always lots of food here for everyone to take. The canteen used to be very noisy.																						
24	24		301									But right now, the atmosphere feels dense and heavy. A row of logistics staff sit behind the table, each of them holding a writing board in their hands.																						
25	25		301									Behind them is another line of fully-armed security guards from the admin department keeping the order.																						
26	26		301									The logistics staff hasn't even looked at Lamia. He only stares at the roster in his hand.

32	32		301									He is still not looking up.																						
33	33		301								Lamia	L... La... Lamia.	2																					
34	34		301									His fingers run down the roster and finally come to a stop.																						
35	35		301								Logistics Staff	Calorie intake is limited to 1,164 kcals per day. These are your rations for today.	1																					
36	36		301									He puts two biscuit bars on the table.																						
37	37		301								Logistics Staff	Next.	1																					
38	38		301									Lamia gulps down some nervous saliva and tries to gather courage.																						
39	39		301									There is nothing wrong with trying. A failure can be tolerated.																						
40	40		301								Lamia	Um... Excuse me...	2																					
41	41		301								Logistics Staff	Is there a problem?	1																					
42	42		301								Lamia	Can I... get another biscuit? I'm really hungry...	2																					
43	43		301								Logistics Staff	No. Rations have been strictly calculated based on age, height, weight and daily activity level. This is all you have.	1																					
44	44		301									A security guard takes one step forward.																						
45	45		301									To them, children are treated as adults without any special privileges.																						
46	46		301								Logistics Staff	We only take queries about the expiry date or nutrition values. If you have other concerns, make a complaint to the admin department. There are lots of people waiting behind. Leave.	1

52	52		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The base immediately starts to limit the food supply after the Punishing outbreak.																						
53	53		301									In the beginning, the basket containing rations was placed on top of the table. The cans and biscuits were stacked like mountains.																						
54	54		301									Over time, the basket was moved next to the feet of logistics staff. Lamia had to stretch her neck to see it.																						
55	55		301									She can no longer see it now. The rations are probably hidden under the table.																						
56	56		301									What will happen in the future?																						
57	57		301									The book says that people will die from hunger if they have nothing to eat.																						
58	58		301									When many people die from hunger at once, it's called a famine.																						
59	59		301									Will there be a famine in the base?																						
60	60		201							1	500351																							
61	61		301							1		Am I going to die from hunger? Lamia thinks.																						
62	62		301									She has never seen the outside world.																						
63	63		301									The book also says the world outside Atlantis is much bigger.
