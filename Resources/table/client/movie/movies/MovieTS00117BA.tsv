6	6		301								Bianca	I've never seen anything like this in all my years serving on the surface.	1																					
7	7		301								Bianca	...If this desert holds the secret of an "antigen" to the virus, then it made sense that Babylonia would create a joint operation here in such short notice.	1																					
8	8		301								Bianca	Is there really an antigen? Are we... going to take back Earth?	1																					
9	9		301								Bianca	The value of this antigen is... immeasurable.	1

19	19		301								Bianca	To make sure that I'll get an accurate analysis from it...	1																					
20	20		301								Bianca	I'll have to increase the number of samples I collect...	1																					
21	21		301								Bianca	This will slow me down for sure, but at this point, I can't think of an alternative.	1
