4	4		301									Standing on either side of the port are deserted buildings—a telltale proof of yet another failed attempt by those who tried to conquer Antarctica.																						
5	5		301									The Constructs set up temporary tents of all sizes around the bay and pulleys that go from the ground up to the ship. In their polar suits, the Constructs travel back and forth between the tents and the ship with tools in hand. It is now apparent what they're trying to do—they're fixing the ship.

7	7		301							1	Bianca	An icebreaker from the Golden Age...?	1																					
8	8		204							1																								
9	9		301								Bianca	Is this what you meant to show us?	1																					
10	10		201							1	500028																							
11	11		301							1	Expedition Captain	Precisely. The expedition, the Engineering Force, and the Support Force—we put almost everyone we have here in Antarctica on this project to bring the icebreaker back to the sea.	1																					
12	12		201							1	500019																							
13	13		301							1	Expedition Member A	Half a month ago, our Pioneering Squad came across this dock and port from the Golden Age along with this deserted icebreaker around the bay.	1																					
14	14		301								Expedition Member A	Our Pioneering Squad believed this ship used to belong to the Transatlantic Economic Community—unfortunately, however, we didn't find any survivors around the port.	1																					
15	15		301								Expedition Member A	We didn't come across any traces of the Punishing Virus on the ship, although we did stumble across a few dozen decayed human bodies. All the blood traces and the bullet casings and guns around seem to suggest that there was a violent conflict.	1																					
16	16		201							1	500405																							
17	17		301							1	Expedition Member B	We have no idea what happened here at the port, but this much we know—what we have here is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.	1																					
18	18		301								Expedition Member B	If we can manage to get this icebreaker back to life, we'll be able to take our exploration drastically further—even to the Golden Age's extent!	1																					
19	19		301								Expedition Member B	And based on our assessment of the ship's damage level, getting it back to life is no daydream at all with the manpower and resources we have. It is, in fact, totally within our reach!	1																					
20	20		301									You see fires burning in their eyes as they speak.																						
21	21		201							1	500533	8																						
22	22		301							1	Bianca	...	1																					
23	23		301									Feeling their enthusiasm, Bianca keeps her eyes closed, apparently deep in thought.																						
24	24		302								What about that message though?	25																						
25	25		201							1	500028																							
26	26		301							1	Expedition Captain	If my memory serves me correctly, the message was originally a draft, and one of the guys from the Engineering Force stumbled across the draft box in the system trying to fix the telecommunication system on this ship a few days ago.	1																					
27	27		301								Expedition Captain	And it just so happened that the message was sent out by accident and reached Babylonia when we were testing for communication channels.	1																					
28	28		301								Expedition Captain	We don't know what it says in the message, but the fact that you're both here says something.	1																					
29	29		301									All the dead bodies, bullet traces, and violent conflict... It's anyone's guess what happened in the final moments of those on this ship in this corner of the world.																						
30	30		301								Expedition Captain	We did try to reach out immediately to Babylonia, though, except all our devices went down from the EMI that took place when we booted up the telecommunication system on the ship.	1																					
31	31		301								Expedition Captain	So we tried to go with a different channel, but with the snowstorm around, we weren't able to reach Babylonia through the long-wave communication we usually use.	1																					
32	32		301								Expedition Captain	And today, we were finally able to bring Babylonia up to speed on what we'd been doing over the past half a month and our discovery of this icebreaker.	1																					
33	33		201							1	500019																							
34	34		301							1	Expedition Member A	See, we'd just finished updating Babylonia and were about to laze away right when you barged in...	1																					
35	35		302								So this whole thing is just...	36																						
36	36		302								A huge misunderstanding?	37																						
37	37		201							1	500533	8																						
38	38		301							1	Bianca	Uhm...	1																					
39	39		301									Hearing everything the expedition just said, Bianca is lost for words.																						
40	40		202							1					1																			
41	41		401							2	1099																							
42	42		301									Right then, both your and Bianca's terminals start ringing.																						
43	43		302								One second, please.	44																						
44	44		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Nodding to the expedition and alighting from the vehicle, you and Bianca find a spot with no one around and start sharing your findings with Babylonia.																						
45	45		104							0|150|-200	0																							
46	46		201							1	500533	3																						
47	47		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Bianca	Whew...	1																					
48	48		301									Finishing the call with Babylonia, Bianca lets out a little sigh. You can't be sure what's going through her mind at the moment, but she rarely ever does it.																						
49	49		302								So everything the expedition said is true.	50																						
50	50		204							1	1																							
51	51		301								Bianca	We've just had everything confirmed with Babylonia.	1																					
52	52		301								Bianca	But the higher-ups don't seem to think that we need to know anything about the message, and I'm guessing it's likely because it has to do with the Transatlantic Economic Community.	1																					
53	53		302								And that just makes the whole thing more fishy now.	54																						
54	54		301									Given that they put Bianca—the Purifying Force's ace—on the mission solely based on that one message from the past, one can't be blamed to wonder just how many secrets the now non-existent Transatlantic Economic Community used to hold.																						
55	55		301									But doing as told is your only option since you're in no position to ask any questions. Years of experience have taught you that knowing more than you should won't do you any good.																						
56	56		204							1	3																							
57	57		301								Bianca	We never saw any of that coming, but all in all, everything turned out just fine, though.	1																					
58	58		204							1	1																							
59	59		301								Bianca	And I'm glad to have you here, Commandant.	1																					
60	60		302								I didn't do anything, though?	61																						
61	61		204							1																								
62	62		301								Bianca	To be honest, I pretty much dropped the idea that they might be "defectors" or that they might have been "assaulted" before we even came to this port, judging by their attitudes and conditions.	1																					
63	63		301								Bianca	The thought that this whole thing might be a trap still lingered in the back of my mind, though... The nature of what we do as the Purifying Force makes it so that we can't count on our gut feelings.	1																					
64	64		204							1	1																							
65	65		301								Bianca	I'm sure the whole situation would have gotten out of control and ended with bloodshed hadn't you been here today, Commandant.	1																					
66	66		301									Lest we forget the door Bianca blew away—you were about to bring up the door but decided to drop it.																						
67	67		202							1					1																			
68	68		104							0|0|-200	10																							
69	69		301									In unison, you both turn to look at the bay in the distance.																						
70	70		301									The Constructs working around the icebreaker are still hard at work.																						
71	71		301									It's only been a few hours since you met them—but, looking at them now, you seem to share their enthusiasm.																						
72	72		301									You now share their cravings in wanting to see the ship back to the sea as soon as they can...																						
73	73		301									And toward that end, they carry on working away.																						
74	74		302								Would you say this trip was worth it?	75																						
75	75		201							1	500533	1																						
76	76		301							1	Bianca	Yes, of course.	1																					
77	77		301								Bianca	We wouldn't have had the chance to come here and see everything this place has to offer...	1																					
78	78		301								Bianca	Had Command never decided to send us here.	1																					
79	79		301								Bianca	And we found ourselves a "battlefield" we never knew about before, right?	1																					
80	80		302								Would have been great if we were here on vacation now, though.	81	I would have taken some time to look around if we weren't on a mission now.	81																				
81	81		301								Bianca	A lot of people came here for travels back in the Golden Age, though.	1																					
82	82		301								Bianca	Because there isn't anywhere quite like this on Earth.	1																					
83	83		301								Bianca	You can come here with the rest of Gray Raven when the command center assigns you your days off. I'm sure Management will say yes if you ask them.	1																					
84	84		302								Aren't you going to come with us?	85																						
85	85		204							1	7																							
86	86		301								Bianca	Me...?	1																					
87	87		204							1	8																							
88	88		301								Bianca	Schedule conflicts aside...	1																					
89	89		204							1	5																							
90	90		301								Bianca	Technically, being a member of the Purifying Force means that I'm in no position to have personal contact with the Task Force's Commandant.	1																					
91	91		204							1																								
92	92		301								Bianca	This mission itself is already an exception, and I can only imagine there being even fewer contacts between us down the road.	1																					
93	93		202							1					1																			
94	94		201							1	500019																							
95	95		301							1	Expedition Member A	Hey, guys!	1																					
96	96		301									One of the expedition members who came from the research station with you comes running this way.																						
97	97		301								Expedition Member A	So? Have you had everything confirmed with Babylonia already?	1																					
98	98		302								We just filled them in on everything.	99																						
99	99		301								Expedition Member A	Apologies that you came all the way for... nothing? Uhh... How should I put this...	1																					
100	100		201							1	500533																							
101	101		301							1	Bianca	That's fine. We're glad to see all of you doing just fine here.	1																					
102	102		204							1	3																							
103	103		301								Bianca	The Logistics Department does have quite some work to do to get us back to Babylonia... but I'm just glad that we didn't need to "purify" anyone or anything here.	1																					
104	104		204							1	8																							
105	105		301								Bianca	On the expenditure of deploying the transport craft multiple times... I'll give an explanation in the report when I'm back.	1																					
106	106		201							1	500019																							
107	107		301							1	Expedition Member A	Speaking of which, we do have a huge favor to ask of both of you.	1																					
108	108		301									Rubbing his hands, the man looks imploringly at both of you.																						
109	109		301								Expedition Member A	So... a few of our men who insisted on staying on the icebreaker to carry on with repair works ended up with some damage to their frames because of the snowstorm... See, a lot of us are of an older version.	1																					
110	110		301								Expedition Member A	And we're actually a bit tight on parts to fix them with here because we've put most of our resources into fixing the icebreaker, and it'd probably take about half a month to fix our men.	1																					
111	111		301								Expedition Member A	But we're also a bit tied down by all the observational work we need to do these days—which is what we were sent here to do in the first place—in addition to bringing the ship back to life, because we're going through Antarctica's active phase of life forms here.	1																					
112	112		301								Expedition Member A	So I was wondering if you could lend us a hand if you aren't in a hurry to leave.	1																					
113	113		201							1	500533	7																						
114	114		301							1	Bianca	As in... you want both of us to help you with your observational work?	1																					
115	115		301									With the mission ending way ahead of schedule, you now have no choice but to request an emergency pick-up if you want to return to Babylonia immediately.																						
116	116		301									If you accept the proposal just now, however, you and Bianca would be able to take advantage of however much time you have left until you're picked up.																						
117	117		302								Sounds like a plan, no?	118																						
118	118		204							1																								
119	119		301								Bianca	Pardon me...?	1																					
120	120		302								Hold on. Let me send in a mission request for that first.	121																						
121	121		202							1					1																			
122	122		301									Without waiting for Bianca's response, you pull out your communication device and send the command center a mission request.																						
123	123		301									A few moments later, you get a positive response from the command center stating that you and Bianca can hop on the next resource transport craft that comes to Antarctica.																						
124	124		302								We'll be happy to help as non-regular members until the next transport craft comes.	125																						
125	125		302								What do you say, Bianca?	126																						
126	126		201							1	500533	8																						
127	127		301							1	Bianca	There is only so much we can do, though, given our lack of professional knowledge.	1																					
128	128		204							1	3																							
129	129		301								Bianca	But if you're fine with that, we'll definitely be more than happy to help.	1																					
130	130		201							1	500019																							
131	131		301							1	Expedition Member A	Really? Oh boy, this is definitely a pleasant surprise. Thank you both so much!	1																					
132	132		302								That's one point for me, Bianca.	133																						
133	133		201							1	500533	3																						
134	134		301							1	Bianca	I see what you did there, Commandant.	1																					
135	135		301									Rarely, Bianca puts her arms across her chest, mocking you.																						
136	136		302								My bad...	137																						
137	137		201							1	500019																							
138	138		301							1	Expedition Member A	Hey, why don't you both come on board for a look with us?	1																					
139	139		301								Expedition Member A	We're setting sail soon.	1																					
140	140		302								Already?	141																						
141	141		301								Expedition Member A	Yes. This ship wasn't terribly damaged to begin with, and we've all been working around the clock to get it back to life. Our Engineering Force just told us that the ship is ready to hit the sea again.	1																					
142	142		301								Expedition Member A	The ship is far from being able to go all the way out, though. It's just going to be a sea trial for today, but we thought it'd make for a wonderful experience all the same, and we thought we'd invite the two of you onboard since you literally don't get to come to Antarctica every day!	1																					
143	143		302								Yes.	144	Shall we, Bianca?	146																				
144	144		201							1	500533	1																						
145	145	148	301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Bianca	Sure. Let's go, Commandant.	1

151	151		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The icebreaker sets sail.																						
152	152		301									Finishing your conversation with the Captain and walking up the deck, you see Bianca standing alone at the bow staring into the distance.																						
153	153		301									Compared to the Nighter—which you once took—this icebreaker may seem like a lone leaf in the sea.																						
154	154		301									What views you're seeing now, however, definitely can't be replicated anywhere else.																						
155	155		201							1	500533	1																						
156	156		301							1	Bianca	Commandant.	1																					
157	157		301									Bianca turns to nod at you as she notices you.																						
158	158		302								They seem to have come up with a new name for this ship...	159																						
159	159		302								"Lanternlighter", they say.	160																						
160	160		204							1	3

162	162		204							1	7																							
163	163		301								Bianca	Short and sweet, and the name suits the expedition just fine, too... because they literally are looking for new possibilities of the world still...	1																					
164	164		301									Bianca stops in her tracks before finishing her sentence.																						
165	165		301									Apparently having noticed something, she looks down at her waist.																						
166	166		301									The lantern-shaped Phantom Tracer she carries has been quiet since you arrived in Antarctica.																						
167	167		302								It's exactly what you think it is.	168																						
168	168		204							1																								
169	169		301								Bianca	It isn't exactly a lantern, but... I was still hoping you could tell me why, if you don't mind.	1																					
170	170		302								Didn't you just say it suits them?	171																						
171	171		204							1	8																							
172	172		301								Bianca	...If it's meant to be something symbolic, then I think it's better if they take it more seriously.	1																					
173	173		302								I believe this is a decision of deliberation, though	174																						
174	174		204							1																								
175	175		301								Bianca	I don't exactly understand why they did this...	1																					
176	176		204							1	3																							
177	177		301								Bianca	But I'm not going to ask any questions if this is what they want.	1																					
178	178		302								It's probably because they see something in you that reminds them of themselves.	179	They probably know about all the great things you've done.	182																				
179	179		204							1																								
180	180		301								Bianca	I don't know if they'd still see the same if they ever saw the Purifying Force in action.	1																					
181	181		302								One's true colors only show when they're off duty, though.	184																						
182	182		301									Bianca was key at the full-blown battle that took place at the aquarium a while back.																						
183	183		301									And who knows—some from Babylonia might have already seen past Bianca's icy facade and now see her for the heroine she is.																						
184	184		204							1	8																							
185	185		301								Bianca	Is that so...	1																					
186	186		204							1																								
187	187		301								Bianca	I don't deserve to be remembered or learned from...	1																					
188	188		301								Bianca	Well, I guess I should say I don't need people to remember the path I've chosen.	1																					
189	189		204							1	8																							
190	190		301								Bianca	But this sure is curious...	1																					
191	191		301								Bianca	I mean, I thought I was going to have an epiphany when a moment like this did come.	1																					
192	192		204							1	3

202	202		204							1																								
203	203		301								Bianca	It seems very different from your usual camera, though. Do you know how it works, Commandant?	1																					
204	204		302								They were teaching me how to use it just now.	205																						
205	205		302								Because I'm about to take a picture of my very first object now.	206

211	211		301									The iceberg is newfound, and it would have taken the expedition many more years to come across it without this icebreaker.																						
212	212		301									And now, they're dedicating this precious moment to you and Bianca.																						
213	213		301									With the camera in hand, you're now recording the very first discovery—which is but one single gem among the many Antarctica still holds—Lanternlighter has made on its maiden voyage.																						
214	214		301									The dignity of the movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water—once said by a famous author, this line is probably now common sense to everyone.																						
215	215		301									Still, with the view right in front of you—that is, only one-eighth of something so unimaginably gigantic...																						
216	216		301									You just can't help but think about what the remaining seven-eighth hidden under the water must look like.
