3	3		301			DialogEnable						Central Command — Outside the Training Operations Hall																						
4	4		301									After routine firearm training, you rub your wrists, now slightly numb from holding a gun for so long, and open the tactical terminal to confirm your next destination.																						
5	5		301									Walking to the corner of the hall, you bump into an unexpected person.																						
6	6		201							1	500328																							
7	7		301							1	No. 21	【kuroname】.	1																					
8	8		302								No. 21?	9	What are you doing here?	9																				
9	9		301								No. 21	I smelled something familiar, so I came to look for it.	1																					
10	10		302								What'd it smell like?	11																						
11	11		301								No. 21	Like this.	1																					
12	12		202							1					1																			
13	13		301									No. 21 rummages through her pocket, takes out a somewhat dirty object, then raises her hand up toward you.																						
14	14		301									A broken nameplate rests in the palm of her hand.																						
15	15		301									It's the same nameplate No. 21 had discovered earlier. You're surprised to see that she had taken it with her.																						
16	16		302								You mean, you found the owner?	17																						
17	17		301									No. 21 nods, then shakes her head.																						
18	18		201							1	500328																							
19	19		301							1	No. 21	They smell similar, but it's not the same person.	1																					
20	20		301				DialogDisable				No. 21	There's only a subtle difference, but I can tell. They're from the same team.	1																					
21	21		302								That's some nose you got there...	22																						
22	22		302								If that's the case, you should return it to its rightful owner.	23																						
23	23		301			DialogEnable					No. 21	How?	1																					
24	24		302								Find the Construct and give it back.	25																						
25	25		301								No. 21	Why?	1																					
26	26		302								Because it might be important to them.	27																						
27	27		301				DialogDisable				No. 21	Why would it be important?	1																					
28	28		302								Well...	29																						
29	29		302								You might find out if you return it to them.	30																						
30	30		301			DialogEnable	AniZhuanchangBegin				No. 21	Alright. I want to know.	1

33	33		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						No. 21 walks around the Task Force base like a small animal foraging for food, then finally stops at the door to Nighthawk's break room.																						
34	34		302								(Knock)	35																						
35	35		301									A young Construct looking at his tactical terminal notices the strange visitor. He scratches his head in doubt.																						
36	36		201							1	500019																							
37	37		301							1	Construct	...Who are you?	1																					
38	38		302								We're here to give this back.	39	(Looks at No. 21)	41																				
39	39		202							1					1																			
40	40	45	301									Following this, No. 21 holds up the nameplate.																						
41	41		201							1	500328																							
42	42		301							1	No. 21	...We found this in battle.	1																					
43	43		301								No. 21	It's "something important," so I wanted to bring it back.	1																					
44	44		202							1					1																			
45	45		201							1	500019																							
46	46		301							1	Construct	That nameplate... Ah! T-that's... Reynold's!																						
47	47		202							1					1																			
48	48		301									Seeing the thing in No. 21's hand, the Construct jumps out of his chair and rushes over. The chair makes a loud screech as it lurches back.																						
49	49		201							1	500328		-450																					
50	50		201							2	500019		450																					
51	51		301							1	Construct	How did you find that? What about Reynold? He's been missing since the last battle. I thought...	2																					
52	52		301								No. 21	This is all I found.	1																					
53	53		301								Construct	...R-really?	2																					
54	54		202							1	2				1																			
55	55		301									As if the last ounce of hope the Construct had clung to while waiting had vanished, he holds the nameplate firmly in his hands, falls to his knees, then begins to sob.																						
56	56		201							1	500328																							
57	57		301							1	No. 21	...	1																					
58	58		301								No. 21	This expression... Seems like you have lost something important.	1																					
59	59		202							1					1																			
60	60		301									No. 21 awkwardly holds her hands at her chest. The Co-Bot seems to share her bewilderment and runs around in circles.																						
61	61		301									No. 21 looks at you in hesitation.																						
62	62		301									After some time, she kneels down before the Construct as if suddenly thinking of something...																						
63	63		201							1	500328	2	-450																					
64	64		201							2	500019		450																					
65	65		301							1	No. 21	D-don't... cry...	1																					
66	66		301									As she tries to comfort him clumsily, her face distorts into an awkward, indescribable expression.																						
67	67		301									It appears to be a disastrous attempt at a "smile." All you can see is No. 21 try to force the corners of her mouth up in a vague crescent.																						
68	68		301								Construct	...	2																					
69	69		302								(Oh boy...)	70																						
70	70		301								Construct	W-what's... with that look on your face?	2																					
71	71		204							1																								
72	72		301								Construct	Do you think losing a comrade is funny?!	2																					
73	73		301								Construct	Oh, right... That symbol. You're with Cerberus, aren't you? I heard you all are a bunch of freaks!	2																					
74	74		301									The flustered Construct stands up and points at you.																						
75	75		301								Construct	Are you Cerberus' commandant? Shouldn't you keep your teammates in line?	2																					
76	76		301								Construct	Or... Are you just here to get a kick out of our misery?!	2																					
77	77		302								No...	78	That's not why we're here...	78																				
78	78		301								Construct	You cold-blooded monsters... No wonder you're on the same team.	2																					
79	79		301								Construct	You're not welcome here. Please leave.	2																					
80	80		202							1	2				1																			
81	81		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The Construct wipes his face on his sleeve, then pushes you and No. 21 out.

84	84		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The door slams in your face with a loud "BANG!"																						
85	85		301									No. 21 looks disappointed as she walks down the corridor.																						
86	86		302								Are you okay?	87																						
87	87		201							1	500328																							
88	88		301							1	No. 21	My frame is operating at 100%.	1																					
89	89		302								Why did you smile?	90	Were you trying to comfort him?	90																				
90	90		301								No. 21	He lost something important. He was "sad."	1																					
91	91		301								No. 21	I wanted to "comfort" him.	1																					
92	92		301								No. 21	I've learned from the speaking terminal that "smiling" is a kind expression. So I deduced that this was the appropriate time to "smile."	1																					
93	93		301								No. 21	That's what you would do, Commandant.	1																					
94	94		301								No. 21	When you smile, Commandant, I feel warm here.	1																					
95	95		301									She points to her chest.																						
96	96		301								No. 21	I am learning how to converse with humans.	1																					
97	97		301								No. 21	But when I "smile," everyone is afraid.	1																					
98	98		301								No. 21	When I would smile in battle, the enemy was afraid. That's what Vera and Noctis did as well.	1																					
99	99		301								No. 21	Later, I learned that smiling can be "kind."	1																					
100	100		301								No. 21	But... I failed. My smile only makes people afraid.	1																					
101	101		301									Recalling Vera and Noctis' behavior, you instantly realize why No. 21 smiled like this.																						
102	102		301									If she wants to learn how to talk with humans, Vera and Noctis aren't ideal teachers.																						
103	103		301								No. 21	...Is it because I have no emotions?	1																					
104	104		301				DialogDisable				No. 21	I can only "imitate." Is that wrong?	1																					
105	105		302								No, of course not.	106																						
106	106		302								It's just that, everyone has their own way of expressing emotions.	107																						
107	107		301			DialogEnable	DialogDisable				No. 21	Hmm...	1																					
108	108		302								"Smiling" has a lot of different meanings.	109																						
109	109		302								But it's often a sign of happiness.	110																						
110	110		301			DialogEnable					No. 21	...I don't understand. I don't have my own emotions.	1																					
111	111		301								No. 21	I only have the "emotions" of others in here.	1																					
112	112		301									No. 21 points at her head.																						
113	113		301								No. 21	But now they are gone.	1																					
114	114		301								No. 21	I don't know what I should do.	1																					
115	115		301				DialogDisable				No. 21	But now I know not to do that when someone is sad.	1																					
116	116		302								(Nods)	117																						
117	117		302								Next time you run into him...	118																						
118	118		302								Just say you're sorry.	119																						
119	119		302								In your own way.	120																						
120	120		301		1	DialogEnable	AniZhuanchangBegin				No. 21	Understood.	1
