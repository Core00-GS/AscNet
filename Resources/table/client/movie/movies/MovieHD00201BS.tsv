5	5		301							1	Asimov	Took you long enough to get here. Is the rest of your team as lazy as you are now?	1																					
6	6		302								So what's the matter?	7	I'm here right on time.	8																				
7	7	9	301								Asimov	Dodging the question, are we?	1																					
8	8		301								Asimov	Anyway, punctuality isn't the issue. It's your team's enthusiasm.	1																					
9	9		301								Asimov	Forget it. There are more important matters.	1																					
10	10		301								Asimov	Since you led your team while conducting the space station operation...	1																					
11	11		301								Asimov	After evaluating the threat of such an operation, the Science Council has decided to implement a new safety measure to avoid a similar situation from happening again.	1																					
12	12		301								Asimov	My research team has developed a combat simulator for emulating ideal combat scenarios based on the environmental data and team data collected thus far.	1																					
13	13		301								Asimov	I've named it "Project Babel Tower".	1																					
14	14		301								Asimov	I believe you've already participated in the first phase of the experiment.	1																					
15	15		301								Asimov	As far as the combat data report is concerned, I'm grateful for the contributions from each team involved.	1																					
16	16		301								Asimov	But as I've already made myself clear, this plan will be a long-term measure.	1																					
17	17		301								Asimov	Based on the previous combat report, I've made some minor enhancements and adjustments to the device.	1																					
18	18		301								Asimov	Also, I've integrated some environmental elements from the recent desert region.	1																					
19	19		301								Asimov	As always, give it everything you got so Command has more useful combat data to analyze and reference.	1																					
20	20		302								Got it.	21	Are we getting paid?	22																				
21	21	23	301								Asimov	Providing combat data for more difficult scenarios will be beneficial for each squad going forward.	1																					
22	22		301								Asimov	Looks like someone needs to learn a thing or two about manners. That being said, Command will provide you with supplies.	1																					
23	23		301								Asimov	That about wraps it up. Enough wasting time. Now go make yourself useful.	1																					
24	24		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Asimov	Remember... More effective battle reports from higher levels will be of greater value.	1
