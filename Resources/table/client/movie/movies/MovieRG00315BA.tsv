16	15		301							1	King	No, but I have more important things to do.	1																					
17	16		301								King	Anyway, I'd like to welcome you all, heroes from afar.	1

20	19		301							1	Lee	Welcome?	2																					
21	20		301									Hassen greeted three of them inside the ruins. He was polite and confident, totally ignoring that he was hiding just moments ago.																						
22	21		201							2	500166		-400																					
23	22		301							1	Lucia	Hassen... No, you must be the King.	2																					
24	23		301								King	Correct. You have finally come after so long, heroes from afar.	1																					
25	24		301								King	The war with the Demons has come to the most crucial moment. Our Princess Liv was taken by the Demon King. To rescue her, you must defeat the four Demon Generals to open the gate of the Demon King's Castle.	1																					
26	25		301								Lucia	I'm not asking for a task. What exactly are you planning?	2																					
27	26		201							1	500173		400																					
28	27		301							1	Lee	Wait, Lucia!	1																					
29	28		301									Some gears were missing from the conversation, but Lucia and Hassen somehow continued talking. Lee was the first to notice the abnormality.																						
30	29		301								Lucia	What's wrong?	2																					
31	30		301								Lee	Open your menu. Look at our main quest...	1																					
32	31		301								Lucia	What? Could it be...	2																					
33	32		301									Kamui also noticed what Hassen was after. When Lucia also had her system menu open, everybody realized the team's main quest had been altered.																						
34	33		301									Main quest: Open the gate of the Demon King's Castle.																						
35	34		301								Lucia	What's going on...!?	2																					
36	35		301								Lee	Kamui, you should know what happened better. Is this some hidden rule?	1																					
37	36		202							1	2																							
38	37		201							1	1081001																							
39	38		301							1	Kamui	Yeah, it's probably a compulsory event. We can't turn down a main quest in the game.	1																					
40	39		301								Kamui	As long as we talk to the main NPC at certain location, we are guaranteed to get the quest... And this Hassen could well be that NPC...	1																					
41	40		201							1	500011																							
42	41		301							1	King	Correct. I waited a long time for you in my palace, but you never showed up. So I came here to trigger the quest for you.	1																					
43	42		203							1	0.25	400																						
44	43		201							2	500173		-400																					
45	44		301							1	Lee	Are you...different from the regular NPCs?	2																					
46	45		301								King	I am an "NPC", of course.	1																					
47	46		301									Hassen emphasized his identity as an NPC. However, his behaviors felt nothing like a game-controlled character. He sounded more like another player.																						
48	47		301								King	I know why you entered the game, and I know you want to win over the other team. Rest assured that I don't plan to stop what you are doing. I only want you to do what the heroes are supposed to do.	1																					
49	48		301								King	That is, to follow the King's main quest.	1																					
50	49		201							2	1081001		-400																					
51	50		301								Kamui	I have no idea what you are thinking, but at least I know you are one strange NPC.	2																					
52	51		301								Kamui	But do you really think we will listen to you and do what we don't want to? Don't forget you are also targeting Liv.	2																					
53	52		301								King	Because she is special. She is the only Holy Maiden chosen by the system.	1																					
54	53		201							2	500166		-400																					
55	54		301								Lucia	Are you saying Liv, as a player, was granted some special power?	2																					
56	55		301								King	Correct. And I just happen to need that power.	1																					
57	56		301								Lucia	That only gives us more reason to stop "Your Majesty".	2																					
58	57		301								King	Don't get me wrong, I have no intention to hurt you. I just want to get the thing I want, and control this world.	1																					
59	58		301								King	Once I am successful, you can also complete your quest, win the race, and return to your world happily.	1																					
60	59		301								King	But if you continue to waste your time and do nothing, the other team will probably win. Don't you think?	1																					
61	60		301								Lucia	...I have one more question. What are you going to do after taking control of this game world?	2																					
62	61		301								King	Well, I am worried that you may turn me down once I answer that question.	1																					
63	62		301								Lucia	Fine. Here's my answer to you. Lee! Kamui!	2																					
64	63		301								King	Looks like we have to fight no matter what.	1																					
65	64		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Lucia and team grabbed their weapons and charged toward the enemy with no HP bar.
