79	79		301									The guard shouts his final warning at the kid—one who's looking disdainfully back at him.																						
80	80		301								Noan	So you find it "normal" to hurt a handicapped person—while I'm "out of my mind" trying to stop you from doing that? Well, screw that!

120	120		301									Given the way things look now, however, it's likely that that's never going to happen.																						
121	121		301									It's exactly as what Shauna has said—the only thing that matters to their "master" is whether they can carry out their tasks. The souls lost, the lives sacrificed, and all the futures nipped in the bud mean absolutely nothing to them.																						
122	122		301									Their "master" might punish these people for what happened today in whichever way they find most pleasing—yet the guard himself is the one that's going to take the sizzling heat that's about to come his way in the next few moments.

227	227		204							2	3																							
228	228		301								Noan	I'm sorry, Captain, for everything I've done.	2																					
229	229		204							2	5																							
230	230		301								Noan	But I'm only apologizing because of you, and it's got nothing to do with that guard.	2																					
231	231		301									Hearing Noan's words, Rachel lets out a long sigh.																						
232	232		301								Rachel	Boy, you seriously remind me of Julie.	1																					
233	233		204							2																								
234	234		301								Noan	My Mom...?	2																					
235	235		301								Noan	Would she do the same?	2																					
236	236		301								Rachel	Oh, she would, son, she would—and this only accounts for 20%.	1																					
237	237		301									Rachel nods her head.																						
238	238		301								Rachel	I mean things like this only account for 20% of why she always rubbed people the wrong way.	1																					
239	239		301								Noan	But she always said...	2																					
240	240		301								Rachel	Let me guess. It's either, "You just need to compromise," or, "You need to know how powerless you are," yeah?	1																					
241	241		301								Noan	Exactly.	2																					
242	242		301								Rachel	She's right.	1																					
243	243		301								Rachel	And I want you to promise me right now that you're never getting yourself into petty trouble like this ever again.	1																					
244	244		301								Noan	...But it was no petty trouble. Field was in no condition to get beaten up like that, and he really could have died if I hadn't butted in.	2																					
245	245		301								Rachel	Did you even think about the consequences? Do you really think those guards are just going to swallow that? No, they aren't. They are just going to make sure everyone suffers.	1																					
246	246		204							2	3																							
247	247		301								Noan	...I'm sorry.	2																					
248	248		301								Rachel	I'm not going to punish you or hold you responsible this time, though, because the guy is a fake.	1																					
249	249		204							2	7																							
250	250		301								Noan	...The guy is a what?	2																					
251	251		204							2																								
252	252		301								Rachel	The train is a big, messy pot with all the people we have onboard, and people just don't have the time to get to know one another. This holds true for the guards, too, and it isn't the first time they find a fake among themselves.	1																					
253	253		301								Rachel	You can't really see their faces once they have that protective suit on—which is why some wannabes try to get their hands on the suit. They just want the perks that come with it.	1																					
254	254		301								Noan	...That's unheard of.	2																					
255	255		301								Rachel	Don't worry. I will bring this to the aristocrats' attention and ask them to look into it.	1																					
256	256		301								Noan	Are you connected... to the aristocrats?	2																					
257	257		301								Rachel	Like it or not, the Cargo Crew has to keep them updated on our missions. It's nothing you need to worry about, though.	1																					
258	258		301								Rachel	But get this... this will not happen again.	1																					
259	259		301								Rachel	You'll be as good as dead if you play with fire again and run into a real guard next time.	1																					
260	260		301								Noan	Well...	2																					
261	261		301								Noan	The fake that tried to give me a hard time wouldn't have picked on me if he were a real guard, though.	2																					
262	262		301								Rachel	Are you trying to say that you weren't just playing with fire and that what you did was a calculated move?	1																					
263	263		301								Noan	That's exactly what I'm saying, Captain. I wasn't playing with fire, and I'm not the same hot-tempered kid that I was before.	2																					
264	264		301								Rachel	Wait, what? So you're saying that you've thought it all through and that you're gonna butt in again if you come across scenes like that?	1																					
265	265		301									Rachel lets out another sigh.																						
266	266		301								Rachel	Noan, let's just get real. Know who you are and learn to compromise—it's all meant to keep yourself safe, as Julie said.	1																					
267	267		301								Noan	...	2																					
268	268		204							2	5																							
269	269		301								Noan	But people are just going to die like my mom if I compromise, no? Even if she really did a lot of terrible things, they should have punished her with the "law" that the royal guards talk about.	2																					
270	270		301								Noan	But no, they just poisoned and killed her, and we don't even know who did that.	2																					
271	271		301								Noan	Who are we to say they'll spare us when they can get away with killing people and hurting people like Field?	2																					
272	272		301								Rachel	...	1																					
273	273		301									Rachel looks up to study Noan's still somewhat immature face.																						
274	274		301									And that's when it hits her—that what he did was not a temper-driven move, and that he knew exactly what he was doing, as he said.																						
275	275		204							2																								
276	276		301								Rachel	I'm sorry, but I guess I should have made myself more clear. I do want you to compromise, but I never asked you to give up altogether.	1																					
277	277		301								Rachel	We're no heroes, which is why we need to find a smarter way to cope with these things.	1																					
278	278		301								Rachel	I know you're angry, son, but we need to wait for that right moment to strike.	1																					
279	279		301								Noan	...Okay.	2																					
280	280		301								Rachel	Just give it some more time, Noan.	1																					
281	281		301								Rachel	I can assure you that I don't hate those bastards any less than you do.	1

292	292		301									Field looks at Noan in disbelief.																						
293	293		301								Noan	Doesn't that happen in the world out there, too?	2																					
294	294		301								Field	Well... this never happened in the reservation area I was at, at least.	1																					
295	295		301								Noan	I heard they only take in qualified skilled workers, and the screening is super hard, too.	2																					
296	296		301								Field	...Yes, those are true. I mean, because the reservation area only has so much space.	1																					
297	297		301									Field looks up at the dim light up above with those green eyes of his.																						
298	298		204							1	14																							
299	299		301								Field	...Three years ago, someone hurt his fellow applicants because he wanted to pass the screening very badly.	1																					
300	300		301								Field	When some of the Constructs guarding our reservation area caught him, he had sores all over his body from Punishing... and it was so bad that he probably wouldn't last longer than a few days.	1																					
301	301		301								Field	Except none of us wanted to take him in because of what he'd done. One of the Constructs gave him a serum because he couldn't stand seeing him on the verge of dying.	1																					
302	302		301								Field	But then... he gave the serum back to us the day after and died.	1																					
303	303		204							1																								
304	304		301								Noan	Why, though?	2																					
305	305		204							1	14																							
306	306		301								Field	Because a single serum wouldn't change his fate... or so my dad said.	1																					
307	307		301								Noan	...Is that what the world out there is like?	2																					
308	308		204							1																								
309	309		301								Field	Yes. The screening is challenging enough that it helps uphold the order within the walls—but it's also the very thing that makes it impossible for us to save those in need.	1																					
310	310		301								Field	Which... is why I had my hopes up before I got here. My dad told me that ACA's screening isn't as difficult, which makes it a moving utopia that's immune to the Punishing Virus and brings supplies and smiles to people in need all over the world.	1																					
311	311		301								Noan	Did you just say your dad called this place a "utopia"?	2																					
312	312		301								Field	Yes, but little did he know, eh...?	1																					
313	313		301								Field	What happened to this place, though? Or has it always been like this?	1																					
314	314		301								Noan	...Well...	2

375	375		301								Cargo Captain Shauna	Julie was the one that never let him out. She thought the world out here is much too dangerous and might kill him.	1
