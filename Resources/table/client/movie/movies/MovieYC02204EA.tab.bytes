7	7		301								"Beardy"	Did... Did we lose them?	1																					
8	8		301								Kordes	Looks like it... I don't see any behind us.	2																					
9	9		301									After running for a long time, the forest and monsters are finally gone‚Äîat least for the time being. The Scavengers stand in a clearing. The tall steel buildings in the distance block most of the sunlight in front of them, casting heavy shadows on the field.

11	11		301									The Central Purification Filters were a form of hope that people in the Post-Pandemic Age lived on. Now they're lighthouses that lead Babylonia to recapture Earth. Several conservation areas have been built around the filter towers, carrying the hopes of many that still wander on Earth.																						
12	12		301									The facilities at the base of the tower are entwined by mysterious vines. Even after standing in the wind and rain for decades, the white paint on the tower still remains clearly visible.																						
13	13		301									"C.P.F. 040"																						
14	14		201							1	500136																							
15	15		301							1	Zack	..." Central Purification Filter 040". We made it.	1																					
16	16		301									Zack cannot help but take another two steps forward. Only by looking up, can he see the tower in its entirety. The red light at top of the tower looms in the gray sky.																						
17	17		301								Zack	Looks like the tower...	1

19	19		201							2	500140		400																					
20	20		301							1	"Beardy"	Wait... Where'd that bastard go?	2																					
21	21		301									"Beardy's" loud outburst echoes in the clearing, startling Zack, who has been looking at the tower in contemplation.																						
22	22		301								Zack	Are you trying to give our position away to all those monsters?	1																					
23	23		301								"Beardy"	No... Our guide's missing.	2																					
24	24		301								Zack	Rolmo?	1

26	26		201							1	500139																							
27	27		301							1	Kordes	Looks like we got separated when we ran away.	1																					
28	28		201							1	500140																							
29	29		301							1	"Beardy"	Looks like he's a goner... He could barely stand on his feet. Guess those monsters tore him to pieces.	1																					
30	30		401							2	1516																							
31	31		301									As soon as "Beardy" speaks, they hear a rustling of branches and footsteps coming from the forest as if something is approaching.																						
32	32		202							1	2				1																			
33	33		301									Zack immediately raises his gun and points it in the direction of the noise. The tension in the air causes the trio to freeze.																						
34	34		301									The bushes shake, then a dirty gray figure emerges from within. He raised his hands in horror when he sees the barrels of guns pointing right at him.																						
35	35		201							1	500384																							
36	36		301							1	Rolmo	It's me! D-don't shoot!	1																					
37	37		201							1	500136																							
38	38		301							1	Zack	...	1																					
39	39		201							1	500140																							
40	40		301							1	"Beardy"	Holy crap. You made it out alive. I thought you were...	1																					
41	41		201							1	500384																							
42	42		301							1	Rolmo	I know the forest like the back of my hand, so...	1																					
43	43		202							1					1																			
44	44		301							1		Zack's gun still remains firmly trained on the compliant refugee even though the crisis has been averted.	1																					
45	45		201							1	500136																							
46	46		301							1	Zack	Were those the monsters you were referring to?	1																					
47	47		201							1	500384																							
48	48		301							1	Rolmo	Y-yeah... I warned you guys! Didn't I?!	1																					
49	49		301									Rolmo nods in panic, as if the men's guns are more frightening than those monsters. He carefully observes Zack's expression and adds in a low voice.																						
50	50		301								Rolmo	I normally don't encounter them the way I go. And if I do, they just crawl around and don't attack. I've never seen so many...	1																					
51	51		201							1	500136																							
52	52		301							1	Zack	...Do you know where the entrance to the CPF is?	1																					
53	53		201							1	500384																							
54	54		301							1	Rolmo	Y-yeah, I do. The front door won't open though. We have to go in through an air vent.	1																					
55	55		301								Rolmo	Hurry, let's go in. Those monsters are swarming the outside of the tower...	1																					
56	56		201							1	500136																							
57	57		301							1	Zack	Hear that? We're all here. Let's go.	1																					
58	58		201							1	500140																							
59	59		301							1	"Beardy"	Lead the way, Mr. Guide.	1																					
60	60		301									Beardy smiles and raises his hand to pat Rolmo on the shoulder, but Rolmo flinches with a frightened expression.																						
61	61		301								"Beardy"	What's the matter? I'm not gonna hit you... Forget it.	1																					
62	62		301									"Beardy" shrugs and turns to look at the filter tower in front of him.																						
63	63		301								"Beardy"	That tower sure is tall...	1																					
64	64		301								"Beardy"	Hey, Kordes, we're like the protagonist in that movie Zack likes, aren't we? Going through that damn forest and encountering those damn monsters in search of something that might not even exist in this damn tower.	1																					
65	65		201							1	500136		400																					
66	66		201							2	500139		-400																					
67	67		301							1	Zack	...	1																					
68	68		301									Zack remains quiet and sighs.																						
69	69		301								Kordes	No way we're the protagonists. The protagonists are out saving the world. No one cares about our story. Even a B-rated movie might be better than our current lives.	2																					
70	70		301								Zack	But at least some people will see us fighting to survive.	1																					
71	71		202							1	2				1

73	73		301							1	Rolmo	...	1																					
74	74		202							1					1																			
75	75		301									The Scavengers gradually approach the CPF in silence.																						
76	76		301									At this time, none of them are aware that they stepped foot onto a stage‚Äîa stage for a "performance" that has been planned long in advance.																						
77	77		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					The only "spectator" is gazing from the chaos deep inside the tower, through the winding vines that entangle the forest, and the vacant eyes of the Hetero-Creatures.
