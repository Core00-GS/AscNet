4	4		301									The rooms in the base are designed like a beehive.																						
5	5		301									Looking up from the corridor, Lustrous sees two "cliffs" full of shiny blocks, like frost flowers on giant glass.																						
6	6		301									Every block is either a lab or a research room. Many people in white lab coats walk on the corridors, looking no different from worker bees without wings.																						
7	7		301									Tens of thousands of drones hum around them, taking care of everything in the base under the management of the logistics department.																						
8	8		301									They flow through the corridors, vents and electric cables to perform cleaning and maintenance, so the researchers can focus on the zero-point reactor.																						
9	9		301									The blinking signals of servers in the server room form a brilliant sea. The tall server cabinets look like solemn monuments, making the people working among them look like dust.																						
10	10		301									The researchers only care about their studies.																						
11	11		301									No matter where Lustrous goes, she can only hear discussions about physics and mathematics. The base is overflowed with a language formed by parameters, variables and equations.																						
12	12		301									But now there is a small variable.																						
13	13		301									Right, that foolish young human.																						
14	14		301									With a poker face, Lustrous walks up to the girl wandering in front of her door.

24	24		301								Lamia	Um, huh? Speak... what?	1

46	46		301								Lamia	Why?! The uncles over there are all very nice. Please don't blame them.	1																					
47	47		301								Lustrous	It's not up to you to decide. I was upset because they tried to cover up a trivial matter, which made me have to explain to you in person.	2

55	55		301								Lustrous	This is your mother. She gave birth to you.	2																					
56	56		301								Lamia	What is "give birth"?	1																					
57	57		301								Lustrous	To humans, it's a process in which sperms and an egg cell merge in a mother's uterus and develop into a fetus, which is eventually delivered by the mother.	2																					
58	58		301								Lamia	I... don't understand, ma'am.	1																					
59	59		301								Lustrous	To put it simple, she made you.	2

80	80		301								Lamia	My mom... Where is she now?	1																					
81	81		301								Lustrous	Do you mean her body? We buried her in the sea.	2
