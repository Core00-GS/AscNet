15	15		301							1	Liv	Commandant, I can try connecting to the M.I.N.D. of these Constructs...	1																					
16	16		301								Liv	If their memories are intact, we should be able to find some clues about the enemy.	1																					
17	17		302							200	Is that dangerous?	21	What can we do to help?	26

21	21		301							1	Lee	For normal Constructs, entering a possibly corrupted Construct's M.I.N.D. is, of course, highly dangerous.	3																					
22	22		301								Lee	But Liv is the newest Support-type model. Her analytical efficiency and safeguard against the virus are both of the highest caliber. The theoretical chance of corruption is extremely low.	3

25	25	35	301							1	Liv	And, with the Mind Beacon of our commandant as a safety measure, I'm sure it'll be fine.	1																					
26	26		301							1	Lee	Due to the complexity of the M.I.N.D. system, reading it would cause great strain for Livâ€”more taxing than fending against the virus. Liv may be the latest Support-type model, but she'd still need to halt most of her other functions when analyzing.	3

29	29		301							1	Lucia	So we will have to protect her while she's running an analysis.	2
