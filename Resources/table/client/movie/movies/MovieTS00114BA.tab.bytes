28	27		301								Bianca	That's not it. My target's not inside the Golden Vortex.	1																					
29	28		301								Bianca	We've set up a temporary base inside the desert‚Äîhere are the coordinates. I hope you can get yourself fixed up when you get there.	1

34	33		301								Bianca	But wiser as well. If you insist on operating in this state, not only will you hurt yourself, you'll endanger other squads as well.	1
