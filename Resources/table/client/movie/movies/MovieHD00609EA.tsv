21	21		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Celica	But... if that's the case, what could the School... possibly be up to?	1																					
22	22		301								Celica	It clearly wields great power and resources, but it hasn't unveiled its purpose to the world.	1																					
23	23		301								Celica	During Operation Acadia, around the outbreak of the Punishing Virus, the School had never showed up...	1																					
24	24		301								Hassen	Perhaps because they had already deemed the surface world as "failures."	2																					
25	25		301								Hassen	If the School regarded itself as an Ark, then it must be operating on the premise that the rest of the world will be destroyed by some kind of "flood."	2																					
26	26		301								Hassen	In other words, maybe the School went into hiding underground because they believed that the surface couldn't endure the coming disaster.	2																					
27	27		301								Celica	...They sure sound full of themselves.	1																					
28	28		301								Hassen	That may be true, but... judging from the Gray Ravens' intel, no humans have been found in the facility.	2																					
29	29		301								Celica	How is that possible? What about those that were identified as missing by the operation...?	1																					
30	30		301								Hassen	...There were at least hundreds of thousands of people. But so far, none of the footage sent by the Gray Ravens indicated any signs of life.	2																					
31	31		301								Celica	Are they hiding?	1																					
32	32		301								Hassen	They aren't stupid. They should know that there would be no use hiding if someone has infiltrated their facility.	2																					
33	33		301								Hassen	Could it be that something happened in the facility...?	2																					
34	34		301								Hassen	But we still haven't reestablished contact with Gray Raven. It means that they still haven't returned from the depths of the underground facility to an area where they can communicate.	2																					
35	35		301								Celica	...Let's just wait and see. Isn't that what you told me?	1																					
36	36		301								Celica	"Even if 【kuroname】 sees the darkness buried within this world, the commandant still manages to find one's own direction in life."	1																					
37	37		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Hassen	...You're right. Let's just wait to hear from the Gray Ravens.	2
