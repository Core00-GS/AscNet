9	7		301								Lee	Liv's not here, so we have limited data collection capabilities. Nothing to do now but to wait for Kamui.	3

18	16		301								Lucia	Sometimes in battle, I feel like it is Liv who stays in the back that shines the brightest.	2																					
19	17		301								Lucia	When I first became the leader of this squad, I might have chosen Liv because of that almost blinding and warm aura of hers.	2																					
20	18		301								Lee	If I remember correctly, Liv is the only one of us who's been awarded with an honorary medal of the highest rank.	3																					
21	19		301								Lee	I trust that, for someone like her, she'd know what to do in this situation.	3

31	29		301								Kamui	The entrance is quite small. You can divide the Corrupted there into two groups, one patrolling in and out the entrance, the other wandering randomly around the entrance outside.	1
