4	4		301			DialogEnable						The silence of the conference hall is broken by Hassen's footsteps.																						
5	5		301									He makes his way to the other end of the long cold desk and sits down, taking in the sight of this building with a history as old as Babylonia.																						
6	6		301									The huge conference hall is only filled by a few people, others are participating as holograms projected on their seats. The symbols of the Judicial Court, Executive Court, Control Court, and the military army makes this spacious hall appear to be even more solemn.																						
7	7		301									The pillars supporting the dome of the hall are all a record of history in the form of numerous name engravings. They were the ones who helped make the World Government possible.																						
8	8		301									History can be tasted in the solemn air.																						
9	9		301									The mark of the World Government which bears the hope of humanity appears at the top of the room with dignity. Another "World Government Conference" is about to start.

12	12		301									The topics for discussion appear as blue data flow in front of the seats.																						
13	13		301									From Operation Acadia long ago to the recent battle commands against the Ascendants, they are all included in the discussion topics.																						
14	14		301									The councilmen all understand that the topics that appear in the "World Government Summit" all bear grave importance to Babylonia or humanity.																						
15	15		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStory/FxUiStoryShuju.prefab																							
16	16		301									Each topic had been a crucial point in the history of humanity, a pivotal decision that shapes the future of Babylonia‚Äîall that sways the boat that is the history of humanity.																						
17	17		301									In comparison to that, topics brought up in the "World Government Conference" affect the world in a far lesser scale, which is why most participate in the form of a hologram.																						
18	18		301									The lights on the dome flicker off one by one, enshrouding the space in darkness.																						
19	19		301									It is as if a veil of ink has been deposited on the conference hall, blurring the lines of things.																						
20	20		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryTongxunNew.prefab	2																							
21	21		301									This dim space allows one to imagine themselves on an isolated island among the vast universe of darkness. Right after that, bits of light begin to illuminate the place like stars.																						
22	22		301									The stars‚Äîdata projections that appear on the screen between the pillars‚Äîcolor the "universe."																						
23	23		301									These stars are the "voices of the people."																						
24	24		301									Citizens of the World Government upload their thoughts through their personal terminals, which then converge into a huge data flow on Gestalt.

26	26		401							2	1509																							
27	27		401					50		2	1509																							
28	28		301									Gestalt runs at full efficiency to extract important data from this flow and summarize them into a simple display to project in the conference hall, allowing the councilmen to "hear" the voices of the people.																						
29	29		301									Hassen stands, wrapped in the light and announces the start of the conference.																						
30	30		201							1	500011																							
31	31		301							1	Hassen	First on the agenda‚Äîrecently, Akdilek proposed amendments to a treaty signed in the past, demanding us to provide more Helium-3. I would like to know your thoughts on this matter.	1

36	36		301								Councilman A	92% of the people think that for the stability of humanity, we should agree to our ally's demand if we have enough resources to spare.	1																					
37	37		301								Councilman B	However, 7% think that the treaties are sacred, agreeing to the amendments would diminish Babylonia's authority, and that if it happens once there will be a second time. They would just demand resources from us indefinitely and we'd lose the upper hand.	2																					
38	38		301								Councilman A	But don't forget it's thanks to Akdilek that we were able to resume our ground logistics and trades with the conservation area.	1																					
39	39		301								Councilman B	Those blood-sucking merchants are requesting to change the treaty now precisely because they know that. We'll just be walking into their trap.	2

43	43		301								???	To summarize, the Control Court is not in favor of agreeing to Akdilek's request.																						
44	44		301								???	Akdilek is an ally that can be negotiated with, as long as the content is realistic, there will be another chance for discussion.																						
45	45		301									A calm voice emits from behind the Control Court's symbol, interrupting the two councilmen's squabble.																						
46	46		201							1	500352																							
47	47		301							1		The speaker is a gray-haired woman, one of the few who were actually present in the conference hall. Time has mercilessly decorated her short hair with streaks of white and etched wrinkles on her face, but her sharp eyes remain determined.	1																					
48	48		301									Those pair of eyes have witnessed countless storms in the history of humanity, and it is exactly all that she has endured that allowed her to stay vigilant.	1																					
49	49		301									It may be exhausting to have to stay on edge at all times, but she still does it because she understands the duty of the Control Court‚Äîshe understands the responsibility one has to bear as the person in charge of said court.	1																					
50	50		301									She is the one who reins in those who stray and ensures that the conference does not endanger humanity.	1																					
51	51		201							1	500011																							
52	52		301							1	Hassen	Hmm... To sustain a friendly relationship while still being able to maintain authority. Voting regarding Congresswoman Hilda's proposal begins now.	1																					
53	53		301									Hassen presses the green button in front of him. The screen between the pillars shows a huge gauge panel. After a few seconds, Gestalt displays the result.																						
54	54		401							2	1515																							
55	55		201							1	500264																							
56	56		301							1	Gestalt	97.1% are in favor of Ombudswoman Hilda's proposal, 0.8% opposing votes, and 2.1% abstained. The supporting rate is higher than the minimum requirements. This proposal is passed.	1																					
57	57		201							1	500011																							
58	58		301								Hassen	Good. The Judicial Court will draft the new amendments and pass it on to the Control Court for filing. I'll sign it after the Diplomatic Court clears it.	1																					
59	59		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Hassen	Moving on to the second topic of the day‚ÄîNikola's proposal to expand the army...	1																					
60	60		401						1000	1	36																							
61	61		401							1	202																							
62	62		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Hassen	That is the last of the topics for discussion today, any questions?	1																					
63	63		202							1					1																			
64	64		301									The conference did not go on for long. This "well-oiled machine" operates at maximum capacity to lead humanity, going through discussions efficiently and solving problems in the way most appealing to the public.																						
65	65		301									A hologram of a congressman lights up at Hassen's question.

67	67		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryTongxunHalfNew.prefab		1																						
68	68		301							1	Councilman C	Mr. President, this isn't a question regarding any of the topics discussed but a personal question.	1																					
69	69		301								Councilman C	About the return ceremony of „Äêkuroname„Äë from Atlantis, was it necessary for it to be so lavish?	1																					
70	70		301									A projection of a crowd appears in the middle of the conference hall.																						
71	71		301									It shows a crowd cheering with joyous expressions. One can feel the atmosphere of the event just by watching.																						
72	72		301								Councilman C	This one ceremony exhausted resources that could have sustained a small living area in Babylonia for three days. I don't see how it is logical to use up all those resources just to celebrate a soldier completing their mission and reuniting with their team.	1																					
73	73		203							1	0.25	400																						
74	74		201							2	500011		-400																					
75	75		301							1	Hassen	They fought off the Ascendant Lamia and brought the hope of Atlantis back to Babylonia. It can be said that it was a historic moment in the advancement of science.	2																					
76	76		301								Hassen	A lot of citizens volunteered to participate in the ceremony, which naturally leads to more resources being exhausted.	2																					
77	77		301								Hassen	Adding in all that „Äêkuroname„Äë has achieved on land, of course people would want to celebrate the return of a hero.	2																					
78	78		301									Hassen motions toward the holographic crowd.																						
79	79		301									The crowd dims, finally leaving only the Gray Raven visible.																						
80	80		301								Councilman C	But it's been a while since we've paraded a whole team of Constructs in front of the public for them to worship.	1																					
81	81		301								Councilman C	Wouldn't a whole team be harder to control compared to "The Undying Loy"?	1																					
82	82		301								Hassen	Yes, we know.	2																					
83	83		301								Hassen	But people are mentally strained from the constant war, they need something to rely on spiritually. They need hope.	2																					
84	84		301								Hassen	Hope is not something we can just make. It's something that exists because people wish for it.	2																					
85	85		301								Hassen	We are merely listening to the wants of the people.	2																					
86	86		301								Councilman C	Even if it's something as trivial as hope?	1																					
87	87		201							2	500352		-400																					
88	88		301							1	Hilda	Hope has never been something "trivial."	2																					
89	89		301								Hilda	Have you never read mythology, Congressman Fermi?	2																					
90	90		301								Councilman C	...What does mythology have to do with this?	1																					
91	91		301								Hilda	Aren't you curious as to why heroes were written in similar ways no matter the origin of the myths?	2																					
92	92		301								Hilda	Someone always loses their peaceful life, and has to go through numerous trials before returning triumphantly, basked in glory and praise.	2																					
93	93		301								Hilda	Under the guise of a hero is just a normal human, but people regard them as a champion equal to the gods nonetheless.	2																					
94	94		301								Hilda	It is because heroes inspire hope in people. And when there is enough hope, you can lead the people. But if you destroy hope, you become the enemy of the people.	2																					
95	95		301								Hilda	Which is why hope is never "trivial." IT can be one of the most powerful weapons if used correctly.	2																					
96	96		301								Hilda	I will leave the rest of the explanation to Commander Nikola.	2																					
97	97		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryTongxunHalfNew.prefab		1																					
98	98		202							1	2				1																			
99	99		301									As if on cue, Nikola looks up from the reports in his hand.																						
100	100		201							1	500012																							
101	101		301							1	Nikola	I'm sure everyone has noticed the frequent interferences Kurono has been causing recently.	1																					
102	102		301								Nikola	It was necessary to expose „Äêkuroname„Äë to the public in order to end these unsavory exchanges with them.	1																					
103	103		301								Nikola	It is to protect Gray Raven as much as to serve as a warning to Kurono.	1																					
104	104		301								Nikola	The public's attention is the best surveillance. Even Kurono cannot do as they please under constant public attention.	1																					
105	105		201							1	500352																							
106	106		301							1	Hilda	At least for now.	1																					
107	107		201							1	500012																							
108	108		301							1	Nikola	Which is why we have prepared a special mission for the newly reunited Gray Raven, in hopes of prolonging the temporary protection.	1																					
109	109		202							1					1																			
110	110		301									As the councilman reacts by staying silent, Hassen plasters on his usual smile.																						
111	111		401							2	1516																							
112	112		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					He claps to indicate the end of the conference. The holograms flicker out while the remaining councilmen filter out of the hall.																						
113	113		401						1000	1	36																							
114	114		401							1	211																							
115	115		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Soon, only Hassen, Nikola, and Hilda are left.																						
116	116		201							1	500011		400																					
117	117		201							2	500012		-400																					
118	118		301							1	Nikola	Kurono has eyes everywhere. There was no need to announce our objectives out loud for the whole world to see.	2																					
119	119		301								Hassen	It's fine. I'm certain Kurono already knows all this so it wouldn't have made a difference.	1																					
120	120		203							1	0.25	600																						
121	121		203							2	0.25	-600																						
122	122		201							3	500352																							
123	123		301							1	Hilda	And there's nothing they can do about it at the moment.	3																					
124	124		301								Hassen	Hah...	1																					
125	125		301								Hassen	It's been a while since the three of us had a chat.	1																					
126	126		301								Hilda	Private interactions can lead to unfair judgment. As the leader of the Control Court, I have to refrain from private meetings with you to remain fair.	3																					
127	127		301								Hilda	But there are exceptions, such as when discussing something as unique as what we are going to now.	3																					
128	128		301								Hassen	Shall we get on with it then?	1																					
129	129		301								Hassen	So what have the Control Court and the Science Council found out about the Omega File?	1																					
130	130		301								Hassen	Depending on the significance, we may have to prepare for a large-scale World Government Conference.	1																					
131	131		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Hilda	The conclusion is already on your terminals. I just sent it through the encrypted channel a second ago.	3
