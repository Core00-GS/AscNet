5	5		301							1	Gabriel	Roland, how are you feeling?	2																					
6	6		301								Roland	I must thank you. If it hadn't been for that thing you brought back, I wouldn't have improved so much.	1																					
7	7		301								Selena	……																						
8	8		301								Gabriel	Well, this is what Miss Luna has hoped for.	2

11	11		301							1	α	Just don't lose to the Babylonia people again.	1																					
12	12		201							1	500008																							
13	13		301							1	Roland	That's blunt. I will try.	1																					
14	14		202							1					1																			
15	15		301									The Ascendants are gathered in an empty church. Sunlight sneaks through the cracks in the walls and falls on their elegant figures.																						
16	16		301								? ? ?	That's it? You will try?																						
17	17		301									The church door slowly opens. Hearing the sound behind them, Roland and Gabriel stand to attention and salute. Alpha walks over to the door in a welcoming manner.																						
18	18		201							1	500105																							
19	19		301							1	Luna	So... is that all you have to say? You will try?	1																					
20	20		301									The owner of the voice, Luna, walks over and asks again, her manner brisk and passionless.																						
21	21		201							1	500008																							
22	22		301							1	Roland	Yes, Miss Luna, I will try.	1																					
23	23		301									Alpha furrows her eyebrows at Roland's answer. Gabriel shivers a little but quickly regains his calm.																						
24	24		301									—																						
25	25		201							1	500105	13																						
26	26		301							1	Luna	Mm, I will be watching.	1																					
27	27		201							1	500008																							
28	28		301							1	Roland	Thank you.	1																					
29	29		202							1					1																			
30	30		301									Luna's timely smile relaxes the tension before it escalates into something ugly. A certain someone feels relieved. Meanwhile, Roland and Gabriel finish their salute.																						
31	31		201							1	500101																							
32	32		301							1	Gabriel	Since Miss Luna is here, why don't you update us on the progress of your mission... Miss Lamia.	1																					
33	33		301								Gabriel	Miss Lamia?	1																					
34	34		202							1					1																			
35	35		301									Gabriel quickly moves on to the next topic, but this Lamia girl is unresponsive, as if she was somewhere else.																						
36	36		201							1	500100																							
37	37		301							1	α	I haven't seen her since I got here...	1																					
38	38		201							1	500008																							
39	39		301							1	Roland	You've been hiding here all along, have you, Lamia? Show up right now, or I'm gonna blow this place up.	1																					
40	40		301								? ? ?	Wait, wait, wait! Are you a devil!?																						
41	41		301								Roland	Not a devil, but an Ascendant. Now stop being invisible and show yourself!	1																					
42	42		301								Lamia	I'm here. Just lower your gun. I surrender!																						
43	43		202							1					1																			
44	44		301									Succumbing to Roland's threat, a monstrous feminine figure emerges from a dark corner. Despite her timid manner, she is actually an Ascendant working under Luna.

46	46		201							2	500165		400																					
47	47		301							1	Roland	I just want to remind you it's time to quit slacking and get back to work.	1																					
48	48		301								Lamia	I... I'm not slacking. I went to Akdilek and that disgusting ship... like I was told to.	2																					
49	49		301								Lamia	I went into invisibility... only because I don't like crowds...	2																					
50	50		301								Roland	Which is another way of saying "slacking off". So, you must have come into contact with certain people, right?	1																					
51	51		301								Lamia	Um... yeah.	2																					
52	52		301								Roland	...	1																					
53	53		202							1	2				1																			
54	54		201							1	500105																							
55	55		301							1	Luna	Anyway, the task I gave you, how did it go, Lamia?	1																					
56	56		202							1					1																			
57	57		301									Unfazed by the silly farce unfolding before her, Luna unhurriedly walks over to Lamia and asks.																						
58	58		201							1	500165																							
59	59		301							1	Lamia	Uh... about that... I think I failed.	1																					
60	60		301								Lamia	The leaders of Kowloong Corp refused to get on board with our plan, but neither would they be complicit in Babylonia's plot.	1																					
61	61		301								Lamia	They said they'd rather decide the future of Earth on their own, without meddling from anyone.	1																					
62	62		201							1	500100																							
63	63		301							1	α	How naive! Do they honestly think they can be neutral in a world like this?	1																					
64	64		201							1	500165																							
65	65		301							1	Lamia	So don't get mad at me. I'm just the messenger!	1																					
66	66		201							1	500105																							
67	67		301							1	Luna	My sister is not mad at you. She just can't understand their stupidity.	1																					
68	68		201							1	500165																							
69	69		301							1	Lamia	But can you understand it?	1																					
70	70		201							1	500105																							
71	71		301							1	Luna	Neither can I, of course.	1																					
72	72		201							1	500101																							
73	73		301							1	Gabriel	So, Miss Luna, does that mean...	1																					
74	74		201							1	500105																							
75	75		301							1	Luna	The power of Heteromers is under our control. Roland's frame has been enhanced. And most importantly, Babylonia is on its way to becoming a corporation.	1																					
76	76		301								Luna	We can't let Babylonia beat us to it. Everyone, it's time to move.	1																					
77	77		301								Luna	Just as Kowloong said.	1																					
78	78		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Luna	We will decide the future of Earth!	1
