5	5		302								Kamui? What are you doing here?	6	Ah! A wild Kamui appeared!	6																				
6	6		301								Kamui	(I'm here to check something...)	1																					
7	7		301								Kamui	It's a stakeout! I'm checking on you!	1																					
8	8		302								Stakeout?!	9	So you've been waiting for me?	9																				
9	9		301								Kamui	OAO! Did I say that out loud?!	1																					
10	10		302								...	11																						
11	11		301								Kamui	Coughâ€”um, I'm here to expand my database on content regarding human myths!	1																					
12	12		302								Myths?	13																						
13	13		301								Kamui	That's right! Check this out!	1																					
14	14		302								Pandora's box...?	15

16	16		301								Kamui	Have you heard about it, Commandant?	1																					
17	17		302								I have.	18																						
18	18		301								Kamui	I'm not sure if it's something wrong with my database or if it was the person in charge of the data who made a mistake.	1																					
19	19		301								Kamui	I still haven't been able to find out what's inside the box except for darkness, and death, and desperation, and all this pain.	1

25	25		301								Kamui	I guess it means that it's not all bad even if someone opens Pandora's box!	1																					
26	26		301								Kamui	It brings the world hope, doesn't it?	1																					
27	27		302								But all the darkness and pain...	28																						
28	28		301								Kamui	...is nothing as long as there is hope, right?	1																					
29	29		301								Kamui	Even if I... even if I've remembered those bad days, but to me, the me here and now...	1																					
30	30		301								Kamui	What matters more is being with Strike Hawk and Gray Raven, and you, Commandant. With hope.	1																					
31	31		301								Kamui	So stop blaming yourself for that!	1																					
32	32		302								You planned this...!	33																						
33	33		301								Kamui	Whoa... y-you aren't crying, are you?!	1																					
34	34		301								Kamui	Aaaaah! I didn't mean it! I just wanted you to know that it wasn't your fault! I... I...	1
