3	3		301			DialogEnable						A long time ago, before the apocalypse.																						
4	4		301									Like everyone else visiting the seaborne city for the first time, Lustrous is trying to view it and soak in its entirety.																						
5	5		301									If the Golden Age is a crown, then this is one of the brightest jewels on it.																						
6	6		301									The main island glitters under the sun, pearl-white and astonishing. It looks holy, as if it is from another time.																						
7	7		301									When the Phoenician merchants passed the Aegean Sea in their purple-sailed ships and witnessed the sacred flame burning in the Acropolis of Athens, they must have felt the same way.																						
8	8		301								Guide	What a beauty, isn't "she"?																						
9	9		301								Lustrous	...																						
10	10		301									Lustrous does not respond.																						
11	11		301									She is completely focused on the city itself.																						
12	12		301									Foaming waves crash and roar around the island. Every second, billions of gallons of water rush underneath the island as designed, driving the massive tidal stream generators.																						
13	13		301									The generators power the scattered tall buildings on the island. Windows light up in dense rows like stars falling on water.																						
14	14		301									Traffic between the city center and its borders is constant. A light beam is shot into the sky from the ring-shaped, submerged satellite city, disappearing before reaching the clouds with the help of optical camouflage.																						
15	15		301									Supply ships from orbit land directly on the launch platforms everywhere. With radiation shielding, infrared is undetectable two kilometers from the city.																						
16	16		301									Freighters and ships pass by the city, completely unaware of the wonder right next to them.																						
17	17		301									It hides in the ocean, but it also illuminates it.																						
18	18		301									A lighthouse beckoning humanity's future is standing right here, completely unknown.																						
19	19		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Lustrous thinks herself someone who is unmoved by "wonders." She has always been rational, so much so that she has been called cold by others.																						
20	20		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory401.jpg																								
21	21		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						But the moment she sets foot on the landing pad, standing before the seaborne city, she finds herself reconsidering her stance.																						
22	22		301									Her heart is thumping wildly.																						
23	23		301									She recognizes that she is emotional right now. Adrenaline is pumping out in her body, making her heart beat harder and increasing the rate of her blood circulation.																						
24	24		301									Blood rushes into her heart like the water rushing into the tidal stream generators. The gears are turning at remarkable speed, both inside the city and inside her brain.																						
25	25		301									It is not astonishment she is feeling right now. It is something else, something more particular.																						
26	26		301									Her guide has misunderstood her brief silence.																						
27	27		301									He thinks she is dumbfounded by Atlantis like every other newcomer arriving here.

30	30		301							1	Guide	Stop gawking. Catch up.	1																					
31	31		301								Lustrous	...	2																					
32	32		301								Guide	Pretty bad luck that you arrive on "Submergence Day". It's the fishing season, so we're getting more boats hanging around this part of the sea. Optical camouflage won't be enough, so the city will submerge for a month.	1																					
33	33		301								Guide	I'm taking you to the main city. Most of us will work inside the chambers there during submergence.	1																					
34	34		301								Guide	Don't worry. The space is so much bigger than you could ever imagine, and supplies are well stocked like usual. You won't feel any different.	1																					
35	35		301								Guide	I recommend looking at the sun one last time. It might be the only thing you'll miss when we're down there.	1

37	37		301									Lustrous does as he says and turns to look at the sun one last time.																						
38	38		301									The giant ball of fire hangs at the edge of the sky.																						
39	39		301									Lustrous does not feel a thing when she looks at it.																						
40	40		301									She knows how people usually refer to it—earth-gracing, life-giving... more or less. There is nothing new about it.																						
41	41		301									But to her, that has always been a ball of energy.																						
42	42		301									Inside, nuclear fusion is constantly happening. The energy it generates every second is enough to sustain the entirety of earth's civilization for nearly a hundred thousand years.																						
43	43		301									It is unfortunate that humans cannot conquer the sun the way they did the moon.																						
44	44		301									The "distance" between humans and the sun is way too far.																						
45	45		301									But they have a more daring option now.																						
46	46		301									More ambitious than conquering the sun.																						
47	47		301									—Zero-point energy.																						
48	48		301									The source of the sun is simply nuclear fusion, after all. It means that it requires a fuel source at the end of the day.																						
49	49		301									But not zero-point energy. If they can extract it, it will revolutionize humanity's understanding of "energy." All matters can become energy.																						
50	50		301									She is about to become one of those who seek this path. That is why her heart is thumping.																						
51	51		301									Humanity no longer has to conquer the sun. Humanity is about to surpass the sun.																						
52	52		301									Lustrous retracts her gaze, turning it to the staff waiting by the ferry before her.																						
53	53		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She walks toward him, no longer turning back.																						
54	54		401							1	203																							
55	55		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Next to the landing pad is a canal connecting the satellite city and the main city. A boat commonly used to transport goods is parked right next to it.																						
56	56		301									Vera takes a look at the boat, surprised to find that it can still run.																						
57	57		301									The equipment here is surprisingly well-preserved, unlike the ruins left behind by the Punishing Virus in other cities.																						
58	58		301									Vera jumps onto the boat, and you follow suit.																						
59	59		301									Not long after you start the boat, loud noises appear around you.																						
60	60		301									Corrupted, coming from the sea.
