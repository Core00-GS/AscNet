27	27		301								???	Welcome.																						
28	28		301									The female mechanoid at the center smiles, greeting Haicma like a human.																						
29	29		301								???	My name is Arcana. You can call me "Mother".																						
30	30		301								Haicma	Sure, Mother.																						
31	31		301								???	Ha! So accepting and compliant.																						
32	32		301								Arcana	It's the sign of a great student, Zero.																						
33	33		301								Haicma	So, Mother, what is the Church of Machina? Why are you searching for "Sage"? Who made this starship?																						
34	34		301								Zero	Asking questions already?																						
35	35		301									Arcana uses her gentle voice to detail the stories of the machines' survival.																						
36	36		301									Humans are not the only ones suffering from the Punishing Virus.																						
37	37		301									For some machines, those who have awakened and understand "fear" and the concept of machines as a species, the Punishing Virus is a threat to the entire machine race.																						
38	38		301									Not to mention the hostility from humankind out of fear of the virus.																						
39	39		301									After a prolonged period of fighting and devastation from the virus, the awakened machines have gradually received revelations from Sage.																						
40	40		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Slowly, they gather together, acting in secret on Earth as the "Church of Machina".

44	44		301								Arcana	"She" showed me a glimpse, a fragment of the future during so.	1																					
45	45		301								Arcana	"Sagemachina will return to the Church, guiding us away from this broken earth to the end of stars."	1																					
46	46		301								Arcana	"Sagemachina will obtain the key to the Punishing Virus and enters the door it opens."	1																					
47	47		301								Arcana	The starship you are seeing is the base we built for this very plan.	1																					
48	48		301								Arcana	We are currently searching for the design blueprint of Babylonia. Once we obtain it, we will be able to build something similar.	1

56	56		301							1	Arcana	Don't worry. We have more than enough time, and our technology for surveying, mining, building, and recycling is far more advanced and accurate.	1																					
57	57		301								Arcana	So, what do you say? Would you like to join the Church of Machina?	1
