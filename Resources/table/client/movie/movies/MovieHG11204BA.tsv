68	35		301							1	Chrome	There are three genres of drama: tragedy, comedy, and tragicomedy. I believe comedies are more expressive and a good fit for the event.	2																					
69	36		302								Anything to recommend?	37	Do you read a lot, Chrome?	37																				
70	37		301							1	Chrome	Most of the books I read are the functional kind, so I don't know a lot about drama.	2																					
71	38		302								I love reading the short stories recently published on Babylonia Daily.	39																						
72	39	42	301							1	Chrome	Oh, you mean those by... Edgar Helsinki?	2																					
73	41	44	301							1	Chrome	Just a little hobby of mine... ahem.	2																					
74	42	3	302								I think so.	461	I thought you didn't read drama.	41																				
75	461	43	204							1	1																							
76	43	44	301							1	Chrome	His works are beautifully written, a perfect balance between form and substance.	2																					
77	44		301							1	Chrome	Reading his works is like... uh...	2																					
78	45		302								Thrilling, huh?	46	A feeling you can't shake?	47																				
79	46	48	301							1	Chrome	Yeah, you just can't get enough of it.	2																					
80	47	48	301							1	Chrome	Yeah, very thrilling.	2																					
81	48		301							1	Chrome	Apart from his murder mysteries, "Bottled Heaven" and "The Boy with His Heart on the Porch" are excellent works too.	2																					
82	49		301							1	Chrome	Edgar's short-story collection used to be my favorite read.	2																					
83	50		301							1	Chrome	If you're interested, I have a few of his books.	2																					
84	51		302								I sure am.	52	Maybe when I'm less busy.	53																				
85	52	54	301							1	Chrome	Great... I mean, we can exchange notes after you finish reading them.	2																					
86	53	54	301							1	Chrome	And after that, we can borrow more from the library if you want.	2																					
87	54		301							1	Chrome	I think I just got off-topic.	2

89	55		302								No, you didn't.	56	I like it.	57

91	57	58	301							1	Chrome	Uh...	2																					
92	58		301							1	Chrome	Time to pick a script.	2																					
93	59		302								Let me see.	60																						
94	60		301							1		"Frankenstein is a biologist obsessed with the origin of life. With guilty pleasure he frequents morgues to harvest body parts, hoping to piece them together into a giant human..."																						
95	61		302								A classic, but not suitable for the anniversary.	62	Nope!	62																				
96	62		301							1	Chrome	An interesting story, but you're right. It's a shame.	2																					
97	63		301							1		"In seventeenth-century Hungary, there's this countess named Elizabeth whose beauty is known far and wide. Ever since her husband died in war, she's been living alone as a widow in her castle, her beauty fading with each passing day. In an attempt to stay youthful, she secretly murders..."																						
98	64		302								This won't pass the censorship!	65	Next.	65																				
99	65		301									"Romeo and Juliet fall in love with each other at first sight, despite the fact that they come from two rival families. One day, Juliet's cousin provokes Romeo and gets killed by him..."																						
100	66		302								Let's go with this one.	67																						
101	67		301							1	Chrome	Great minds think alike! My vote is for this one too. As for the others... I included them at Kamui's insistence.	2																					
102	68		301							1	Chrome	That's it then. I have to go and check in with my team members.	2																					
103	69		302								You work so hard.	70	Sure.	70																				
104	70		301							1	Chrome	Let's meet this time tomorrow to assign the parts and rehearse the lines. Sound good?	2																					
105	71		302								Okay.	72	Perhaps a little later than that? I don't usually get up this early.	73																				
106	72		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Chrome	I'll be here on time. See you tomorrow.	2																					
107	73	74	301							1	Chrome	...	2																					
108	74	75	301							1	Chrome	Commandant, it's advised that a person should go to bed before twelve at midnight and get at least seven hours of sleep. Bad sleep schedules cause irreversible damage to health.	2																					
109	75	76	301							1	Chrome	So go to bed early.	2																					
110	76		302								Got it.	77	You're treating me more and more like you do with Kamui.	78																				
111	77		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Chrome	Okay. Goodbye, Commandant.	2																					
112	78		301							1	Chrome	Oh, was that too harsh? If so, please pardon my manners.	2																					
113	79		302								It's fine.	80	It's kinda cute.	80
