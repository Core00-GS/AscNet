6	6		301								Lucia	I don't think this area has what you're searching for, and even if there were, the quality wouldn't be up to par.	2																					
7	7		301								Lucia	But... You may be able to find something suitable in the area reclaimed before.	2																					
8	8		301								Nanami	Oh, is that so? Then Nanami is taking a few days off!	1

14	14		301							1	Lucia	I think Nanami's in a hurry to find some sort of metal. She just suddenly came over and asked me its source.	1																					
15	15		301								Lucia	It's nothing rare, just that it's useless as a material so we never collected it.	1																					
16	16		302								Do you know what she's using it for?	17	What kind of metal is it?	18																				
17	17	19	301								Lucia	She didn't tell me, but she looked... happy.	1																					
18	18		301								Lucia	It's an alloy called B2. It's not hard in the first place and was used in the production of fragmentation grenades in the past.	1																					
19	19		302								Feels dangerous...	20	Well, as long as she's happy...	21																				
20	20	22	301								Lucia	You don't need to worry too much, Commandant.	1																					
21	21		301								Lucia	You're right, Commandant.	1																					
22	22		301								Lucia	And I think both Nanami and I have changed a lot ever since we met Commandant.	1

24	24		301								Lucia	When we first met Nanami, I could only feel danger from her.	1																					
25	25		302								Wasn't she always this happy?	26	That's true...	26																				
26	26		204							1	1																							
27	27		301								Lucia	But we changed after meeting you, both me and Nanami.	1																					
28	28		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Anyway, we still have a mission to finish. Let's go, Commandant.	1
