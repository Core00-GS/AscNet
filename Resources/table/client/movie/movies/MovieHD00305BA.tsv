26	26		301							1	Lamia	Yes, Miss Luna.	2																					
27	27		301								Luna	Tell me the results of your recon mission.	1																					
28	28		301								Lamia	Yes, Miss Luna. That person seems to have sold his "foster son" out...	2																					
29	29		301								Luna	Oh?	1																					
30	30		301								Lamia	Back in po-pan when he was still human, he was a man of many titles. "Downtown Tyrant", "Agent of Death", "Behemoth"...	2																					
31	31		301								Lamia	He's involved in all sorts of underground stuff... Even for humans, he's the most despicable sort...	2																					
32	32		301								Luna	...Your words are making me distrust humans even more.	1																					
33	33		301								Lamia	Ah... Well... That's why we... took on such forms, right?	2																					
34	34		204							1	13																							
35	35		301								Luna	Indeed...	1																					
36	36		301								Lamia	S-so, Miss Luna, how should we deal with him and his proposal?	2

38	38		301								Luna	We'll see. Let's get an idea of what he wants from "us" first.	1																					
39	39		204							1	13																							
40	40		301								Luna	If he wishes to have a go at the "filtering," allow him to.	1

47	47		301							1	Roland	An interesting fella came visiting.	1																					
48	48		301								Roland	He's saying a "strange Ascendant" showed up and is conducting some sort of research.	1																					
49	49		301								Roland	But, well, he's likely got deeper ties to that Ascendant than he shows.	1																					
50	50		301								Roland	He's got that Ascendant's trails figured. There's convincing evidence too in the files he provided us with.	1																					
51	51		201							1	500105																							
52	52		301							1	Luna	But, why would he betray that Ascendant?	1																					
53	53		201							1	500008																							
54	54		301							1	Roland	Who knows?	1																					
55	55		301								Roland	And, quite frankly, this Ascendant can only be "her" work. The one that's been showing up nearby.	1																					
56	56		301								Roland	Apparently she's just the same as before, finding people that can be saved.	1																					
57	57		201							1	500105																							
58	58		301							1	Luna	...This is getting troublesome.	1																					
59	59		301								Luna	If we let her run wild, our work as agents of the Ascension-Network will be hindered.	1																					
60	60		201							1	500008																							
61	61		301							1	Roland	So—what do we do?	1																					
62	62		201							1	500105																							
63	63		301							1	Luna	Give me the files that the "interesting fella" gave you.	1																					
64	64		301								Luna	I'll decide after I have a look.	1

70	70		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Luna	"Shome", huh...	1																					
71	71		301									From the history of this person, he should not have lived through the "filter."																						
72	72		301									But if the files are true, then he must have gained protection by the network through certain means.																						
73	73		301									And, he is now using the power from the Ascension-Network to conduct dangerous research.																						
74	74		301									If there's anyone to "save" this kind of person, "she" is the only possible candidate.																						
75	75		204							1	13																							
76	76		301								Luna	Sigh... You're an agent, and yet you keep causing such troubles...	1																					
77	77		301									To assimilate other agents to our side, we'll need a display of power.																						
78	78		301									And for this, we need a scapegoat—one we know who will never stand on our side.																						
79	79		301									——Which, as far as we can tell, leaves only "her."																						
80	80		301								Luna	Though I'd prefer not to provoke other agents before the time is right...	1																					
81	81		301								Luna	But you're showing up in our grounds and messing things up... We have no other choice...	1																					
82	82		204							1	21																							
83	83		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Luna	After all, this is an agent's duty.	1
