4	4		301									To your surprise, the small machines also flee without putting up a fight.																						
5	5		301									Nobody notices, however, that during your chase, the tiny tracking device in the pocket of the jacket Watanabe gave you had fallen on the ground, lost without a trace.

10	10		301								Nanami	So it is! I've been hoping for a new friend, and you will do just fine! That's right!	1

16	16		301								Karenina	If we weren't here, you could be in serious danger! Can't you act a bit more serious?!	2																					
17	17		301								Nanami	...Danger?	1																					
18	18		301								Karenina	And stop trying to befriend my CUB! It's an expensive asset from Babylonia!	2																					
19	19		301								Nanami	Wait a minute—wait! I think you got confused!	1																					
20	20		301								Karenina	Huh? You're the one who's confused and not appreciating our help!	2																					
21	21		301									Karenina's famous temper reaches a boiling point, and her CUB responds to her rage by hovering overhead and circling over her.

25	25		302								I agree.	26	It's about time to return.	30																				
26	26		301								Bianca	Then let's move.	1																					
27	27		301								Bianca	We can't confirm if those small machines will fight back at this point. From what we've seen so far... their actions have been highly unusual.	1

35	35		301								Karenina	You mean how they retreated without a fight? Tsk, those tricky bastards really did annoy me...	2																					
36	36		301								Bianca	We acted hastily because we were worried about Nanami, but... those maybe-Corrupted were acting quite odd indeed.	1																					
37	37		301								Bianca	Compared to the enemies we fought before... it's rare to find mechanoids that still retain their consciousness. And they were behaving so much less hostile than how Corrupted would act...	1																					
38	38		301								Bianca	If they can't be Corrupted... then, maybe they are... Awakened?	1
