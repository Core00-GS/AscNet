22	22		301								Noan	Arms dealers, you said?	2																					
23	23		301								Rachel	Right. See, the weapons the Cargo Crew uses are things that the guys up there don't need anymore or are simply too old	1																					
24	24		301								Rachel	It's a real pain in the butt fighting the Corrupted and bandits we come across on our missions with those weapons. Just try to imagine how we'd fare fighting the guys up there with them.	1																					
25	25		301								Rachel	They're just going to keep coming back down here to screw us over if we don't have what it takes to stop them.	1																					
26	26		301								Noan	Is that our only way out, though?	2																					
27	27		301								Rachel	Yes, it is. The royal family is nothing but an empty shell now as it is, and the aristocrats that are still around have all sided with Ashlar. Trying to work things out peacefully with them is a waste of time because they don't give a damn about people's lives.	1																					
28	28		301								Rachel	And given how dire the situation is out there, we can't really ask any external forces to come and help us deal with ACA—in other words, we're on our own, and we need arms to fend for ourselves.	1																					
29	29		301								Rachel	Now... we need to hurry up because things are only going to work to our disadvantage if we let them drag on. About Bancroft, though...	1

157	157		301								Field	Did you check the camcorder?	3																					
158	158		301								Bancroft	No, son, we don't have that. I heard they only carry a camcorder when they're delivering valuable goods.	1																					
159	159		301								Field	Is it expensive to make one?	3																					
160	160		301								Bancroft	I had the same thought actually, but people's theory is that we just won't bother trying to catch the perps anyways even if we have them on the camcorder, because they're mostly just homeless Scavengers.	1

167	167		301								Bancroft	I know, but she's taken over Julie's place because Assad has apparently vowed for her competency, and part of what we do overlaps with her area of responsibility. I only address her as a chef because that's what everyone else still calls her.	1

174	174		301								Bancroft	That's fine. I'll go and exchange some for you. Let's go.	1																					
175	175		301								Noan	...Exchange?	2																					
176	176		301								Field	Yup. Only the doctor up on the upper level has the medicine I need, so we need to go to him to trade in resources for my medicine.	3																					
177	177		301								Noan	Do you still have any resources left?	2																					
178	178		301								Bancroft	Only thing we have left is my mother's bracelet... We'll visit the doctor again in three months, and I'll have to save up enough resources by then.	1

207	207		301								Cargo Captain Shauna	And Bancroft isn't the only snitch around. The aristocrats kind of know what we're up to, so they've set up a nice little "system of rewards" in place to turn us against one another down here.	3

236	236		301									Weyland protests as he puts down his bowl and joins the ranks of Niino and Noan.																						
237	237		301								Cargo Captain Niino	What are these snitches after, though?	1																					
238	238		301								Cargo Member Weyland	Probably the perks they get to have right away. Why give a damn to some long-haul revolution when there are perks you get to enjoy right away, right?	2																					
239	239		301								Cargo Member Weyland	There are tons of scums like Bancroft out there that are willing to do just about anything to save their own butts. I can't believe he's the kid's dad.	2																					
240	240		301								Cargo Member Weyland	I've seen the boy. Cute kid, pretty smart too, and he's almost as well-behaved as Four-Eyes.	2

249	249		301									Shivering from laughing, Shauna slaps Noan on the shoulder.																						
250	250		301								Cargo Captain Shauna	People change, especially kids.	1																					
251	251		301								Cargo Captain Niino	Birds of a feather flock together, eh?	2																					
252	252		301								Cargo Member Weyland	I gather the kid has been flocking a whole lot with you, then?	3																					
253	253		301								Cargo Captain Shauna	Well, not a whole lot, but we do eat together on a regular basis.	1																					
254	254		301								Cargo Captain Shauna	Which isn't a bad thing, really. People broaden your world, right?	1																					
255	255		301								Cargo Member Weyland	Word. And where we were just now?	3																					
256	256		301								Cargo Captain Niino	You were just saying how Bancroft can do anything.	2																					
257	257		301								Cargo Member Weyland	Right. Dude has to snitch to survive because he's so at his wit's end.	3																					
258	258		301								Cargo Member Weyland	But everyone is going down together if things down here stay the way they do.	3																					
259	259		301								Cargo Member Weyland	What exactly is to blame, though? The aristocrats? Human nature? Or this hellhole itself?	3																					
260	260		301								Cargo Captain Shauna	A bit of each, I guess.	1																					
261	261		301								Cargo Captain Niino	...	2																					
262	262		301								Cargo Captain Niino	But going back to what I was saying, you want to stay away from Field, Noan. Bancroft is anything but kind.	2

267	267		201							1	500454																							
268	268		301							1	Cargo Member Weyland	...We're saying these things for your sake, son!	1

277	277		301							1	Cargo Captain Niino	Why are you taking the kid's side, son?	1																					
278	278		201							1	500521																							
279	279		301							1	Noan	Because he's my friend, and... I've been in his shoes.	1																					
280	280		301								Noan	If you can't stop doubting and hating on someone that needs help, how are you going to prove yourself innocent when the table turns somewhere down the road?	1																					
281	281		201							1	500398																							
282	282		301							1	Cargo Captain Shauna	Word. I'm blown away, kid. Seems like all the reading is doing wonders here.	1

284	284		301							1	Cargo Member Weyland	C'mon, are you taking the kid's side, too?	1																					
285	285		301								Cargo Member Weyland	See, Noan hangs around Rachel all the time now, and you just never know what Bancroft is gonna do if Noan gets screwed over somewhere down the road.	1

293	293		301								Noan	Do you know who killed her, Weyland?	1

295	295		301									Noan does have his own theory about his mother's death—yet he's never had any information to check against his theory, and he never figured out the perp's motive.
