11	10		301							1	Nikola	It's necessary as it's an emergency and a special case.	2																					
12	11		301								Asimov	The Science Council and Star of Life are in the same boat with you now.	1																					
13	12		301								Nikola	No need to worry about the law issues, I'll explain to the council.	2																					
14	13		301								Asimov	Is there something to do with your relationship with President Hassen?	1																					
15	14		301								Nikola	No, I'm just good at dealing with troublesome works... like this.	2																					
16	15		301								Nikola	Anyway, we should play our own parts. When it comes to the future of humans, we shouldn't have any hesitation...	2																					
17	16		301								Nikola	Now get prepared for the remote surgery.	2																					
18	17		301								Asimov	...	1																					
19	18		301								Asimov	Frankly speaking, we're only able to simulate the human consciousness even with the technology of M.I.N.D.	1																					
20	19		301								Asimov	You should know that direct operation towards consciousness is way more complicated than general surgery, right?	1																					
21	20		301								Nikola	Of course, otherwise I wouldn't let you, the only person who has acquired this skill in the whole Babylonia, lead this operation.	2																					
22	21		301									......																						
23	22		301								Asimov	The analysis of consciousness has been completed. We will make a proposal regarding the process of memory...	1																					
24	23		301								Nikola	That's our new pride of Babylonia.	2																					
25	24		301								Asimov	I'm just trying to end the whole thing as soon as possible...	1																					
26	25		301								Nikola	Then I should tell you the truth.	2																					
27	26		301								Nikola	The past experience has caused ineffaceable impacts on her.	2																					
28	27		301								Nikola	Then I have to tell you that part of her consciousness is in a state of high entropy, which is kind of chaotic, and very... persistent.	2																					
29	28		301								Nikola	That's why I need her... to stay loyal to humanity.	2																					
30	29		301								Asimov	In short, you want to erase her memory...	1																					
31	30		301								Nikola	Only if necessary.	2																					
32	31		301								Asimov	Then I have to tell you that part of her consciousness is in a state of high-entropy, which is kind of chaotic, and very... persistent.	1																					
33	32		301								Asimov	Even if I can deal with it, our connection is insufficient to meet the requirement of such a high-precision transfer.	1																					
34	33		301								Asimov	If we insist to extract her memory, I cannot undertake the consequences.	1																					
35	34		301								Nikola	Then what's your plan?	2																					
36	35		301								Asimov	I think we better save that part of memory in the form of subconsciousness.	1																					
37	36		301								Asimov	If we can prevent it from being awakened, we'll be able to keep the integrity of her personality so that it won't be affected by that part of her memory.	1																					
38	37		301								Asimov	However, we cannot promise whether deviation will occur with time or not even if we adopt the more conservative plan.	1																					
39	38		301								Nikola	I just need her will to be strong enough to last until the end of the war, as for the deviation...	2																					
40	39		301								Asimov	...	1																					
41	40		301								Asimov	In this case, I'll carry out a branch operation on her consciousness, and make a copy of it.	1																					
42	41		301								Nikola	Wait, as I remember, your principle is to retain the uniqueness of consciousness, right?	2																					
43	42		301								Asimov	Yes, and it's the only way to guarantee...	1																					
44	43		301								Nikola	You... become astonishingly obsessive when it comes to protecting the consciousness of the Construct...	2																					
45	44		301								Asimov	...	1																					
46	45		301								Nikola	I thought it was quite common for you to deal with cases like that when doing scientific researches.	2																					
47	46		301								Nikola	Hmph, I'm quite surprised that you're such a compassionate person, seeing that you usually treat the Constructs as your objects of study.	2																					
48	47		301								Asimov	Don't overthink it. As a scientific researcher, I need a copy of her main personality as a control, that's all.	1																					
49	48		301								Nikola	It's up to you... In fact, we only need to ensure there's only one active consciousness at the same time.	2																					
50	49		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Nikola	Alright, I would rather listen to the advice from a professionalâ€”Is that okay?	2
