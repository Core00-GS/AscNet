5	4		301							1	???	...Quite the reinforcements, Babylonia! They're all wounded!	1																					
6	5		301									After dismounting the snowmobile and entering the base, you see a disgruntled man accompanied by guards blocking the way.																						
7	6		301									Looks like all of the rescued soldiers were settled here.

10	7		301							1	Atiel	They just need some minor treatment before returning to battle. We're built different!	2																					
11	8		301									As if unable to detect the man's dissatisfaction, Atiel explains in her usual bubbliness.																						
12	9		301								Atiel	Anyway, enough about that. I brought the last commandant over. Our forces are all here now.	2

14	10		301								???	The boss you've been talking about, eh...? Must be the one behind... Ah!	1

16	11		301							1	Rosetta	...	2																					
17	12		301								???	Y-you're... Rosetta... Why are you here?!	1																					
18	13		301									The man panics at the sight of Rosetta. He takes a few uncontrollable steps back, but realizing that he is in public, he forces his legs to a halt.																						
19	1005		204							2	4																							
20	14		301								Rosetta	It's been a while, Captain.	2																					
21	15		301									Rosetta's expression is unreadable. She merely follows with a light sigh.																						
22	16		301								Rosetta	Commandant, this is Captain Staessen of the Arctic Route Union. He was the one who requested reinforcements.	2																					
23	1006		302								Hello, Captain.	17	Between you and Rosetta...	18																				
24	17	3000	301								Staessen	Ahem... Hello... You must be 【kuroname】.	1																					
25	18	3000	301								Staessen	Not with Rosetta, the Forest Guard... There's no way I could be as calm and collected as you when facing those sinners.	1

27	1007		201							1	500206																							
28	19		301							1	Atiel	Well, now that we've got the self introductions over. Captain, Could you give a sitrep to our boss?	1																					
29	1008		201							1	500199																							
30	20		301							1	Staessen	Alright... I don't know how much Rosetta has told you, but I'll give you the run down from the beginning.	1																					
31	21		301								Staessen	The ARU is on the verge of collapse. We've treated this tide too lightly.	1

33	1010		201							2	500214		400																					
34	22		301							1	Rosetta	On the verge of collapse... How could this go belly up so quickly?	2																					
35	23		301								Staessen	Pah, isn't that obvious? All because the Forest Guards can't hold the line.	1																					
36	24		301								Staessen	The bionics blitzed the shore, then captured our warehouse and energy pipeline. It'll be our death sentence if we continue to go on without supplies.	1

38	1012		201							1	500206																							
39	25		301							1	Atiel	The worst part is not knowing where the bionics came from. Correct?	1																					
40	1013		201							1	500199		-400																					
41	1014		201							2	500214		400																					
42	26		301							1	Staessen	Ugh...	1																					
43	1015		302								Where did the bionics come from?	27	How long has it been going on?	28																				
44	27	3001	301								Staessen	I don't know... Who knows why the bionics are suddenly appearing in droves?	1																					
45	28	29	301								Staessen	Two months...	1																					
46	29	30	301								Rosetta	You mean you've kept this in the dark for two months... You waited until the last minute to inform Babylonia. Is that right?	2																					
47	30	3001	301								Staessen	...Hmph.	1

50	31		301								Staessen	You over there, bring me the map!	1																					
51	32		301									Staessen orders another guard to activate the projection terminal. The entire Arctic Route Union and its surrounding terrain manifest as a holographic map.																						
52	33		301								Staessen	See the circles on the map? Those are the regions taken by the bionics. We need Babylonia's help in recovering them.	1																					
53	34		301								Staessen	Enemies are sure to be in greater number there. Likely at least 60 bionic units per region.	1																					
54	35		301								Staessen	I'm not trained for combat, so I'm not much use to you out in the field.	1

58	36		301							1	Rosetta	Speaking of... Where are Diana and the others?	1																					
59	37		301								Simon	The Forest Guards are out conducting guerrilla warfare. We decided on this tactical direction during our last meeting.	2																					
60	38		301									Finally recovering from his motion sickness, Simon indicates several of the Forest Guard's patrol routes on the map.																						
61	39		301								Simon	I'm sure Captain Staessen has brought you up to speed now, Boss. Why don't we split up?	2																					
62	1020		302								A squad each?	40	We're not going together?	41																				
63	40	42	301								Simon	Yeah. The occupied areas are interconnected. Even if we retake part of the pipelines, it would be pointless without all of them recovered.	2																					
64	41	42	301								Simon	We won't cover as much ground together. Considering we're not up against the Corrupted, splitting up seems like our best bet.	2																					
65	42		301								Rosetta	I see... An astute command. You speak just like a commandant.	1																					
66	43		301								Simon	Um... Well, I am a commandant, Rosetta.	2																					
67	44		301									The suddenly dependable Simon rouses Rosetta's suspicions. After all, he was doubled over with motion sickness when they first met.																						
68	1021		201							1	500206		-400																					
69	45		301							1	Atiel	Simon might not look all that reliable, but his tactical decisions are on-point! Well, it's decided then. We'll take the right. You guys take the left.	1																					
70	46		301								Atiel	Let's recover the territory ASAP and restore peace to the ARU!	1

72	1023		201							1	500214																							
73	47		301							1	Rosetta	Seems doable, but before that, I need to make preparations for you, Commandant.	1																					
74	1024		302								What preparations?

76	48		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Rosetta	You need protection.	1
