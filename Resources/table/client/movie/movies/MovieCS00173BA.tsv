4	4		301									There is a commotion outside the book storage room. Noan flips open the vent cover to find over thirty upper-level guards charging into the Commoner Carriage and blocking the narrow passageways, causing many to groan and complain.

6	6		301							1	Noan	(What's happening...)	1																					
7	7		301									Crawling inside the air duct toward where most guards have gathered, Noan begins to see a trail of blood as if someone was dragged across the floor. Then he sees Assad's blood-soaked clothes.

11	11		301									Assad's broken bones are exposed in the air and coated in dried blood, piercing through his flesh and skin. Part of his head is missing—his toothless mouth is silently bemoaning the pain he suffered before his death.																						
12	12		301									Tight ropes used to tie Assad up are twisting his body unnaturally. The guards around him seem to be displaying the cruel scene on purpose, showcasing how Assad was killed.

23	23		301							1	Upper-Level Guard 2	Rachel, this isn't like one of the little brawls in the past. We could take them at face value and only punish those on the scene.	2																					
24	24		301								Upper-Level Guard 2	But this time, it's threatening all of us. Your silence is only going to escalate things. Our boss will send us to our deaths if we don't have it all sorted out today.	2

32	32		301								Upper-Level Guard 2	We don't want to make it difficult for you. There's no need for us to make a scene here—we're "all" working for the people upstairs. Just hand over the things, and no one else gets hurt.	2
