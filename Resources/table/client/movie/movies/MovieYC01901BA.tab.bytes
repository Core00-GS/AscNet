33	33		301									She does not feel a sense of belonging to this city at all, but as someone who has been moving in and out of the city for a long time, she feels a sense of familiarity.																						
34	34		301									A rusty bridge extends out into the distance, its other end enveloped by the fog. Even though she cannot see it, Alpha knows where the bridge leads.																						
35	35		301									She cast away her original name here...																						
36	36		301									...in order to break with the past.																						
37	37		301									Luna only gave her a silent nod regarding it when she returned.

60	59		301									As Roland passes Alpha with a nonchalant smile, he leans over and lowers his voice.																						
61	60		301								Roland	I'm going to deal with Gabriel's "backup." Only then will Luna be able to leave the core.																						
62	61		202							1					1																			
63	62		301									With a quick stroke of his chain blade, he leaps into the darkness of the core.

79	78		301									Alpha's blade slices across Gabriel's chest, sending sparks flying everywhere. Gabriel rips off his tattered cloak, revealing his colossal mechanical stature.

81	80		301							1	Gabriel	You... really are the biggest threat to the Ascension-Network...	1

83	82		201							1	500100																							
84	83		301							1	Œ±	I know what you're conspiring, Gabriel. You might as well have it written on your face.	1

86	85		301								Œ±	I can only hope that those Gray Ravens will last long enough for me to get to her.	1																					
87	86		201							1	500179																							
88	87		301							1	Gabriel	I can't understand why you choose to believe in those inadequate Constructs. They've most likely become food for the Polyphage.	1																					
89	88		201							1	500100																							
90	89		301							1	Œ±	No.	1																					
91	90		301								Œ±	This time, I'm choosing to believe in "myself." And, Gabriel‚Äî	1

95	94		202							1					1																			
96	95		301									Alpha raises her katana, her eyes burning with fury.																						
97	96		301									Alpha closes in, attempting to expose a weak spot on Gabriel with a series of continuous strikes. Gabriel is forced back, barely managing to counter her every move with his cane.																						
98	97		301									Although he is unaware that she was seriously injured in her M.I.N.D., Gabriel still notices that her strikes are weaker than before.																						
99	98		301									Seeing a rare opening, he gives it everything he has got, abandoning defense for offense.																						
100	99		201							1	500100																							
101	100		301							1	Œ±	...Perfect!	1																					
102	101		202							1					1																			
103	102		301									Once one of the combatants gives up on defense, the battle will soon be over.																						
104	103		301									Gabriel has staked everything on this battle in order to achieve the lofty goal given to him by the Ascension-Network.																						
105	104		301									However, as the battle goes on, Alpha's M.I.N.D. also gradually starts to stabilize.

110	109		202							1					1																			
111	110		301									Sensing that something is amiss, Gabriel immediately leaps high into the air and delivers an armor-pulverizing blow in Alpha's direction.

114	113		301									But when the dust settles, the only person on the cracked ground is Gabriel.																						
115	114		301									He is completely unable to hit the fleet-footed Alpha. His immense strength, of which he has been so proud of, is useless if he cannot land a hit.

123	122		301								Gabriel	...Hah... I cannot fault Miss Luna for relying on you.																						
124	123		301									Gabriel crawls among the ruins, dragging his broken body. His legs and wings have all become nothing but scrap metal.																						
125	124		301									Alpha steps over his broken limbs and walks over to his side, raising her katana‚Äî

130	129		301							1	???	Alpha.	1																					
131	130		301									An irreverent call comes from behind her and with it, walls start to appear around them, getting thicker and thicker. Alpha pivots, turning around and slicing with her katana, but she is not able to cut through them.

139	138		301								Gabriel	...You are...																						
140	139		301								Vonnegut	Call me Vonnegut. I'm an agent.	2																					
141	140		301								Œ±	So, you are... Vonnegut.	1																					
142	141		301									Alpha sheathes her katana, calmly appraising the black figure before her.																						
143	142		301								Vonnegut	Looks like you've heard of me.	2																					
144	143		301								Œ±	Of course. If it wasn't for your Ascendant underling, that incident wouldn't have happened.	1																					
145	144		301								Vonnegut	I only had him bring about what the humans had been hoping for all along. That commandant‚ÄîRavenge, I believe? He wasn't the first to hold those beliefs and won't be the last to die for them.	2																					
146	145		301								Vonnegut	I believe you've seen quite a lot of this.	2																					
147	146		301								Œ±	I don't pity that scoundrel, but that incident caused the deaths of others, not just his.	1																					
148	147		301								Vonnegut	It's all for Ascnet and the filtering, Alpha.	2																					
149	148		301								Vonnegut	It's not my intention to kill humans or Constructs. I'm simply running an experiment to increase the efficiency of the filtering process.	2																					
150	149		301								Vonnegut	Back then in Babylonia, you were furious that your comrades had to be sacrificed, but now that you've become an Ascendant, are you really planning to oppose the filtering?	2																					
151	150		301								Œ±	...	1																					
152	151		301								Vonnegut	That's what I thought.	2																					
153	152		301								Œ±	Why are you here?	1																					
154	153		301								Vonnegut	For the "glad tidings," of course.	2																					
155	154		301								Vonnegut	The Punishing Virus has exhibited the ability to become organic and these new lifeforms are truly the peak of perfection!	2																					
156	155		301								Vonnegut	This planet is undergoing a rebirth and as an agent, I, of course, would like to bear witness to it.	2																					
157	156		301								Gabriel	...!																						
158	157		301								Vonnegut	You're the one who hatched the Polyphage in the Red Tide, aren't you?	2																					
159	158		301								Vonnegut	You saved the reborn Punishing Virus and opened up new possibilities to Ascnet. Good job.	2																					
160	159		301								Gabriel	You... approve of this?																						
161	160		301								Vonnegut	Of course.	2																					
162	161		301								Vonnegut	This is a step in the evolution of Ascnet.	2																					
163	162		301									Vonnegut's eyes are riveted on the gushing Red Tide below with appreciation.																						
164	163		301								Vonnegut	Unfortunately, I came a little too late and Luna's destroyed the Polyphage. The Babylonians have also arrived and will soon clear out this area.	2																					
165	164		301								Vonnegut	As much as I'd love to prevent this catastrophe, as long as we're unable to make a move on Babylonia, that thorn in our side, wiping out individual Babylonians won't make a difference.	2																					
166	165		301									He shifts his gaze from the Red Tide to Gabriel, who lies behind him, struggling to crawl out from under the boulder, his hand reaching out.																						
167	166		301								Vonnegut	Don't worry, as long as the breeder's knowledge remains, there's still hope.	2																					
168	167		301									He claps his hands and the boulder pressing down on Gabriel is blown to smithereens.

170	169		301								Œ±	Vonnegut!	1																					
171	170		301								Vonnegut	Alpha, I'll undo the force field between you, but I have something to tell you before that.	2																					
172	171		301								Vonnegut	Luna's been rescued from the Polyphage and is highly likely to have been taken by the Babylonians.	2																					
173	172		301								Vonnegut	You know what this means, don't you?	2																					
174	173		301								Vonnegut	Can you bear the thought of her having to go through what you went through?	2																					
175	174		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStory/FxUiStoryKejiBg.prefab																							
176	175		301									He smiles and with a snap of his fingers, the force field in Alpha's way dissipated. She tightens her grip on her weapon, glaring at the person standing between her and Gabriel's broken body.																						
177	176		401							2	1513																							
178	177		202							1	2																							
179	178		301									But ultimately, she chooses to hurry toward the Abyss, where the Polyphage was.

181	180		301							1	Vonnegut	Get up, breeder.	1																					
182	181		301								Vonnegut	I know you're loyal to Ascnet. You yearn for greater power to augment your body.	1																					
183	182		301								Vonnegut	So I'll bestow upon you new life and a power that is befitting of the name Gabriel.	1

187	186		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Ignoring the two of them, Alpha hurriedly rushes toward the Polyphage.																						
188	187		301									But all that remains there is the Babylonian reinforcement. Whether to battle them or continue searching, she still cannot find Luna.																						
189	188		301									Have the humans gotten her?																						
190	189		301									A feeling of unease spreads through Alpha, but it is precisely because of this that she has to search for Luna.
