5	6		301									The floor is tiled with dark, dirty, moldy wood, squeaking every time she steps on it as if it is going to break any moment.																						
6	7		301									Confetti can be found among the dirt in the corner of the living room and on the spiderwebs on the roof, ironically celebrating the gloomy idleness.																						
7	8		301									A black moth flaps its wings. It looks exactly like the one No. 21 first saw when you entered the town.																						
8	9		301									It flies past the broken chair, the bodies of dead Corrupted, and the darkened bloodstain on the wall, stopping at a piece of colorful paper hanging from the roof.

16	17		301									By the time it spreads its wings again, it has transformed into a beautiful, vivid butterfly. Wherever it goes, the crimson stains and cobwebs gradually fade and vanish into the wall.																						
17	18		301									The patterns on the wall start to brighten and clear up.																						
18	19		301									The butterfly passes the long dining table, and the candles light up one by one, their tiny flames quivering, warmly illuminating the room.																						
19	20		301									Pleasant and happy sounds come out of the television. The stuffed animals scattered on the floor revert back to their clean, fluffy selves. The dead flowers in the vases bloom once more into beautiful daisies.																						
20	21		301									The butterfly keeps going, flying up the stairs and vanishing inside the shadow where it turns.

23	24		301							1	???	Luna, have you started tidying?	1																					
24	25		301									The girl walking out of the shadow has short, shoulder-length red and black hair and a youthful face. A party hat made with paper sits slanted on her head, and confetti covers her shoulders.																						
25	26		301									Despite her age, there is still a sense of resolve in her expression.																						
26	27		302								...Lucia?	28	Luna?	28																				
27	28		301									You turn around and look. A wooden rocking horse drifts back and forth by the fireplace, the sound of water boiling coming out of the kitchen, the television playing a show. But there is nothing—no one—beyond that.																						
28	29		301								???	Luna... stop standing there.	1																					
29	30		302								...	31																						
30	31		301								???	Come on, I know you can hear me!	1																					
31	32		302								...Me?	33																						
32	33		301									Those words come out of No. 21's mouth. Your confusion has been brewing inside her M.I.N.D.																						
33	34		301								???	There's no one else here.	1																					
34	35		301									Before you can react, an unexpected combination of gripe and joy overtakes you, compelling you to act.																						
35	36		302								But... it's so difficult to pack them up!	37																						
36	37		301									You shiver at the words you just spurted out. But you are no longer in control, as line after line comes out of your mouth like capsules coming out of a gacha machine after it has been fed coins.																						
37	38		302								I don't know how to put them back in...	39																						
38	39		301									A small hill of empty gift boxes piled on the sofa seems to have heard you, and they fall all over the floor, unable to bear their own weight.																						
39	40		301								???	It's because you were impatient and opened all the boxes yourself!	1																					
40	41		302								They were for us anyway, hehe!	42																						
41	42		301								???	Forget the boxes, then. I'll move them into the bedroom.	1																					
42	43		302								Okay! Lucia is the best!	44																						
43	44		301									Despite its insignificance, getting your way when you were being capricious has filled your body with the happiness and satisfaction of the mundane.																						
44	45		301								???	But we still have to clean up the floor and set the table before Dad and Mom are back.	1																					
45	46		302								I know...	48																						
46	47		202							1					1																			
47	48		301									You stick your tongue out and turn around, eagerly heading toward the storage room where the cleaning products are stored.

55	56		301									You reach out for the door, but your fingers go right through—the illusions around you immediately melt away, and the colors dull.																						
56	58		301									The storage before you turns into a few empty shelves on the wall. A scrawled, child-like picture painted with red crayons sits above, with "Go to Hell and meet Voooo" written next to it. It looks ridiculous but scary.																						
57	59		301									They drag you back to reality. The emotions that have taken over you are also gone without a trace.																						
58	60		201							1	500328					1																		
59	61		301							1		The smile on No. 21's face immediately turns back to an emotionless indifference.																						
60	62		301								No. 21	What. Was. That.	1																					
61	63		302								Ugh... (Try and think)	64																						
62	64		301								No. 21	The thing in your head was affecting me.	1																					
63	65		301								No. 21	I'm not used to saying strange words. Nor smiling.	1																					
64	66		301								No. 21	I don't like smiling.	1																					
65	67		301								No. 21	But I couldn't control it.	1																					
66	68		302								Me neither.	69	Smiling is a good look for you.	70																				
67	69	71	301								No. 21	You neither?	1																					
68	70		301								No. 21	?	1																					
69	71		301								No. 21	But that wasn't me.	1																					
70	72		301								No. 21	Could you not control it either?	1																					
71	73		302			DialogDisable					Yeah. When we're in those... visions, I'm also drawn in.	74																						
72	74		302								And I couldn't control myself.	75																						
73	75		301			DialogEnable					No. 21	But...	1																					
74	76		301								No. 21	I don't understand what they were doing. I've never seen a room like this or tried things like that. But something about them made me feel comfortable.	1																					
75	77		301								No. 21	That feels...	1																					
76	78		301									Her expressions distorts, seemingly struggling to find the right words to describe how the experience has made her feel.																						
77	79		301								No. 21	...	1																					
78	80		204							1	2																							
79	81		302								???	82																						
80	82		204							1	3																							
81	83		301							1	No. 21	It made me want to do this.	1																					
82	84		301									The distorted smile fades from her face, leaving only puzzlement and disappointment.																						
83	85		301								No. 21	But it's wrong. This should be frightening. Enemies should be scared seeing it, so I can kill them more easily.	1																					
84	86		202							1					1																			
85	87		301									Not even knowing what a smile is, the inexperienced No. 21 finds everything happening here confusing. She cannot understand or accept sentiments like happiness and comfort, and she is losing herself because of that.																						
86	88		301									And this is happening... because of you. You owe it to her to explain everything.																						
87	89		302								I'm sorry, 21.	90																						
88	90		201							1	500328																							
89	91		301							1	No. 21	Why are you apologizing?	1																					
90	92		401							1	41																							
91	93		302			DialogDisable					I don't want to get too touchy-feely.	94																						
92	94		302								But this experience must have been very unusual for you.	95																						
93	95		302								It's my responsibility to ease your confusion.	96																						
94	96		301			DialogEnable					No. 21	Am I your responsibility?	1																					
95	97		302			DialogDisable					I promise you everything here will be resolved.	98																						
96	98		302								I'll do my best to answer all your questions after this as well.	99																						
97	99		301			DialogEnable					No. 21	...Understood.	1																					
98	100		301									But not now. Maybe when the dust is settled.																						
99	101		301									The Gray Ravens... are still waiting for you.																						
100	102		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					There is a more important mystery for you to solve right now.
