16	16		301									"Hyena" unscrews the vent skillfully and scurries inside.

30	30		301								Outside the Blocked Door	Didn't Leader say to finish cleaning this area today?																						
31	31		301								Outside the Blocked Door	Let's pull it down. If the inspection crew left some wasted fuel cell there without tellin' us, you and your power shear will send us to see our makers!																						
32	32		301								Outside the Blocked Door	...Fine, we'll go take care of the rubbish in the transmission room first. Come on!

41	41		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						If possible, she would rather have more food than pretty packaging... Though she thinks that from time to time, she is already grateful that there is anything to eat at all.																						
42	42		301									The fine packaging finally breaks under the rough tearing of "Hyena", revealing a small piece of bread.																						
43	43		301								"Hyena"	...What a waste.																						
44	44		301									"Hyena" tears up the bread and gobbles it up.																						
45	45		301									This is the only time of the day when she can feel satisfaction, as this means the harshest part of the day is over and she has secured the energy for survival tomorrow.																						
46	46		301								"Hyena"	...I'm full.																						
47	47		301								"Hyena"	Time to move.																						
48	48		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					"Hyena" quickly packs up her own belongings and rolls up her sleeping bag. She then quietly exits the inspection room through the manhole leading outside.

59	59		301								Boy's Voice	(Shhhhh, I'll go get provisions once it's morning!)																						
60	60		301									The tent becomes quiet again. It seems that no one told them people from other carriages have no right to claim provisions.
