3	3		301			DialogEnable						The minimalist tavern Changyu chose is a little ragged but well-supplied. With the token he stole, Changyu has no trouble getting into a place of this caliber to rent a room. A simple one, to avoid attention.																						
4	4		301									Right now, he is sitting by the bed cross-legged, listening to the singing outside. The antique television in the room is playing movies of generations past, and the moonlight has tainted Changyu's shadow blue.

12	12		301								Changyu	Uncle Fu is the best! I'm so blessed.	1																					
13	13		301									Changyu squeals with delight, snatching the takeout box Huainan hands him.

24	22		301								Changyu	Gobble—	1

27	24		301								Changyu	Hey, Huainan... Shall we play a game?	1																					
28	25		301								Huainan	What game?	2																					
29	26		301								Changyu	Let's see... Tell me your biggest wish in five seconds!	1																					
30	27		301								Changyu	Now, I wish tomorrow was the Dragon Boat Festival, then we could go get rice dumplings at Uncle Fu's. His dumplings are the absolute best in the world! You haven't really lived until you've tried one.	1																					
31	230		204							2																								
32	28		301								Huainan	That's it?	2																					
33	29		301								Changyu	Sure. I mean, I also hope that everything goes well tomorrow night at the Trade Fair... But I can't really see things going wrong when I'm involved.	1																					
34	30		301								Huainan	Sometimes I wonder where you got your damn confidence... But I'd be lying if I say you aren't good at this.	2																					
35	31		204							1

39	35		301								Changyu	Don't you notice? Whether it's those rich assholes or those exploitative merchants... Bad people always come with bad karma.	1																					
40	36		301								Changyu	I've seen so many of them on this shitty boat—stinking, corrupted trash that poisons the place and hurts everyone around them. But karma is karma—when I come collecting, the gods will be on my side.	1																					
41	240		204							1	1																							
42	37		301								Changyu	Then all it takes is a bit of planning, a little bit of luck. Everything goes my way.	1																					
43	250		204							1	5																							
44	38		301								Changyu	I'm no hero, but even I can't stand these bullies. And if good people can't do anything about it, maybe it takes a bad guy like me to take out the trash. That I can live by.	1																					
45	39		204							1	1																							
46	40		301								Changyu	That's why this is going to work.	1																					
47	41		301								Changyu	...Because Akdilek hurt you, didn't they?	1

50	44		301									Changyu's voice gets quieter and quieter until he turns silent and withholds the last line. Huainan raises his brows.																						
51	45		301								Huainan	What?	2																					
52	46		301								Changyu	Your turn. What do you wish for?	1

62	54		301									Changyu is about to protest, but then he suddenly bursts out laughing.																						
63	55		301								Changyu	Oh my, it's been a while since I eat noodles with someone else face-to-face, like some sort of celebration.	1																					
64	56		301								Huainan	You made it sound like we just had our last meals...	2																					
65	57		301								Changyu	Knock on wood! Shut it—that mouth hole of yours gonna take away our luck!	1																					
66	58		301								Changyu	The gods are already on our side. Why else do you think my T-193 affinity matches the trade requirement? Just make sure you have my back outside the venue when things kick off.	1																					
67	59		301								Huainan	...Fine. If only my affinity also matches.	2																					
68	60		301								Changyu	It's all going to work out. Don't worry!	1

76	68		301									Night arrives outside their windowpane. The bustling streets mimic the flickering neon above, and in the space between them, a dream-like sequence of light and shadow plays out on the tavern wall.																						
77	69		301									Laughter and cries can be heard in the distance where sky lanterns take to the sky. Through their window, the Nighter is nothing but an extravagant show of shadow puppetry, unreal and untethered.																						
78	70		301								Huainan	Changyu... I want to ask you something. Be honest with me.																						
79	71		301								Changyu	Shoot. Unless you're asking for the password of my bank account.																						
80	72		301								Huainan	...Do you have a bank account?																						
81	73		301								Changyu	Fine! You got me. No, I don't.																						
82	74		301								Changyu	Alright, what's the question?																						
83	75		301								Huainan	Have you heard of the "Butterfly Dream"?																						
84	76		301								Changyu	Hmm... I think so. Some guy named Zhuangzi dreamt of a butterfly, and he couldn't figure out if it had been him who'd dreamed of it, or if it had been the butterfly who'd dreamed of him.																						
85	77		301								Huainan	Let's say—hypothetically—this world you're living in was an illusion. Would you want to escape it?																						
86	78		301								Changyu	Why am I not surprised you'd ask something like that?																						
87	79		301								Changyu	But for me... All that matters is what's here and now.																						
88	80		301								Changyu	Not that I can't tell how much you're skeptical of this boat...																						
89	81		301								Changyu	Well, what does it matter if it's real or not? Isn't being happy enough?																						
90	82		301								Changyu	Because it's not what you're feeling, but the feeling itself, that makes a thing authentic.																						
91	83		301								Changyu	There's no way we can tell if the world is real as long as we are in it. If we keep second-guessing the ground we walk on every step of the way, we'll never go anywhere.																						
92	280		301								Changyu	We don't hope to live—we live with hope. Maybe someday the Punishing Virus will be gone, and we'll all return to the outside world. That's a nice hope to live for, isn't it?																						
93	84		301								Changyu	Punishing Virus. Been a while since I've thought about it.																						
94	85		301								Huainan	A while, huh?																						
95	86		301								Huainan	It's very you, the way you answered it.																						
96	87		301								Changyu	Enough about me. How about you?																						
97	88		301									Huainan does not answer. Lights and shadows mask his face, concealing his thoughts from Changyu.																						
98	89		301									In the silence, the old movie on the television sounds especially loud.																						
99	90		301								Old Movie	"...You ever had a dream like that?"																						
100	91		301								Huainan	...I won't allow myself to be stuck in a dream.																						
101	92		301								Old Movie	"And you dare treatin' it other than an illusion."																						
102	93		301								Huainan	It's suicide, being trapped in an illusion. What's the point of living if none of it is real?																						
103	94		301								Old Movie	"If you don't wake up, how can you tell what is real, and..."																						
104	95		301								Huainan	I despise it, your "hope." It's just another lie that distracts us from our suffering. So I'll do what needs to be done if it means waking up from this damn dream.
