6	6		301			DialogEnable				1	Lee	That's one trial passed... but now we've got more questions.	3																					
7	1001		302								The key with the portrait of a Construct.	7																						
8	7		301								Lee	That's right. I thought it would just be a normal key, but I wasn't expecting a portrait on it.	3																					
9	8		301								Liv	Do you think it means anything?	1																					
10	9		301								Lee	We should first figure out why these mechanoids would make a stamp like this...	3																					
11	1002		302								The supply crates.	10	Maybe they know us?	11																				
12	10	12	301								Lee	It's probably the most sensible deduction, assuming they found out about us after going through the supply crates.	3																					
13	11	12	301								Lee	Not very possible.	3																					
14	12		301								Lucia	But stamping the portrait on them has to be a message.	2																					
15	13		301								Lucia	I'm guessing it has something to do with the ghost-hunting part of the event. Maybe the person on the key would come to our assistance or something.	2																					
16	14		301								Lee	Or the person is the target of the hunt...	3																					
17	15		301								Lucia	Either way, having this key means we can access the ghost-hunting venue, albeit only one of the areas. I think Commandant should give it a go.	2																					
18	1003		302								I've tried it already.	16	Let's do it later.	17																				
19	16	18	301								Lee	Was that why you were gone just now...?	3																					
20	17	18	301								Lucia	Understood. We'll leave that decision to you, Commandant.	2																					
21	18		301								Liv	The second trial is up ahead. I wonder what it is...	1																					
22	19		301			RImgBg1Shake					???	I hear somebody calling for the South General!

31	22		301			RImgBg1Shake						You dodge just in time thanks to Lucia's warning, but you still cannot escape the impact from whatever is hitting the ground.

33	23		301							1	South General	Ho ho ho! South General, at your service! Aspirants of wisdom, were you the ones who call for me?	1																					
34	1011		302								We weren't.	24	We're just looking for the second trial.	24																				
35	24		301								South General	It was you indeed! Ho ho ho!	1

37	25		301							1	Lee	...This guy's just making a speech.	1																					
38	1013		201							1	500170																							
39	26		301							1	South General	I'm sure that you would know it requires more than simply perception to expose a ghost! It also takes the wisdom of improvising according to your circumstances!	1

42	27		301							1	Lucia	So the second trial is a trial of wisdom?	2																					
43	28		301								South General	The wisdom to "improvise," that is.	1

46	29		301							1	Lee	You're really emphasizing that word, aren't you? How about let me tackle this one, Commandant?	1																					
47	1018		302								Of course.	1019																						
48	1019		201							1	500170																							
49	30		301							1	South General	Ho ho ho, a challenger approaches!	1																					
50	31		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				South General	Let the trial begin! Scene change!	1
