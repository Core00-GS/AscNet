22	22		301									Everything is plunged into boundless darkness all of a sudden. Your eyes adjust themselves to sense the dim light.																						
23	23		301									Then, as you regain your senses, you can finally move your limbs again.																						
24	24		301			RImgBg1Shake						Your eyes are sore and your nose is stuffy. Blades of grass caress your cheeks. Your hands feel the touch of soil and rubble.																						
25	25		301									So, you start commanding your heavy limbs. With two hands and two knees on the ground, you struggle to push yourself up.																						
26	26		301									Your physical senses grow stronger as they remind you of the new world around you.

29	29		301									And as you take a look around, everything is unveiled as if the curtain on the stage is lifted. Everything starts moving as you hear a mysterious melody that is mesmerizing and clear.																						
30	30		301									The forest is dark and there is no one in sight. There is strange light blinking above the sky. The shadow of a dragon emerges from a cloud before disappearing into another one. It strikes fear into your heart.																						
31	31		301									The mysterious melody echoes across the land as if a whistle guiding a hound. It snatches your soul as you realize it is the pipe.																						
32	32		301									Just like the Magic Pipe of Hamelin and treacherous sorcery, it skillfully guides the evil dragon as the dragon flies and turns, bringing desolation upon the land.

37	37		301									The startled white-billed crows return to perch on branches high up in the air. As the air current disperses, everything goes back to silence.																						
38	38		301									And why are you here?																						
39	39		301									You have no knowledge or possessions. There is no one by your side and no traces to track you down with.																						
40	40		301									Who is playing the pipe of doom and guiding the dragon again? Who is bringing calamity and blocking the way forward?

45	45		301									The veins around your temples pulse as blurred memories pour into your mind like a whale emerging from the sea surface and quickly falling back to send a huge wave. Your heart is ravaged and your feelings are a mess. Nothing feels real. It is almost like you are sharing an illusion with someone.																						
46	46		301									Suddenly, you feel weary as if you have been through a long journey or a long battle only to end up going back to where you started.																						
47	47		301									Then, you recall your original goal. You want to go home.																						
48	48		301									But before that can happen—before old things wither and new things are born—you must escape this forest.
