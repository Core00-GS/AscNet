33	32		301								α	What is it?	2																					
34	33		301								Luna	Think of it as a catalyst.	1																					
35	34		301								Luna	When I first became an agent... I didn't understand its true nature and thought the voices were telling the truth.	1

43	42		301								Luna	Of course, this is just a simplified analogy. It's actually more complicated than that.	1																					
44	43		301								Luna	There have also been many Constructs recently who opt to simulate an injury like this to temporarily augment their power.	1

49	48		301								α	Then let me be frank with you. I have no interest.	2

101	104		301								Luna	Of course, that person will become a monster, just like the evil king, but so what?	1																					
102	105		301								Luna	"Monster" is but a term defined by human standards. If seeing the filtering through means I'll be called a monster, I'll treat it as my crowning glory.	1																					
103	106		301								α	Will you want others to survive?	2																					
104	107		301								Luna	Of course.	1																					
105	108		204							1																								
106	109		301								Luna	Even if I become a nefarious villain in the eyes of the humans, a villain needs people to be subjected to their villainous deeds.	1																					
107	110		301								Luna	Not only is this wish mine, but it's also the very purpose behind Ascnet's filtering process. That's why I have to complete Ascnet's mission.	1																					
108	111		301								Luna	But the humans who are still flesh and blood, with their deep-seated prejudice, aren't able to even pass the preliminary filtering process by the Punishing Virus.	1

112	115		301							1	Luna	Perhaps...	1

115	118		301									Even as an agent, Luna does not think highly of humanity.

136	139		301								Lamia	They had their comrade blow himself up?	3

148	151		301								Gabriel	Even after sustaining such huge losses last time, the humans still aren't giving up on trying to get a glimpse of the secrets of the Ascension-Network.	2																					
149	152		301								Gabriel	What are they really after?	2																					
150	153		301								Roland	Perhaps they wish to make their Constructs immune to the Punishing Virus and instead, have their bodies augmented by it, just like an Ascendant? Or maybe they simply want to be able to control an Ascendant, or even an agent...	1																					
151	154		301								Roland	There is so much they can gain from it. They are the puppet masters, having their underlings kill one another while they reap the benefits. That's their modus operandi.	1																					
152	155		301								Roland	Although I still don't know what exactly they want, or how close they are to their goal. But things seem to be going according to plan, aren't they?	1

154	157		201							1	500238	5

161	164		301								Gabriel	Miss Luna wants us to keep increasing our numbers to deal with the losses.	2																					
162	165		301								Gabriel	Appropriate seeds must be found as soon as possible. For those who aren't yet aware or don't have the necessary conditions to pass the filtering, we'll have to create those conditions.	2																					
163	166		301								Gabriel	If we can get ultimate power that is impervious to these despicable ploys, there won't be any more humans standing in the way of the Network's mission.	2

168	171		301									Such things have become a normal part of their daily lives.																						
169	172		301									The humans' offensives last too long, just like the winds blowing through the abyss, and just as relentless.																						
170	173		301									In comparison, being betrayed and abandoned back then was but the first step into the abyss.																						
171	174		301									And the hatred that inundated them was born from being hunted down and rounded up. Even more so from unexpected traps and conspiracies. Each drop of hate pooling together until it formed a river that flowed into the bottom of the abyss.																						
172	175		301									At first, it was just the usual ambushes and raids.																						
173	176		301									But soon, there was a chance of "gifts" being hidden close to the seeds they approached.																						
174	177		301									In this battle of wits, every attempt to throw the humans off their trail unintentionally provides them with ideas for improvement.																						
175	178		301									As a result, their methods have become more subtle and nastier with each iteration.																						
176	179		301									But for the Ascendants and those on a similar path, the memories hidden within their M.I.N.D. are filled with this torment.																						
177	180		301									These experiences are like layers of wounds inflicted on top of one another.

206	208		301							1	Gabriel	This device was brought over from the Arctic Route Union.	1																					
207	209		301								Gabriel	A new military post's been set up to the east. It's very well-hidden and there are similar devices within. There are also a few researchers stationed there.	1

213	215		201							1	500100																							
214	216		301							1	α	Either they had been deliberately hiding something, or someone has shared the devices and technology with them.	1																					
215	217		301								α	But there's a greater likelihood that it was a combination of the two.	1																					
216	218		301								α	The local residents may not be aware of this, but there is a secret hidden beneath this snowfield.	1																					
217	219		301								α	And it's because they are inherently capable that they've received visitors who want to share their technology and devices with them.	1																					
218	220		201							1	500008	4																						
219	221		301							1	Roland	In other words, the Arctic Route Union is working with that group from before?	1

225	227		301							1	α	A large number of Corrupted emerged from the sea some time back, and the Forest Guard lack the power to hold them back. As a result, they sustained some losses.	1																					
226	228		301								α	I'd hazard a guess and say they agreed to work together in exchange for materials.	1																					
227	229		301								α	There aren't many large human bases on Earth these days, and even fewer are willing to take part in a plan against the Ascendants.	1																					
228	230		301								α	They must be hiding something we don't know about. They wouldn't take such a huge risk otherwise, no matter how generous the reward.	1																					
229	231		201							1	500008																							
230	232		301							1	Roland	The military post seems to be merely a symbol of their cooperation. There must be another hidden facility.	1

239	241		201							1	500100

317	317		301								Murol	But the higher-ups said that they had to activate us at all costs so as to investigate what happened then.	1																					
318	318		301								Murol	However, they haven't been able to solve version issue, and with the lack of manpower, they had no choice but to sign some contract with the humans on Earth and rope them in to help.	1
