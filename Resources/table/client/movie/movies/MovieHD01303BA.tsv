5	5		302								A scavenger hunt seems fun.	6																						
6	6		301									After setting a time to meet up, Lee decides to go on a scavenger hunt held throughout the venue. According to the introduction, first place wins a bunch of Star Tickets.																						
7	7		302								Also...	8																						
8	8		302								It says they recommended teams of two.	9																						
9	9		301									You point at the flyer.																						
10	10		301								Lee	I can do it myself.	1																					
11	11		302								But...	12																						
12	12		302								This game requires a good sense of direction!	13																						
13	13		204							1	6																							
14	14		301								Lee	Shut up!	1																					
15	15		204							1	8																							
16	16		301								Lee	...	1																					
17	17		204							1																								
18	18		301								Lee	If you're going to join me, then we have to get first place.	1																					
19	19		302								You betcha!	20	This sure is tough...	20																				
20	20		301									Without saying another word, you and Lee walk to the registration area.																						
21	21		301									After arriving at the event area, a staff hands you a flyer with a list of rules for the scavenger hunt.																						
22	22		301								Lee	Looking for mechanical parts... sensors... Pretty creative.	1																					
23	23		301								Lee	Well then, let's choose the hardest one.	1																					
24	24		202							1					1																			
25	25		301									You offer no objection.																						
26	26		301									Since teams of two are allowed to participate, your bonds as Gray Raven will be essential to winning. Right as you are about to plot your course, you hear someone greet you from behind.

28	28		301							1	Construct A	Oh? Gray Raven?	1																					
29	29		301									Turning around, you see members of the Engineering Force stationed here in the conservation area.																						
30	30		301									With the reputation of Gray Raven, it is no surprise you are recognized even after changing your attire.																						
31	31		302								Hello.	32

34	34		301							1	Construct B	Is your team on a mission?	2																					
35	35		302								We're on holiday.	36																						
36	36		301								Construct A	Of course. There hasn't been any Corrupted active nearby lately.	1																					
37	37		301								Construct A	The celebration sure is full of excitement. I haven't seen the people here this happy in a long time.	1																					
38	38		301								Construct B	Are you guys participating in the scavenger hunt? I wouldn't bother if I were you.	2																					
39	39		301								Construct B	With how long the Engineering Force has been stationed here, we know this place inside and out. Need I say any more?	2																					
40	40		302								I like a challenge.	41																						
41	41		301								Construct A	Then how about a friendly competition?	1																					
42	42		301								Construct A	Beating Gray Raven would sure get us some clout back home.	1																					
43	43		302								You're on.	44

45	45		301									Raising the stakes has surly made this game interesting.																						
46	46		301									The difficulty of this game is not only in finding the small parts but also telling them apart from similar components.																						
47	47		301									However, when it comes to knowledge of machine parts, almost everyone in the Engineering Force is an expert.																						
48	48		201							1	500489																							
49	49		301							1	Lee	I'll carry the sensor and transmit the radar signal to your terminal.	1																					
50	50		301								Lee	You'll be responsible for finding the right location.	1																					
51	51		301									But Gray Raven has their "expert," too.																						
52	52		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				Leave it to me.	53
