6	6		301								Guard Leader	But is it really a good idea to take advantage of their tests to get Babylonia's new device to help clear out the Corrupted nearby?	2

12	12		301									A fallen Corrupted suddenly rises and sprints toward Watanabe at inhuman speed.																						
13	13		401							2	1506																							
14	14		301									But its head is immediately crushed a few steps out—the CUB goes in and stomps for two more strikes, completely shattering the Corrupted into pieces before swiftly returning to Watanabe's side.

16	16		301							1	Watanabe	Hmm, good job...	1

20	20		301							1	Patrol Leader	Hey, is it just me, or is Mr. Watanabe being much gentler to the metal critter than he is to us?	1																					
21	21		301								Guard Leader	Damn... Stop it. You're gonna make me cry.	2																					
22	22		301									All of a sudden, the CUB raises its head and takes a quick scan of the surrounding before running off in a direction.																						
23	23		301								Patrol Leader	Is that a joke? Don't tell me it's broken already, running off like that...	1																					
24	24		202							1	2				1

33	33		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Hearing the location Watanabe says, all the Forsaken soldiers jump to their feet and hop on their vehicles, speeding behind the CUB without delay.

36	36		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						After Watanabe departs the campsite, the children turn their attention to you, a stranger from Babylonia.																						
37	37		301									Before the boys can act, the previously timid-looking girl walks up to you.																						
38	38		201							1	500280																							
39	39		301							1	Ann	【kuroname】, is it? Nice to meet you, we are the members of the Forsaken Reserves K-107 Squad One—	1																					
40	40		302								107?	41	Reserves?	41																				
41	41		301								Ann	K-107, that's right! Once we grow up, we will graduate into the proper 107 Squad!	1																					
42	42		301								Ann	Anyway, before Uncle—I mean, before Chief Watanabe returns, we will be accompanying you at our campsite.	1																					
43	43		301								Ann	No need to worry. We'll keep you safe.	1																					
44	44		302							698	I appreciate it.	49	I'll do the same.	50

50	50		301							1	Deckard	Wonderful! Let's act together, then!	3																					
51	51		301								Ann	In that case... let's continue our previous operation. But now that we have 【kuroname】 with us...	1																					
52	52		301								Xiuyong	We're asking 【kuroname】 to join us now? But we're almost done...	2																					
53	53		301								Deckard	But we'll kill two birds with one stone while also getting to keep an eye on the supplier!	3																					
54	54		301								Xiuyong	Isn't keeping an eye on the supplier the other bird?	2																					
55	55		301								Ann	...Maybe? Not that we can do it any other way!	1																					
56	56		301									The three youthful faces turn serious again. They put their heads together, discussing secretly.																						
57	57		301									By the time they talk to you again, they seem to have come to a consensus among themselves, and they look at you with anticipation and barely hidden excitement.																						
58	58		301								Xiuyong	Here—take this.	2																					
59	59		301									The boy reaches his hand out proudly, and in his palm is a poorly made lantern.																						
60	60		301									Its rough edges are even more noticeable being in a child's hand.																						
61	61		301								Xiuyong	We've been preparing this.	2																					
62	62		301								Ann	Exactly... For Uncle Watanabe and his troop!	1																					
63	63		302								It's cute.	64	But why?	65																				
64	64	66	301								Ann	Hmph! It's my idea, after all!	1																					
65	65		301								Deckard	For decoration, obviously!	3																					
66	66		301								Xiuyong	Think about it—Uncle Watanabe just left with his men, right?	2																					
67	67		301								Xiuyong	We hang this at the entrance of the campsite, and when the squad returns, they'll open the gate and find—	2																					
68	68		301								Ann	Hey, don't say it out loud! You know we aren't allowed near the entrance outside the camp!	1																					
69	69		301								Deckard	What are you so afraid of? We know they're not here.	3																					
70	70		301								Ann	...And you just have to spoil it! What good does it do if our mission objective knows we can't go near it?!	1																					
71	71		301								Ann	You two bozos!	1																					
72	72		301								Xiuyong	It's fine! We're just decorating! Nothing will go wrong with an extra pair of hands!	2																					
73	73		301								Xiuyong	We can even manage our time better while keeping 【kuroname】 in our line of sight!	2																					
74	74		302								Are you making me an accomplice?	75																						
75	75		301								Xiuyong	Accomplice? No!	2																					
76	76		301								Xiuyong	You're the reason Uncle Watanabe and his squad are out at this time of the year—	2																					
77	77		301								Deckard	And we got an extra mission because of you!	3																					
78	78		301								Xiuyong	You aren't an accomplice—you're guilty! Helping us is the least you can do!	2																					
79	79		301									The two boys mean business, and they leave you no room for refusal.																						
80	80		301									And the girl behind them has already laid out all the things she packed earlier, tallying everything carefully.																						
81	81		301								Ann	...It's too late to split up now. We have to take the supplier with us.	1																					
82	82		301								Xiuyong	Just... to do what, exactly? Decorations... lanterns?	2																					
83	83		301								Ann	Our next step is to clear out the trash near the entrance, then put our preparations to good use.	1																					
84	84		301									As she finishes, she divides the decorations in front of her into three parts and hands one to each of you.																						
85	85		301								Ann	...So, "supplier," do you also make New Year decorations, like, at the place you're from?																						
86	86		302								Of course.	87	I'm not sure...	88																				
87	87	89	301								Ann	I knew it!	1																					
88	88		301								Ann	That's surprising...	1																					
89	89		301								Ann	It'll be too sad to not even have something like this...	1																					
90	90		301									She lowers her head and thinks for a while.																						
91	91		301								Ann	Um... We've made so many already, so what's one more? It'll be our payment to you once we're done decorating!	1																					
92	92		302		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				I look forward to it.
