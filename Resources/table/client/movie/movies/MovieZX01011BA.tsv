15	15		301							1	Bianca	I only changed into a frame that's more suitable for this situation, do not be alarmed.	1																					
16	16		302								Are you here to help?	17	Where's Lee?	18																				
17	17	20	301								Bianca	Your commands, please, Commandant of Gray Raven.	1																					
18	18		201							1	1021001	3																						
19	19		301							1	Lucia	Sorry, we were deployed in different directions and didn't have time to meet up, but I was able to sense Lee's signal all this time, so he should be fine.	1																					
20	20		201							1	500125	2																						
21	21		301							1	Jamilah	...So you're the one Babylonia sent to make the deal?	1																					
22	22		204							1	4																							
23	23		301								Jamilah	I'd like to welcome you if I could, but as you can see, you came at a rather inconvenient timing.	1																					
24	24		201							1	500128																							
25	25		301							1	Bianca	I noticed, looks like I've entered at the wrong time... You were saying? Don't mind me, please continue.	1

34	34		301							1	Bianca	Babylonia has agreed to Akdilek's terms.	1

45	45		204							1	5																							
46	46		301								Sophia	No, I will not back down no matter what. I am a part of Akdilek, so I can be a good merchant too!	1

48	48		301									Sophia makes up her mind and pulls out her gunâ€”																						
49	49		301									Before anyone can react, she places the gun on the floor where anyone can reach.																						
50	50		201							1	1031001	7

52	52		201							1	500127	5																						
53	53		301							1	Sophia	I'm not familiar with negotiations, so if anyone disagrees with me, they are welcome to execute me with this gun afterward and continue your quarreling.	1																					
54	54		204							1																								
55	55		301								Sophia	With that said... Leader, Lord Ashlar, and everyone here, no matter aristocrats or commoners, I want to propose a trade to you all!	1																					
56	56		201							1	500125	2																						
57	57		301							1	Jamilah	And what kind of trade would that be?	1																					
58	58		201							1	500127																							
59	59		301							1	Sophia	I may not know how to achieve it right now, but I'll create a world that doesn't need this train or Babylonia.	1																					
60	60		201							1	500129																							
61	61		301							1	Ashlar	You must be joking... Without the train and without Babylonia, everyone would be infected by the Punishing...	1																					
62	62		201							1	500127																							
63	63		301							1	Sophia	They won't.	1

66	66		201							1	500127	5																						
67	67		301							1	Sophia	I don't know how to make it a reality yet, but I will succeed. I don't want to hide in that lonely space nor do I want to become an Ascendant.	1																					
68	68		204							1																								
69	69		301								Sophia	I only wish to be able to protect the things I want to protect, to protect all of Akdilek. So let's make a deal!	1																					
70	70		301								Sophia	I will create a real final destination for everyone, not a fake one where you just accept what comes.	1																					
71	71		301								Sophia	But one where we walk this Earth again with our own strength!	1																					
72	72		201							1	500129

75	75		301							1	Changyu	No... I find it quite interesting, don't you?	1

79	79	81	301								Changyu	I only fainted earlier due to exhaustion, no need for you to worry.	1

81	81		201							1	500126	8	-600																					
82	82		301							1	Aston	Leader, since Babylonia has already gone through with our deal, we should stick to our original plan...	1																					
83	83		201							1	500129		600																					
84	84		301							1	Ashlar	We should continue on with our original deal here, what the brat's saying here is just...	1

86	86		201							3	500125	2																						
87	87		301							1	Jamilah	She proposed this trade to all of Akdilek, not just a specific person, so this decision is in the hands of everyone. Everyone has a right to choose. So what do you think, people of Akdilek? Who do you want to support?	3																					
88	88		202							1	2	3			1																			
89	89		301								Commoner A	O-of course Sophia!! She's one of us so she understands our situation!																						
90	90		301								Aristocrat A	We should just settle for going to Babylonia, and not make some gibberish deal... Who gave Constructs the right to speak up anyway...																						
91	91		301								Commoner B	If we commoners get to choose too, then I choose Sophia! She's saved me before too...																						
92	92		301								Aristocrat B	Now that I think about it, the Ascendants never guaranteed to make us Ascendants... And they look like they're up to no good...																						
93	93		301								Aristocrat A	Walking on Earth again with our own power... If only it was that easy...																						
94	94		301								Agitated Commoner	We can't run forever! I'd rather fight for my future with my own two hands than rely on some unknown source.																						
95	95		301								Whispering Aristocrats	They have a point... She's a Construct, maybe she really is that strong...																						
96	96		201							1	500129																							
97	97		301							1	Ashlar	Preposterous, both the aristocrats and commoners...	1																					
98	98		201							1	500125	13																						
99	99		301							1	Jamilah	Sophia, do you still remember our conversation from before? What should you do to ensure a larger profit when making a deal?	1

101	101		201							2	500127		400

105	105		204							1	1																							
106	106		301								Jamilah	And that, is the final answer from me and my fellow merchants.	1																					
107	107		302								Let's take the first step then.	108	Then let's go get the merchandise.	108																				
108	108		201							1	500127
