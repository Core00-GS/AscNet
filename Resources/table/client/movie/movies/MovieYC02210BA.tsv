10	10		301								Roland	They were the only variables to have any direct effect on "Mother". As you can see, "Mother" has had an emotional fluctuation similar to fear for the first time.	1																					
11	11		301								Roland	Only when it knows what fear is, can we know it's evolving in the right direction.	1																					
12	12		301								Cinderelik	...	2																					
13	13		301								Roland	They still haven't left the sensory range of "Mother". Don't you want to know what kind of stimulation can be generated by the only surviving variables so far?	1																					
14	14		301								Roland	It'd be a shame to let such precious samples die so soon.	1																					
15	15		301								Roland	...Think of it as an encore. I'm also curious to see how far they can make it. It's much more interesting than those dramas in the tower, isn't it?	1																					
16	16		301									Cinderelik furrows her eyebrows faintly.																						
17	17		301								Cinderelik	This isn't a part of the plan.	2																					
18	18		301								Cinderelik	Report this to der Meister. Let him make the final decision.	2

27	27		301							1	Vonnegut	How's the situation?	1																					
28	28		301									Roland leans to one side, arms folded, and looks at Cinderelik leisurely as he awaits her to brief Vonnegut on the current situation.																						
29	29		301								Cinderelik	...My negligence resulted in the centrifuge arrays that provided "Mother" with nutrition being destroyed.	2																					
30	30		301								Cinderelik	Without a constant supply of Punishing Virus, "Mother" has grown considerably weaker than before.	2																					
31	31		301								Cinderelik	Without human interference, "Mother" would've completed the task by now.	2																					
32	32		301								Vonnegut	Is that so?	1																					
33	33		301									Vonnegut doesn't show any sign of anger upon hearing the sudden change of events. He only raises his eyebrows out of interest.																						
34	34		301								Cinderelik	I tried to repair the centrifuge arrays to ensure that the CPF can complete the final Punishing supply despite the low power.	2																					
35	35		301								Cinderelik	Incubation has been postponed. Also...	2																					
36	36		301								Cinderelik	Under incomplete conditions, the "things" in the "Mother's" body may have unpredictable defects.	2																					
37	37		301								Vonnegut	No matter. You've done well.	1																					
38	38		301								Vonnegut	You and "Mother" have completed your mission with flying colors.	1																					
39	39		301								Vonnegut	And Roland, thank you for your efforts. I'll hold up my end of the bargain.	1

41	41		301							1	Roland	Thank you.	2																					
42	42		301								Vonnegut	Babylonia has found the location of "Mother", and they've sent their Construct forces to investigate. Take all the research materials and evacuate as soon as possible.	1

44	44		301							1	Cinderelik	But...	2																					
45	45		301								Vonnegut	I'm afraid that Gray Raven will be joining them. Are you confident you can win without any consumption?	1																					
46	46		301								Vonnegut	We have more important matters to tend to.	1																					
47	47		301								Cinderelik	I...	2																					
48	48		301								Cinderelik	Understood.	2																					
49	49		301								Vonnegut	Good girl.	1																					
50	50		301								Vonnegut	As for your "Mother", don't worry. Her time will come.	1																					
51	51		301								Vonnegut	Since the incubation of "Mother" will be delayed, it's better to have Babylonia's troops be "its" last guests.	1																					
52	52		301								Vonnegut	Set the stage for the final act. Return to my side and witness it with me.	1

70	70		301									The Scavenger's consciousness ebbs and flows in the chaos. The pale and dangerous strange girl, the mysterious liar, the wailing from near to far, the pulsating bright red numbers, and the black and red light flickering in front of them...																						
71	71		301									Oh, right. He shut down the CPF's power to prevent the monsters from taking it over.																						
72	72		301									Even with the power shut down as much as he could, the monster could not be stopped from growing.																						
73	73		301									After losing most of the Punishing supply, "Mother" seems to have fallen into temporary chaos while hanging from the top of the tower. The scarlet umbilical cords swing wildly in the air. Some have even withered. After struggling for a moment, they become paralyzed and unable to move.																						
74	74		301									However, not only are the Hetero-Plants unable to move, having withered from the loss of nutrients, Zack was unable to move either.																						
75	75		301									Zack's body has decayed too far for him to even stand up.																						
76	76		301									He raises his hand. The festering has spread from his cuffs. Pus and blood soak the cloth wrapped around his hands.																						
77	77		301									Looking through the gap in his fingers, the Scavenger sees the shell off in the distance.																						
78	78		301									In the gap of the black shell, the clear outline of a shadow gradually emerges from the red interior.																						
79	79		301									A strange feeling rises in the Scavenger's mind. This kind of vision, which is as if there is nothing, sticks to his whole body. He feels something staring at him through the chaos.																						
80	80		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStory/FxUiStoryBianHong.prefab	2																							
81	81		301									His vision is gradually stained with a bright red. So close to seeing what is staring at him in the shell.

84	84		301									Suddenly, it turns dark before him as if the bloody world is covered with a dense shadow.																						
85	85		301								Roland	There you are.																						
86	86		301									Someone stands in front of the Scavenger. He opens his bloodshot eyes. The optic nerves suppressed by the virus make him unable to discern the figure in front of him.																						
87	87		301								Roland	How pitiful...																						
88	88		301									His voice carries the sound of frivolous laughter as if the misery in front of him is something he was used to.																						
89	89		301								Roland	Poor human. If only you were a Construct...																						
90	90		301								Roland	I would've been able to save you.																						
91	91		301								Zack	You... Rolmo...																						
92	92		301								Roland	I'm surprised. I didn't think you would be able to tell who I am.																						
93	93		301								Roland	Your friends have already left you.																						
94	94		301								Zack	Really...?																						
95	95		301									The Scavenger puts his hand deep into the backpack and fumbles for quite some time. Finally, he pulls out a vial of serum.																						
96	96		301								Zack	If you see them... give them this... Please...																						
97	97		301								Zack	Cough... They're... running low on supplies...																						
98	98		301								Roland	If I remember correctly, Kordes is in charge of carrying your group's medical supplies.																						
99	99		301								Zack	Heh... This one I kept for myself... We all did... Just in case.																						
100	100		301								Zack	So... If we're separated during an accident, we at least know the others will survive.																						
101	101		301								Zack	I'm hopeless. They should've taken this while they had the chance.																						
102	102		301								Roland	But I'm the villain who deceived you. What makes you think you can believe me?																						
103	103		301								Zack	I saw you save them... I don't know why you did it... But you did...																						
104	104		301								Zack	There's no hope for me... It's better for you to carry it than for it to rot with me.																						
105	105		301								Zack	And I don't have a chance... to know what kind of person you really are.																						
106	106		301									Roland looks at Zack with a blank expression.																						
107	107		301									While searching for "new recruits," many Constructs had reached their hand out much in the same way in desperation to survive before being devoured by the virus.																						
108	108		301									Roland, the actor, had seen countless tragic plays, and Roland, the Ascendant, has experienced countless tragic realities.																						
109	109		301									This time, the human also reaches out with a strong desire to live, but he is asking him to save others instead.																						
110	110		301									Is this a trick to win pity? Or does the truth come out in one's dying breath?																						
111	111		301								Zack	...I just want everyone to live.																						
112	112		301								Zack	I just wanted to get as much supplies as possible until we find a place where we can live—a place where Kordus can plant his blue hydrangea and watch them sprout into beautiful flowers.																						
113	113		301								Zack	Maybe we could've found out the whereabouts of his daughter in that conservation area...																						
114	114		301								Zack	We wouldn't have to wander around because of the virus and get into ridiculous disputes anymore...																						
115	115		301								Zack	"Beardy" wouldn't have to... try and cheer us up anymore...																						
116	116		301									Tears spill out of his eyes as he trembles with pain.																						
117	117		301								Roland	...																						
118	118		301									The Scavenger's voice is so weak, it almost disappears among the roar of the tower.																						
119	119		301								Roland	You mentioned that movie.																						
120	120		301								Roland	Want to know how it ends?																						
121	121		301								Roland	The brave knight reaches the top of the tower. He finds out that the place where the secret treasure should have been is empty, and the knight dies of despair. At least, that's how it should've ended. But the lead actor of the film didn't agree with the script.																						
122	122		301								Roland	At that time, he was so naive that people laughed at him. He believed that people could achieve happiness on their own accord.																						
123	123		301								Roland	He said that reality is bitter enough. Why film a tragedy that will only break the audience's heart?																						
124	124		301								Roland	So he convinced the director to change the ending.																						
125	125		301								Roland	Right as the knight is about to be engulfed by despair, the god sleeping in the tower finally wakes up. He witnesses the hope, struggle and despair of the knight, and realizes that there is such a powerful force in the hearts of humanity—whom he once viewed as weak.																						
126	126		301									Roland's voice is quiet and calm, like he is intimately familiar with this story.																						
127	127		301								Roland	So the god gives humanity the kindling of hope and tells humanity that the disaster would one day pass.																						
128	128		301								Zack	That's... a better ending...																						
129	129		301								Roland	Isn't it ridiculous? He can't even control his own destiny, but he wants to change the fate of a fake character. What's the meaning of this?																						
130	130		301								Zack	Meaning...																						
131	131		301								Zack	Of course, I know it's fake... But I really liked... that he never gave up.																						
132	132		301								Zack	Isn't that... the point of a movie?																						
133	133		301								Zack	As long as someone performs a role and people watch it, the role... will live on in the hearts of the audience.																						
134	134		301								Zack	As long as the feelings at that moment are real, what difference does it make if it's all an act?																						
135	135		301								Roland	...																						
136	136		301									Zack's entire body is gradually rotting due to the virus, but there's a faint smile in the corners of his mouth.																						
137	137		301									Right as his life is drawing to an end, he recalls the distant memories of what he had seen and heard during his journeys, casually chatting in front of weathered and broken posters, a movie hiding quietly in his backpack, and the afternoons he would watch them with his family.																						
138	138		301								Zack	...What I've done... is absolutely not... meaningless...

143	143		301									Roland squats down and takes the vial from the Scavenger.																						
144	144		301								Roland	I'm not sure if I'll see your friends again, but this serum will play its role as you said.																						
145	145		301								Roland	I rarely make promises, but this time you can trust me.

148	148		301							1	Zack	...Thank you.																						
149	149		301								Roland	You're welcome. It's rare for someone to believe me for a change. What an interesting feeling. Usually, everyone believes my lies, but nobody wants to believe my truths.	1																					
150	150		301									Blood slowly overflows out of Zack's ears, and his organs are rapidly failing. He can no longer hear what the person in front of him is saying.																						
151	151		301								Roland	...	1																					
152	152		301								Roland	Not to mention, consider this as the final gift for the "audience" who still remembers "me."	1																					
153	153		301									When Roland utters the last sentence, which is almost a murmur, the Scavenger hears nothing. With his hand still held out, he stops breathing.																						
154	154		301									A twisted and strange cry comes from all parts of the tower, like a nightmare that can never be woken up from. Roland looks up at the shell hanging from the top of the tower.

166	166		301									Kordes and "Beardy" support each other as they walk through the seemingly endless forest.																						
167	167		301									The CPF behind them has been completely occupied by the glowing red plants, becoming a giant tree pointing directly into the sky. The white signs that once guided them have been completely covered, and they can no longer distinguish the location of the CPF.																						
168	168		301									Something is quietly incubating in the CPF, waiting patiently to be delivered.																						
169	169		301									This CPF, which was once the hope of Scavengers for survival, has become an eternal nightmare in their hearts.																						
170	170		301									This CPF, which was once the hope of humanity for survival, has become a hotbed of human suffering.																						
171	171		301									The strange cries of humanoid monsters come from the jungle. They can even pick out Zack's voice from the rising and falling calls.																						
172	172		301									But now, Zack has become a permanent resident of the CPF. Those weird and deformed figures, with the voice of their sacrificed partner, squeezes indescribable screams from their throats and attack them.																						
173	173		301									They don't want Zack's expectations to go to waste.																						
174	174		301									But no matter how hard they try, this is as far as they can make it.																						
175	175		301									"Beardy" looks at Kordes, then takes out their last remaining grenade.

207	207		301									As if sensing the arrival of the uninvited guests, the giant trees behind them unleash a strange roar. The rustling and cries of the Hetero-Creatures can be heard all throughout the forest, just like a warning given by a giant animal when it exposes its fangs.

224	224		301									The source of the disaster was already gone. Burning trees toppled to the ground, and craters are filled with bubbling red liquid in its wake.
