29	28		301									After what feels like an eternity, Camu finally reaches the top level of the pump room.																						
30	29		301									A "pump room," but the sight Camu sees is decidedly... inhuman in design.																						
31	30		301									Strange growths meld and link with others in incomprehensible ways. Only the squirming red electric currents, faintly visible on the abnormal euclidean dimensions, hint at its history as a pump room.																						
32	31		301									What could the pumps be transporting? The answer might be better left unanswered.																						
33	32		301									Camu knows better than to delve into it. He is merely trying to find a miracle hatch that could lead him to the surface.																						
34	33		201							1	500175	1																						
35	34		301							1	Camu	Oh. There's a hatch...	1																					
36	35		301									In the overhanging structure ahead lies a hatch.																						
37	36		301									With a hatch above ground, a corresponding one below should also exist‚Äîthat must be the logic that the auto-building system operates on.																						
38	37		301									...The only issue, is that the hatch is covered in an excess of ashen lock marks, and even the hinges are infested with strange viral growths.																						
39	38		301								Camu	...	1

44	45		301							1		...The hatch remains shut.																						
45	46		301									Camu slams his greatsword in a fury, attempting to destroy the hatch, but it budges not even a little‚Äîevidently not something easily broken at his normal output.																						
46	47		301									But if Camu tries to increase his power output... His lack of a mind link with a commandant will likely...																						
47	48		301									But... the surface is close. Perhaps...?
