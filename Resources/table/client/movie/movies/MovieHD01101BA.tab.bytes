4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Chrome	...Right, that's everything summarized. We've gone through all of the key points regarding the squad-based fire and movement tactic. Anything you want to add, Commandant?	1																					
5	5		302								Nothing. It was a perfect summary.	6	The only problem is there is none.	7																				
6	6	9	301								Chrome	I'm flattered. It really was the clarity of your thought process that made it easy.	1																					
7	7		204							1	1																							
8	8	10	301								Chrome	Is that so? You're quite wisecracking sometimes, Commandant.	1																					
9	9		204							1	1																							
10	10		301									Chrome takes a look at the time on the terminal and smiles, packing up the files used during the discussion.																						
11	11		301								Chrome	It's been nearly an hour... My mission here is also almost done.	1																					
12	12		301								Chrome	In that case, the discussion on the tactics used during our last battle is concluded... Sorry to take up so much of your time today of all days.	1																					
13	13		302								Today of all days...?	14																						
14	14		301									Chrome shakes his head, chuckling. He swipes on the holo-screen, and the battle records show a picture of you fighting with Strike Hawk‚Äîa memory that you cherish.																						
15	15		301								Chrome	I didn't realize it, but you have gone through a lot with us as a commandant... So much so that we can laugh about them now.	1																					
16	16		302								It's been a lot indeed.	17	Too many to count.	17																				
17	17		301									Crossing your arms, you look at the images and descriptions that compose the thrilling past you share, and you feel like being with an old friend‚Äîflipping through photo albums and talking about old days, not noticing the time.																						
18	18		302								The past isn't the only thing we share. The future too.																							
19	19		301								Chrome	Right... we should set our sights on tomrrow. Strike Hawk must grow and perform even better than before... until we're our best selves.	1																					
20	20		301									Chrome reveals a subtle smile as he looks at the members of Strike Hawk in the photo.																						
21	21		301								Chrome	Strike Hawk has been improving because of you. Whether it is Kamui, Wanshi, Camu, or me... you have lifted each one of us up. So, on behalf of Strike Hawk, I'd like to give you this small gift. I hope you'll take it.	1																					
22	22		202							1					1																			
23	23		301									You take the beautifully wrapped gift from Chrome, confused by the sudden gesture.

25	25		202							1					1																			
26	26		301									Right as you are about to ask about the gift, the door to the Strike Hawk lounge opens, and a thick-haired head pokes in.

31	31		302								Is something wrong, Kamui?	32																						
32	32		201							1	1081001																							
33	33		301							1	Kamui	Something is wrong! Very wrong! I saw Celica carrying a stacked folder asking for you on my way back, and she's almost here! Run, Commandant, RUN!	1																					
34	34		301									Extra work is bad, but you reckon it is not bad enough to run away...																						
35	35		302								Perhaps Celica has something important for me?	36																						
36	36		204							1	1																							
37	37		301								Kamui	She would have called you if there was something urgent... not to mention that her folder is filled to the brim! It must all be annoying documents like trivial reports and paperwork inside!	1																					
38	38		302								Why are you so familiar with it?!	39	What a detailed analysis...	39																				
39	39		204							1	2																							
40	40		301								Kamui	Hmph. Wanshi taught me the tricks to handle Celica.	1																					
41	41		201							1	500309																							
42	42		301							1	Chrome	If only your training reports were also as thoroughly analyzed...	1

48	48		301								Chrome	We'll hold Celica off. Commandant, go ahead and return to the Gray Raven lounge...	2																					
49	49		301								Kamui	Go! Lucia and the others are waiting for you!	1																					
50	50		302								Thanks, guys... but...	51																						
51	51		301									Seeing how serious the two of them look, you reckon now is not the time to ask them what is wrong with everyone today...																						
52	52		204							1	1																							
53	53		301								Chrome	One last thing‚Äîplease apologize to Lucia for us. Kamui and I will probably be late...	2																					
54	54		302				AniZhuanchangBegin				Uh... Okay!	55

56	56		301			AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin					You have not found the chance to ask them why, but Lucia and the rest must know something, so your best move is to head back to the Gray Raven lounge. As for Celica... you will have to apologize to her later.

60	60		301			DialogEnable						Having left Strike Hawk, you are still confused about the gift in your hands. And leaving them does not feel like the most considerate thing to do‚Äîyou would feel terrible if they got reprimanded because of you.																						
61	61		302								Maybe I should go back?	62																						
62	62		301									Except that Chrome and Kamui were very insistent on you returning to the lounge as soon as possible. Their urgency slightly worries you, and you cannot make up your mind.																						
63	63		301			RImgBg1Shake						It really is not the best idea to be distracted when walking past a corner. Abstracted, you bump into someone who appears at the corner at the same time.

68	68		301							1	Bianca	Karen, what's wrong... Commandant?!	1																					
69	69		202							1					1																			
70	70		301									Only now do you realize that the person you have run into is none other than Karenina. She is also holding a beautifully decorated box, but right as your gaze lands on it, she immediately hides it behind her back.																						
71	71		201							1	500196																							
72	72		301							1	Karenina	What are you looking at...?!	1																					
73	73		301									You are not sure why Karenina seems to be in such a foul mood today as she mumbles quietly.																						
74	74		301								Karenina	Tch... Dammit, why did we run into each other here... There goes the surprise...	1

76	76		201							2	500128	1	450

79	79		204							1																								
80	80		301								Bianca	The efforts you spent to pick the present will be in vain if you don't give it today...	2																					
81	81		301								Karenina	It wasn't me! You were the one who chose it. I just helped a little...	1																					
82	82		301									Karenina sighs before taking out the decorated box from behind and handing it to you.																						
83	83		301								Karenina	This is for you... Consider it a gift! With Bianca and my tastes combined, this present must be better than the one Gray Raven... Lucia picked!	1																					
84	84		202							1	2				1																			
85	85		301									Taking the gift from Karenina, you find her finally smiling candidly.

88	88		201							2	500128	1	450																					
89	89		301							1	Bianca	It's hard to compare gifts when they all represent their sender's love...	2																					
90	90		301								Karenina	Well, at least we're the first one to deliver ours! I'll count that as a win!	1																					
91	91		202							1	2				1																			
92	92		301									Smiling, Bianca pats Karenina on her head when she discovers the gift from Strike Hawk.																						
93	93		201							2	500128	1																						
94	94		301							1	Bianca	That's... Have you already received a gift from someone else, Commandant?	2																					
95	95		302								This is from Strike Hawk...	96																						
96	96		301								Bianca	Strike Hawk... That's the scout team Kamui belongs to, isn't it?	2																					
97	97		302								Yeah... He's pretty lively right now.	98																						
98	98		301								Bianca	Hmm, that's good... I haven't really seen him since last time, but I suppose no one wants to see the Purifying Force a second time.	2																					
99	99		301								Bianca	If it weren't for you, I would have taken him down as another soldier infected by the Punishing Virus.	2																					
100	100		301								Bianca	That decision might seem obvious to you, but it wasn't for someone who has always been in the Purifying Force like me... Please accept my utmost gratitude.	2																					
101	101		301								Bianca	It wasn't just that. I've been following what you've done, Commandant. Your conviction always seems to create impossible miracles when there is none.	2																					
102	102		302								I'm not as remarkable as you make me out to be...	103	I was lucky.	103																				
103	103		202							2					1

105	105		201							2	500128	1	450																					
106	106		301							1	Bianca	The work you've done has given so many of us hope. The gifts you're receiving are the best proof.	2																					
107	107		301								Karenina	For crying out loud, enough with your courtesy. Just accept the gift and people's gratitude, especially today, alright?	1																					
108	108		302								Right... Understood. Thank you.	109	I'll keep working hard as a commandant.	109																				
109	109		301								Karenina	Yeah, yeah. Lucia... the Gray Ravens are still waiting for you. We might as well head there together.	1																					
110	110		301								Bianca	That's right. Although it's common for the protagonist to show up last, you shouldn't make the others wait too long.	2																					
111	111		302								The protagonist? Is that me...?	112																						
112	112		202							1	2																							
113	113		301									As the impatient Karenina pushes you forward, you hear the piercing screeching sound of tires skidding across the floor.																						
114	114		302								Who is driving on Babylonia...?	115																						
115	115		401							1	205																							
116	116		301			RImgBg1Shake					???	Gray Raven Commandant! I've finally found you!																						
117	117		301									With her powerful shout, Celica appears at the end of the corridor‚Äîalong with someone else...																						
118	118		201							1	500091	1																						
119	119		301							1	Nanami	Ta-da! Nanami is also here!	1																					
120	120		301									Nanami is carrying Celica on the back of her Pulse frame, the wheel on her feet spinning at incredible speed. The sight reminds you of medieval knights charging on horseback.																						
121	121		301								Nanami	Stories dictate an antagonist for maximum drama! Nanami is now the villain's goon!	1																					
122	122		201							1	500001	4																						
123	123		301							1	Celica	Who are you saying is a villain...?	1																					
124	124		201							1	500128																							
125	125		301							1	Bianca	We can't let Celica catch the commandant today... We're counting on you, Rosetta!	1																					
126	126		202							1					1																			
127	127		301									With that, the flame of a propeller approaches from a distance, stopping beside you.																						
128	128		302								Rosetta? Where did you come from?	129																						
129	129		201							1	500214																							
130	130		301							1	Rosetta	Don't mind that for now... Commandant, hold on to me... We have to go!	1

132	132		204							1	6																							
133	133	137	301								Rosetta	Commandant... y-you can put some muscle behind it. This frame is sturdy enough to withstand it.	1																					
134	134		204							1	6																							
135	135		301								Rosetta	Oh...?! Sorry, Commandant, that was a bit too tight. I'm worried that the stiff exterior of my frame will hurt you.	1																					
136	136		202							1					1																			
137	137		301									You look back, your arms around Rosetta's slim waist, and you find Nanami and Celica fast approaching.																						
138	138		302								Nanami is coming!																							
139	139		201							1	500091	1																						
140	140		301							1	Nanami	That's right, Nanami is coming! Full steam ahead!	1

149	149		301									Before you are ready, the landscape before you turns into a speeding blur as the wind and the loud rumblings of the propellers are funneled into your head...																						
150	150		301									Your mind almost melts from the high velocity. You are only staying awake because of one simple fact‚Äîyou cannot let go. If you do...

156	156		301									It has only been a few minutes, but you feel like you have returned to the high-g training chamber at F.O.S. for half a day.																						
157	157		201							1	500214																							
158	158		301							1	Rosetta	It seems like it'll take them a while to catch up... Are you alright, Commandant?	1																					
159	159		202							1					1																			
160	160		301									Rosseta breathes a sigh of relief, her feet firmly planted on the ground. Meanwhile, you are barely standing straight, only staying up with her support.																						
161	161		302								Yeah. I'm fine.	162																						
162	162		301									Your vision is still hazy, but your surroundings are familiar. You know them even with your eyes closed.																						
163	163		201							1	500214	1																						
164	164		301							1	Rosetta	Alright, it is the Gray Raven lounge right ahead. Everyone should be waiting for you inside. It's still not too late if you go now.	1																					
165	165		202							1					1																			
166	166		301									Rosetta hesitates for a second before letting you go, extending the propellers on her shoulders and hovering before you.																						
167	167		302								What about you, Rosetta?	168																						
168	168		201							1	500214	4																						
169	169		301							1	Rosetta	I'll... help draw Celica away. I hope I can buy you some time.	1																					
170	170		301									You do not know what they are planning in the lounge, but it seems like everyone is coming over‚Äîyet, Rosetta has excluded herself from "everyone," intentionally or not.																						
171	171		204							1	14																							
172	172		301									Rosetta smiles, wrily, looking at the door to the lounge.																						
173	173		301								Rosetta	I'm still under Babylonia's monitor. If I appear with all of you, people may make a thing out of it‚ÄîI do not wish you anything but joy and peace of mind today.	1																					
174	174		302								You don't have to worry about those people.	175	Rosetta, you are one of us.	175																				
175	175		202							1					1																			
176	176		301									Looking a little surprised, she gives you a gentle smile. She takes out a colorful, intricate box from her pocket.																						
177	177		302								Is that... for me?	178																						
178	178		201							1	500214	1																						
179	179		301							1	Rosetta	I've been hesitant to give you this present as a token of my gratitude. After all, it is nothing compared to the things you have done for me... for the Forest Guard.	1																					
180	180		204							1	8																							
181	181		301									Rosetta closes her eyes, touching your forehead with hers‚Äîyou have heard that this is the way Forest Guard expresses their thanks.																						
182	182		301								Rosetta	But perhaps we don't have to weigh appreciation aginst the value of a gift.	1																					
183	183		301								Rosetta	Once again, thank you, Commandant...	1																					
184	184		204							1	1																							
185	185		301									She opens her eyes again, lifting her head with confidence, her prism-colored wings extending with strength.

196	196		301									You walk inside to find the automatic lights not turning on as usual. Realizing something is out of the ordinary, you put down the gifts you have received, your hand going for the pistol by your arms.

230	230		202							1	2				1																			
231	231		301									Lee was the one who decorated the room... You certainly did not expect that.																						
232	232		302								Speaking of which, where is Lee?	233																						
233	233		301								???	That's why you should hang the ribbons at different heights to look make them more natural and artistic!																						
234	234		301								???	What even is "artistic"...

239	239		301								Lee	I don't know much about decorating a birthday party, but if you want my help, you have to be specific about what you want instead of asking me to wriggle these ribbons around...	2

247	247		204							2																								
248	248		301								Lee	The others wanted to throw you a birthday party, but they weren't sure what to do, so we asked Ayla to be the organizer...	2																					
249	249		301								Ayla	Ahem, it's "Chief Designer", actually. Of course I have to make sure everything is perfect!	1																					
250	250		302								You really don't have to go overboard for me...	251																						
251	251		301								Ayla	Everyone's birthday is special and worth commemorating‚Äîit was like that during the Golden Age, and it should be so now... during a time of uncertainty.	1																					
252	252		301									Perhaps Ayla is right. When you cannot easily predict what tomorrow brings, you should cherish today.																						
253	253		301								Ayla	According to WGAA's records, people used to host parties this way in the past, celebrating their birthdays with their families.	1

255	255		201							1	500021																							
256	256		301							1	Liv	Right... Birthdays used to be my favorite day of the year when I was younger.	1																					
257	257		301									The past seems to flash through Liv's mind, her smile filled with nostalgia and a hint of sorrow.																						
258	258		301								Liv	I would be with my family. The night was warm and dusky, and the pie my mom prepared was fragrant and sweet‚ÄîI still remember how it tasted, even after I became a Construct.	1																					
259	259		301								Liv	Perhaps because my sense of taste has been modified, I can never make a pie that tastes like hers, no matter what... Otherwise, I can make one for you, Commandant.	1																					
260	260		301								Liv	Still, I have prepared a cake for you and everyone, Commandant. I hope you will like it.	1																					
261	261		302								I look forward to it.	262																						
262	262		201							1	500026

266	266		201							1	500026																							
267	267		301							1	Lee	A birthday-cake-tooth, technically. He's curious about them.	1																					
268	268		301								Lee	Our family wasn't exactly rich, but we still kept each other's birthdays in our mind. We would always try to prepare small gifts on those days.	1																					
269	269		202							1					1																			
270	270		301									Lee talks about his past as he adheres the ribbons to the wall with great focus, making sure they are straight as an arrow.

272	272		301							1	Liv	I feel like we never hear much about your past, Lee...	1																					
273	273		302								That's true. I'm your commandant, but I've never really asked you about it.	274																						
274	274		201							1	500026	10																						
275	275		301							1	Lee	...That's alright. We don't have to bore you with the details. After all, you're the star today, Commandant...	1

277	277		301							1	Lucia	I still remember my parents would always throw exciting parties on my birthdays, no matter what...	1																					
278	278		301								Lucia	Just like today, friends and family would gather, and I'd receive a lot of gifts like you do, Commandant.	1																					
279	279		204							1	2																							
280	280		301									Lucia smiles and nods, looking at the pile of gifts to the side. Those are the gifts you have received on your way back.																						
281	281		301								Lucia	Every time I saw those gifts, I felt lucky to be born into such a large family, and I came into this world with all of their blessings...	1																					
282	282		204							1	5																							
283	283		301								Lucia	So no matter how difficult things were, I decided that I couldn't give up that easily‚Äînot when I had their support.	1																					
284	284		301									Lucia's fists slowly tighten as she nods.																						
285	285		301								Lucia	And now, it isn't just the memories of the past supporting me. Commandant... and everyone... you're all part of my family now.	1																					
286	286		302								I also think of all of you as family.	287																						
287	287		301									As Lucia said‚Äîdespite the hardships you have been through, you have not regretted becoming a commandant of Babylonia and Gray Raven. Becoming a part of a family.																						
288	288		202							1					1																			
289	289		301									As Lucia said‚Äîdespite the many regrets you have had, you have not regretted becoming a commandant of Babylonia and Gray Raven. Becoming a part of a family.																						
290	290		301									Still, one thing continues to bother you...																						
291	291		302								How do you know it's my birthday today?	292																						
292	292		301									As you recall, you have never told anyone when your birthday is, and you have never been asked to put down that information. Even you have almost forgotten about this date.																						
293	293		301									Lucia and Liv hesitate, seemingly unsure whether to tell you the truth. In the end, Lee reveals the truth.																						
294	294		201							1	500026	10																						
295	295		301							1	Lee	Well, we have Vera to thank...	1

304	304		202							1					1																			
305	305		301									The three Gray Ravens have finally caught up to Vera, only to find her accompanied by the other two Cerberus members as she mockingly laughs at Lucia's request.																						
306	306		201							1	500168	1																						
307	307		301							1	Vera	That's funny. I personally don't have any classified info of your commandant on me. Does either of you?	1

369	369		301							1	Vera	Yeah. What were you expecting...? Did you think I'd send you to assassinate someone? Relax, I can do those jobs myself.	1

459	459		301									Celica grabs a card from the pile with a cute drawing on it and hands it to you. It is clearly signed with her name.

461	461		301								Celica	Happy birthday, Gray Raven Commandant! This is my gift for you.	1																					
462	462		302								Thank you, Celica.	463																						
463	463		301									You nod and take the card. It appears that work is going to be busy tomorrow.

468	468		301							1	Lee	The cards from Celica reminded me that we received messages from Forsaken and Akdilek earlier today as well.	1																					
469	469		301								Lee	Who knows, maybe they're also wishing you a happy birthday...	1

476	476		301								Zong	Sure thing! When have I ever screwed up?																						
477	477		301								Watanabe	Then perhaps you're losing your mind‚Äîhonestly, is it necessary for us to send that commandant a birthday message?	1																					
478	478		301								Zong	Eh?! Boss, you're the one who always says Forsaken doesn't forget our friends. If it's a friend's birthday, it's only right for us to send our blessings even when we can't physically be there.																						
479	479		301									Watanabe does not seem to be able to refute Zong. He tries to say something, only to hold his words back, turning to the camera instead.																						
480	480		204							1	1																							
481	481		301								Watanabe	Alright... Ahem. First of all, I'd like to say "thanks" on behalf of the Forsaken. You've come to our aid multiple times last year, and your efforts have earned our respect.	1																					
482	482		301								Watanabe	If this message is delivered to Babylonia on time, then it's still your birthday today...	1																					
483	483		301								Watanabe	Birthdays... are crucial to us Forsakens. It's likely that we will die on this land, alone and unknown. So we mourn the dead, and we celebrate the living.	1																					
484	484		301								Watanabe	So, allow me to say this on behalf of all of us. Happy birthday.	1																					
485	485		301								Zong	Okay, perfect! What a wonderful speech, boss. It felt like you were speaking from your heart instead of the prompter.																						
486	486		204							1																								
487	487		301								Watanabe	Enough with that crap. Is the recording done?	1																					
488	488		301								Zong	Relax. The recording will be automatically encrypted and sent to Gray Raven through a secured channel in just a second.																						
489	489		301								Zong	Oh, wait. I just discovered a problem...																						
490	490		301								Watanabe	What is it?	1																					
491	491		202							1																								
492	492		301								Zong	It seems to have recorded our conversation before and after the message as well... Hey, boss, chill! Put down your dagger first!

577	577		301									It is different from your usual recording device. This is an old camera from the golden age. The records you read call it an "instant camera."																						
578	578		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Ayla	Compared to digital data, a camera like this can turn memories into a photo that you can physically hold. I think it's beautiful that way.	1
