9	9		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The blood drops and soaks the girl's skirt.																						
10	10		301									The evil dragon hangs down its giant head, its chest pounding and its claws grasping feebly at the air.																						
11	11		301									The girl's lips are trembling. It is as if she has mustered her last bit of strength. The sound of her pipe is weak and fading, but she is not giving up.																						
12	12		301									There is no resentment or hatred in her iris-colored eyes. They are as clear as the lake water in autumn, yet they express so many indescribable feelings.																						
13	13		301									The dragon and the girl share the same life.																						
14	14		301									The evil dragon must be slain.																						
15	16		301									The girl knows that more than anyone else.																						
16	17		301									Every second she hesitates, more people will die.																						
17	18		301									When your eyes meet, you both understand what has to be done.																						
18	19		301									The pointy end of that pipe is thrust deeply into the flesh.																						
19	20		301									The pain suffocates her. The sorrowful sound of pipe clearly shows how she is having trouble breathing.																						
20	21		301									The champion must fulfill the destiny.																						
21	22		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The girl looks up slightly as she bathes in the sunlight. Her sight penetrates the cold stone walls and the ravaged wastelands to a beautiful place.																						
22	23		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cg2401_8.jpg																								
23	24		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						It is as if she has forgotten all her suffering. There is a faint smile on her face.																						
24	25		301									The music is coming to an end as the girl puts the pipe against her chest and closes her eyes peacefully.																						
25	26		301									The crimson eyes of that evil dragon dull as it lies flat on the floor and stops breathing.																						
26	27		301									You are overwhelmed by a sense of despair and depression.																						
27	28		301									The world quickly rewinds as you regain all your senses in the real world. Countless memories fill your mind.																						
28	29		301									It feels like a late prophecy. Like the judgment of a prophet.																						
29	30		301									The girl writes a story to seal her own fate. What a dramatic coincidence.																						
30	31		301									She has written down every torment she can possibly imagine in such detail. All the sorrowful feelings are hidden in the chest, waiting for the cruel reality to reveal them one by one.																						
31	32		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					What a tragic yet somewhat comedic story this is.

62	64		301									How will she answer these questions?																						
63	65		301									The blinding light shines as the camera catches every subtle movement in milliseconds. Nothing escapes its iris, whether it's the fingers, the lips, or any other part of the body.																						
64	66		301									She thought there would be nothing she could have hidden.																						
65	67		301									Selena opens her mouth but utters no sound. Heavily breathing, she puts both of her hands on her restless, racing heart.

70	72		301									Ink soaks the paper wet. The pen drops to the floor.																						
71	73		301									The holographic screen is on. Some words are typed and then removed.																						
72	74		301									Countless fantasies echo in her mind as if ghosts from the past have come back to haunt her, screaming they want to be made real.																						
73	75		301									Her fingertips are burning. The words she was once proud of are now a mess. The elegance in her sentences is gone. She cannot piece together any meaningful phrases.																						
74	76		301									This has never been easy. And she can never stop writing. The ending of a show isn't really an end. She has to keep on writing, restless and scared.																						
75	77		301									Even if she thinks she is out of ideas and even if she is actually out of ideas, she has to press on.																						
76	78		301									Her pen describes arrogance, childishness, innocence, lies, and baseless speculations. Her work is hollow and empty.																						
77	79		301									She has nothing to defend herself with.																						
78	80		301									The flowers in a greenhouse have never faced a real storm. She was born in the safe cradle of an ark in a post-apocalyptic world.																						
79	81		301									Thinking back on her life, she feels everything has been baseless and powerless without actual meaning.																						
80	82		301									She is a mess, but the moment harsh critiques force her to speculate the true anguish, the guilt that has been haunting her becomes more intense than ever.																						
81	83		301									Even so, she still holds onto that last bit of hope and prays she can get some ideas and inspiration from the pain and sorrow of her guilt.																						
82	84		301									Now her charms are all o'erthrown.																						
83	85		301									Is it always this hard to figure out how to create something new?																						
84	86		301									Is it always this painful to create something new?																						
85	87		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					What is it that she insists on? What drove her to choose this path?

89	91		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						She found her first work.																						
90	92		301									It is a very simple, even childish, fantasy story.																						
91	93		301									She created a world, though the storytelling was awkward.																						
92	94		301									She shared the world with her friends using words.																						
93	95		301									The world filled her small book and overflew.																						
94	96		301									There was a righteous champion, a mysterious piper, a magical witch, an evil dragon, and countless people trapped in a desperate situation yet not giving up on hope.																						
95	97		301									And there was herself, young, innocent, and naive.																						
96	98		301									Yes. She didn't have any ambition at the beginning.																						
97	99		301									She just wanted to tell a story.																						
98	100		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					So, she picks up a pen.																						
99	101		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory0.png																								
100	102		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						She shatters herself.																						
101	103		301									She puts herself—now arrogant, miserable, and guilty—in this story.																						
102	104		301									Perhaps this messy, childish story will develop numerous endings.																						
103	105		301									Perhaps she will have numerous clones.																						
104	106		301									Clones that live in the real world and the fantasy world.																						
105	107		301									Clones that keep growing.																						
106	108		301									But those clones are herself.																						
107	109		301									In the world they created together, Selena will have her own ending and destiny. She will talk to herself.																						
108	110		301									She will tell herself everything about the views she has seen and the places she has been.																						
109	111		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Her story will forever be left on a to-be-continue.

112	114		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						On the day of Operation Red Tide. In the Technology Department of  the Control Court, Babylonia.																						
113	115		301									The holographic screen flashes and blinks every millisecond as people operate several terminals, focusing on their tasks at hand. Sometimes, these people will gather around and have a brief talk before they go back to their own businesses. Then, with a beep, the door of this room opens.																						
114	116		301									The human in a uniform stands up to greet the visitors and operate their terminals to check the lists.																						
115	117		301									When she sees the item being transported this time, she can't help but take a step back.																						
116	118		301									She can make out what seems to be a humanoid statue hidden beneath the large canvas. It is so huge that it almost blocks the hallway.																						
117	119		301								Sullie	What is this? Why do we have to inspect and check the entity technologies of a WGAA device?																						
118	120		301									This isn't really a question as the speaker isn't expecting an answer but just complaining. Every item from the Babylonia administrative department is approved and uploaded to the associated terminal with documents.																						
119	121		301									Sullie enters a command into the system but realizes the document doesn't allow her access to read it.																						
120	122		301									With her eyebrows furrowed, she looks up and is surprised to see a hand placed on the canvas.																						
121	123		301									Another pink-haired female Construct dressed in the same uniform turns and nods at her colleague.																						
122	124		301								Sullie	Ishmael, you scared me.																						
123	125		201							1	500380																							
124	126		301							1	Ishmael	Sorry. I didn't see you.	1																					
125	127		202							1					1																			
126	128		301									When there is something this big blocking the hallway, there is no way you can miss it.																						
127	129		301									Sullie doesn't want to talk about this any further, so she just waves her hand, telling the other girl to drop this subject.																						
128	130		301								Sullie	So, you are back from the surface, huh? Did you find anything?																						
129	131		301								Sullie	I heard this is an emergency. What's the situation? All the missions are highly classified. I haven't heard any news.																						
130	132		301								??	Everything involving the Task Force is an emergency.																						
131	133		301									The voice of a woman comes from the room.																						
132	134		301									Ishmael's arrival livens up the air in this room.																						
133	135		201							1	500380																							
134	136		301							1	Ishmael	Things are different this time.	1																					
135	137		301									Ishmael's tone is monotonous. It seems she doesn't want to share anything more about this mission, so she quickly changes to another subject.																						
136	138		301									She reaches out with one hand and opens it.																						
137	139		301									There is a purple flower in her palm.																						
138	140		301								Ishmael	I found this on the surface this time.	1																					
139	141		301								Ishmael	It is a purple iris.	1																					
140	142		202							1					1																			
141	143		301									The blade-like leaves expand outward as the dreamy, fragile purple petals curl, forming a layered, elegant shape. Its beauty is far beyond that of anything artificial.																						
142	144		301									The flower is almost floating above Ishmael's palm. The shimmering light proves this is not real.																						
143	145		301									This is a flower made of data.																						
144	146		301								Sullie	You seem like you are enjoying yourself.																						
145	147		301									Upon taking a closer look, Sullie realizes this is indeed just an ordinarily beautiful flower made of data. She is not interested anymore.																						
146	148		301									Everyone who comes back from the surface has to go through multiple tedious checking and disinfection processes. The same goes for every object brought back from the surface, even if it's just a flower or a rock.																						
147	149		301									And Ishmael is especially fond of collecting those things.																						
148	150		301									She seems interested in every little thing she finds on the surface.																						
149	151		301									And the restricting rules push Ishmael to start using her power.																						
150	152		301									Ishmael has the ability to rebuild anything in detail using only data. There is no solid evidence, but Sullie is certain Ishmael is one of the best Babylonia Constructs when it comes to calculating.																						
151	153		301									It is almost magic instead of calculation.																						
152	154		301									An item created by Ishmael is actually even more exquisite and "realistic" than the real item.																						
153	155		301									She is almost like Rabbi, the legend of the Golden Age who could infuse souls into clays using sorcery.																						
154	156		301									But unfortunately, she seems to be interested in only strange little things.																						
155	157		301									Take the iris flower this time for example, or the gray marionette she brought back last time...																						
156	158		301									She has a taste for retro stuff.																						
157	159		301									Sullie looks at Ishmael's seat and sees light spots floating above the desk. She gets closer and feels as if she has entered a display case of the Golden Age filled with various strange toys.																						
158	160		301									She focuses back on reality as her mind slowly drifts away and looks at Ishmael, who is talking to the others in the room and slightly turns her head as if she has sensed Sullie's attention.																						
159	161		301									Her white pupils are like a void filled with magic power. She smiles as if she wants to know whether Sullie wants anything.																						
160	162		301								Sullie	Oh, and about that dramatic thing outside... I think it's called Hamlet or something.																						
161	163		301								Sullie	I don't have enough access to browse the documents. Can you take a look for me?																						
162	164		301									Ishmael nods at the other people and starts checking the system. Her attention seems to focus on a single line. After a while, she shuts down the system.																						
163	165		201							1	500380																							
164	166		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Ishmael	Alright. I'll take it over from here.	1
