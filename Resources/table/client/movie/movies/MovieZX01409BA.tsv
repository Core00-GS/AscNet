5	3		301			DialogEnable				1	Atiel	Hey, Simon! By the looks of the stuff here, I think we made it to the database room.	1																					
6	4		301								Simon	Hang on, let me have a look...	2																					
7	5		301								Simon	Hey, Diana. Are you familiar with this system?	2

11	6		301							1	Diana	Only just a thing or two.	3																					
12	7		301								Atiel	I'll give you a hand, too!	1																					
13	8		301									After securing the server room in the research lab, Simon immediately sets about looking for intel on Amberia.

16	9		301							1		Not technologically inclined and unable to help, Rosetta is in the room lost in thought.																						
17	1008		302								What's on your mind?	10	Tired?	11																				
18	10	12	301								Rosetta	I was just thinking about how many Forest Guards were born here.	1																					
19	11	12	301								Rosetta	Maybe...	1																					
20	12		301								Rosetta	I may be labeled a sinner all the same, but I don't carry the same weight as Diana and the others.	1																					
21	13		301								Rosetta	I was modified because of other reasons. After I was reborn, I've been fighting ever since.	1																					
22	14		301								Rosetta	After all this fighting, I may have gotten stronger. But I still can't change my misfortune...	1																					
23	1009		204							1	8																							
24	15		301								Rosetta	And when I met you and Alpha, I really thought that was the end.	1																					
25	16		301								Rosetta	But I survived, and then I had to face Alpha again. Then this time, I thought it would just be a few minor skirmishes...	1																					
26	17		301								Rosetta	Who'd have thought? We're now up against that Amberia in the legends.	1																					
27	1010		302								It's just a coincidence.	18	Looks like we're all unlucky.	18																				
28	18		301								Rosetta	...Of course, I by no means think I'm special. I'm just used to it is all.	1																					
29	19		301								Rosetta	But enough about me... If we can solve this once and for all, then the Forest Guards can finally rest at ease.	1																					
30	1012		302								Why?	20	But we can't tell anyone about Amberia. Can we?	21																				
31	20	500	301								Rosetta	...Bygones can finally be bygones. And we can bring an end to the nightmare known as Amberia.	1																					
32	21	500	301								Rosetta	It doesn't matter. What matters is that we put the past to rest.	1																					
33	500		204							1	4																							
34	22		301								Rosetta	In fact, many people in the ARU think that the "tide" is just a ruse by the Forest Guard to ensure our status.	1																					
35	23		301								Rosetta	They're always afraid that we will become the next Amberia.	1																					
36	24		301								Rosetta	They've always been in fear, in fear that another Amberia will rise in the ARU.	1																					
37	7001		301								Rosetta	Fearing... even with that master code they programmed us with—the code to make us listen to their commands.	1																					
38	25		301								Rosetta	But none of the Forest Guard wishes for revenge... "Amid torrential snow and wind, the Forest Guard's honor stands strong."	1																					
39	26		301								Rosetta	This is an old saying among the Forest Guard... Well, I guess the Forest Guard aren't exactly that old.	1

42	27		301							1	Simon	So... Why did they turn you into Constructs? If they fear the power of humanoid-hybrids, then why would they continue making them?	2																					
43	28		301								Rosetta	There wasn't a choice. The Punishing Virus poses a terrifying threat.	1																					
44	29		301								Rosetta	Corrupted invasions are rare for the ARU, but not nonexistent. We're far from safe...	1

47	1018		201							3	500088	4																						
48	30		301							1	Diana	You could use ordinary machines to deal with the tide. If you can't defeat them, you can always just run. After all, the tide will eventually recede.	3																					
49	31		301								Diana	That, however, is not an option for the Corrupted. So, there's no choice but to use Constructs...	3																					
50	32		301								Simon	You're walking a fine line... Then how do you stop humanoid-hybrid frames from going "berserk?"	2																					
51	33		301								Diana	As long as the frames are made more "human-like," it'll be fine—or so I've heard... But I'm afraid only the higher-ups know the technical details.	3

53	1020		201							1	500214	4																						
54	34		301							1	Rosetta	The Arctic Route Union... has been, and is still trapped in the nightmare known as "Amberia". Everyone has lost hope.	1																					
55	35		301								Rosetta	If we really can get rid of Amberia... The Forest Guards and the ARU as a whole can start looking toward the future.	1																					
56	36		301								Rosetta	Commandant, sorry for asking you this right now—but will you help us bring an end to the nightmare that plagues this land?	1																					
57	1021		302								Of course.	37	That's what I've been doing.	38																				
58	37	1022	301								Rosetta	Thank you.	1																					
59	38	1022	301								Rosetta	Yes, you're right.	1																					
60	1022		201							1	500201																							
61	39		301							1	Simon	Everyone, I found files on Amberia!	1																					
62	40		301									After searching for some time, Simon jumps in and interrupts your conversation. He points to some records on the screen showing Amberia's true form.																						
63	1023		203							1	0.25	400																						
64	1024		201							2	500206	5	-400																					
65	41		301							1	Atiel	Can... can you still call her a humanoid-hybrid?	2																					
66	42		301									Your eyes are immediately taken by a figure with a tar-black mass for a lower body on the screen. Your skin crawls at the sight of her almost insectile hands and deconstructional mechanisms.																						
67	43		301									A giant woman is connected to the front of the black lower body. You roughly make out that this is a humanoid structure left to synchronize the M.I.N.D.																						
68	44		301									Yet, even this humanoid figure does not invoke relief. The bundles of installments and devices jutting out of her only serve to enhance its uncanniness.																						
69	45		301								Atiel	This is too much... Even if she never went berserk because of some bug... to see herself become such a monstrosity...	2																					
70	46		301									——You would definitely go mad.																						
71	47		301									The chamber remains silent, but the same thought lingers in everyone's mind.																						
72	48		301								Simon	As long as the frames are made more "human-like," huh... But they... they've turned Amberia into a monster.	1																					
73	49		301									Reading through the data, you learn that the Forest Guard's Construct framework is a subsidiary form of the technology used to create Amberia.																						
74	50		301									Only intentionally downgraded.																						
75	51		301								Simon	...Anyway, the most important information is on the next page.	1																					
76	52		301									Simon could barely maintain composure at the grotesque figure on the screen. With an already pale face, he stifles his urge to vomit and scrolls to the next entry.																						
77	53		301								System	Secret Entry 618—Code.																						
78	54		301									Here is a detailed account of Amberia's control system configuration. The final entry outlined the specifics on what exactly her code entailed.																						
79	55		301								Atiel	The obsolete bionic series—Derek. It's voice is the code...	2																					
80	1025		201							1	500088	4	400																					
81	1026		201							2	500214	4	-400																					
82	56		301							1	Diana	Ah...	1																					
83	57		301								Rosetta	The code is... Derek's voice?	2																					
84	58		301									Everyone finds their mouth agape. Except Simon, who, without a single clue, is waiting for someone's explanation.																						
85	59		301			RImgBg1Shake					Bionic Machine	ROAR!!!																						
86	60		301									A sudden roar of the bionics removes the room out of its reverie. Immediately following the roar, tremors from fracturing glaciers cause the room to tremble.																						
87	1027		302								What's going on outside?	61	Return to the base—NOW!	3000																				
88	61	62	301								Diana	A horde of bionics are rushing ashore... Based on their direction, they seem to be targeting the residential regions!	1																					
89	62		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Rosetta	They're targeting the residential regions this time... Commandant, we need to hurry back!	2

91	3001	63	201							1	500201																							
92	63		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Simon	Yeah. Let's rush back and protect the others!	1
