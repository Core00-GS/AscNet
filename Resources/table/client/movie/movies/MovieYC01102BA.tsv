8	6		301							1	Chrome	We'll look suspicious if we're spotted hanging out with the Kowloong Crew. Besides, we already got what we wanted from him.	2																					
9	7		301								Chrome	I'm not sure what sort of helpers he got, so we'd better count on ourselves still. Just the two of us. Got it, Kamui?	2

15	11		301							1	Murray	The system is called Huaxu, right? I looked it up in Babylonia's database, and it does share a similar design architecture to Gestalt.	1																					
16	12		301								Murray	There are a lot of blanks though. I must apply for higher access from my superiors.	1																					
17	13		202								Murray	...So are you two going to attend the trade event later?	1

19	14		201							1	500155																							
20	15		301							1	Chrome	...Yeah. According to what Chaofeng said, Qu will only appear at the trade event.	1

22	17		201							2	1081001	1	400																					
23	18		301							2	Kamui	But the trade event should be held at that really open place we just passed by, right? Won't we be spotted instantly if we participate?	2																					
24	19		301								Chrome	We can probably hide ourselves in the buildings, but if we want to approach Qu as soon as we can, we have to be close to the central stage.	1

35	28		301							1	Murray	What if we use the merchandise inside the shipping crates, then? While tracking Chaofeng through your visuals, I found some compartments holding a lot of clothes.	1

39	31		301							1	Chrome	That might work. If we dress up as a guest or a Construct on display, we could blend in quite easily.	1

41	33		201							1	500146	1																						
42	34		301							1	Murray	Dressing up as merchandise on display should be your best choice. That way you'd be able to move around freely on the stage. Unfortunately the system only takes female Constructs...	1																					
43	35		301									Murray falls into deep thought for a bit. He studies the two Strike Hawk members carefully in turn, then, dawning on a solution, finally claps his hands.																						
44	36		301							1	Murray	Chrome, can you dress up as a femaleâ€”	1

52	42		301							1	Chrome	Sure.	2																					
53	43		301									The two answer at almost the same time. Kamui, Chrome, and Murray end up staring at each other in a sudden awkward silence.																						
54	44		301								Chrome	Kamui might be too tall and broad to find clothes that fit him. Compared to him, I should be the better choice.	2

58	47		301							1	Murray	A very logical conclusion... As expected from the leader of the vanguard force...	1																					
59	48		301								Murray	Why did you offer up yourself, Kamui?	1

61	50		201							2	1081001	2	400

63	995		204							1	4																							
64	52		301							1	Murray	...Just that?	1																					
65	53		301								Kamui	Hmm.	2																					
66	54		301								Kamui	Male or female doesn't matter! I'm still me, and the leader is still the leader. It's all the same inside.	2

70	58		301							1	Murray	The Strike Hawk Squad sure is... quite enlightened...	1																					
71	59		301								Murray	Well, if one of you dress up as merchandise there has to be a seller, which might require talking...	1																					
72	60		301								Murray	So Kamui, looks like you get to be pretty.	1

81	66		301							1	Murray	No need to worry about that. As long as we've got an outfit, I can direct the makeup process.	1																					
82	67		301								Murray	I guess I'll need your help for that, Chrome. More reason for Kamui to dress up.	1																					
83	68		301								Murray	I have some dabbled a little in this... or I wouldn't have made the suggestion in the first place. You guys should try to acquire some clothes first.	1																					
84	69		301								Murray	Meanwhile, I'll go brush up on how to do this with someone else... We can get in touch in 20 minutes, yeah?	1
