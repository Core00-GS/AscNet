6	6		301								Changyu	What's going on?	2																					
7	7		301									One of the containers on your truck is open, and there's clearly something missing.																						
8	8		301								Changyu	What is this? Damage like this wasn't caused by collision.	2																					
9	9		302								Corrupted	10	It's the attack from earlier	11																				
10	10	12	301								Changyu	The Corrupted... why are they doing this?	2																					
11	11		301								Changyu	The Corrupted attacked us for our food? That's weird!	2																					
12	12		301								Watanabe	Doesn't matter why. What matters is the cargo is lost.	1																					
13	13		302								What did we lose?	14																						
14	14		301									Changyu checks the damaged container thoroughly.																						
15	15		301								Changyu	Oh no, the lotus leaves are all gone...	2

17	17		201							1	500166	6																						
18	18		301							1	Lucia	Lotus leaves? What is that?	1																					
19	19		201							1	500026																							
20	20		301							1	Lee	To my knowledge, it is the external wrapping for a Zong. The leaves are inedible. If the aim is to open consume the Zong, then the leaves are of no consequence.	1																					
21	21		201							1	1101001	5																						
22	22		301							1	Watanabe	Hmph, what is a Zong without its lotus leaf wrapping?	1																					
23	23		201							1	500124																							
24	24		301							1	Changyu	Right! Then it'll just be steamed rice!	1																					
25	25		201							1	500026																							
26	26		301							1	Lee	We Constructs have no need for food, and have no way of obtaining energy necessary to us from food. Must we insist on this item?	1																					
27	27		201							1	1101001																							
28	28		301							1	Watanabe	It is because of this, that the act of eating is most vital.	1																					
29	100		201							1	1031001	7																						
30	101		301							1	Liv	It is true that Constructs do not need to eat, so much so that even our sense of taste is extrapolated through data simulation. But that doesn't mean that we can forget what food tastes like!	1																					
31	102		201							1	500124	1																						
32	103		301							1	Changyu	We can't forget what it was like to taste food... when we were human...	1																					
33	29		201							1	1031001	6																						
34	125		301							1	Liv	It also aids in stabilizing the M.I.N.D.!	1																					
35	199		204							1	14																							
36	30		301								Liv	But I calculate that it will take a whole day, maybe more, for you to retrace your steps and attempt to recover the missing cargo...	1																					
37	31		201							1	1101001																							
38	32		301							1	Watanabe	We'll just have to replace it with other leaves.	1																					
39	33		201							1	500124																							
40	34		301							1	Changyu	Would that even work?	1																					
41	35		201							1	1101001																							
42	36		301							1	Watanabe	There was never a rule about what leaves we had to use for Zongs. I recall that a suitable plant grows not far from hereâ€”though the Corrupted congregate there.	1																					
43	37		201							1	1031001	1																						
44	38		301							1	Liv	Let us help, Watanabe-San!	1																					
45	39		201							1	1101001																							
46	40		301							1	Watanabe	No, this concerns the Forsaken alone. We don't need Babylonia's interference.	1																					
47	41		201							1	500124																							
48	42		301							1	Changyu	No, this is bigger than the Forsaken... I must assist in recovering the cargo, to restore the ACA's reputation.	1																					
49	43		301								Changyu	And I wish to enlist the members of Gray Raven to assist me.	1																					
50	44		201							1	500026																							
51	45		301							1	Lee	Gray Raven cannot be engaged in any capacity by civilian or individual elements...	1																					
52	46		201							1	1031001	1																						
53	47		301							1	Liv	But helping people against the Corrupted is our duty. Let's lend a hand, Commandant!	1																					
54	48		302								(Agree to assist)	49	(Inquire Lee and Lucia)	53																				
55	49		201							1	500026																							
56	50		301							1	Lee	Though if it is Commandant's decision, we will render assistance.	1																					
57	51		201							1	500166	1																						
58	52	57	301							1	Lucia	Yes, Commandant, please let us help them.	1																					
59	53		201							1	500166	1																						
60	54		301							1	Lucia	I agree with Liv... I think... that this act... is meaningful.	1																					
61	55		201							1	500026																							
62	56		301							1	Lee	You will take on this illegal contract whether I agree or not, so I have no choice but to follow along.	1																					
63	57		201							1	1101001																							
64	58		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Watanabe	Sigh... as you wish, as long as you don't slow me down.	1
