19	19		301									Unlike other Demons, they had strange black rings on their necks, and a mysterious purple light in their eyes.

22	22		301								Liv	Bottom layer... Did that King do all of this?	1																					
23	23		301								???	Yeah, he couldn't do much due to his limited access, but more than enough to control these low-rank Demons.
