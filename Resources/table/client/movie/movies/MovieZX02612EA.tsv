4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Zero	Sage, please... please just tell me exactly what I need to do to walk down the path of revelation alongside you...	1																					
5	5		301									The mesmerized mechanoid girl chants Nanami's title as she walks up the stairs. She stares at Nanami piously like a lost fanatic pursuing the will of her god.																						
6	6		301								Zero	You healed me, Sage, yet you broke me down again... when I have cleared your path of all obstructions and brought you your favorite humans. Is it wealth you want? Or is it wisdom? I am willing to wield my sword a million times over for you, but I just can't imagine having to live with you...	1																					
7	7		301								Zero	Don't look at the Wheel of Fortune like that, Sage. Spare me some of your love. Look at me!	1																					
8	8		301								Zero	Oh... I see. Sage, is this your revelation to me?	1																					
9	9		202							1					1																			
10	10		301									Zero lowers her head and giggles.	1																					
11	11		301								Zero	The path of revelation may be beyond our ability to comprehend. But it is the path you have chosen, right, Sage?	1																					
12	12		301								Zero	If Zero can be just like Wheel of Fortune...	1																					
13	13		201							1	500468	2																						
14	14		301							1	Zero	And become a pavestone on your path of revelation...!	1																					
15	15		201							1	500477	4																						
16	16		301							1	Haicma	Nanami, she's coming at you!	1																					
17	17		202							1					1																			
18	18		301									Zero charges up to Nanami. Before Haicma could even raise her scythe, however, Power is already wielding its chainsaw out of reflection.

21	21		301							1	Zero	Uh...	1																					
22	22		301			PanelActor1Shake						The broken red heart on the girl's chest flickers. Thick, black liquid keeps flowing out from it.

24	24		204							1	2																							
25	25		301								Zero	Oh... Sage...	1																					
26	26		301									Ramming herself self-destructively into Power's weapon, Zero instantly breaks into pieces that shatter onto the ground. Zero, however, carries on mumbling, as if she were dreaming the best dream of her life.

29	29		301								Zero	I don't know what's right and wrong. Only you, Sage, can show me my path ahead...	1																					
30	30		301								Zero	If the path you have chosen will take my life away, then so be it...	1																					
31	31		301								Zero	Sage...	1																					
32	32		301									The energy pipes under her exposed chest bone blink a few times. Fluid runs across the floor. Her once clean face and coating are now full of black stains.																						
33	33		301									With her utter faith and insanity, Zero offers her heart to her princess.																						
34	34		301								Zero	I-love-you-	1

37	37		301									The mechanoid's voice begins to twist. Her right hand hangs in the air for a second, then falls down.																						
38	38		301								"Gear"	...																						
39	39		301									Nanami has no idea who started this—																						
40	40		301								"Gear"	All for... Sage...																						
41	41		301									Beginning as a hum that sounds like a spell, the chant gradually spreads out across the army of machines...																						
42	42		301								"Gear"	Sacrifice thyself... for Sage's... revelation...																						
43	43		301									Bringing to mind a tidal wave that forms over a lake from a drop of stone into the water.																						
44	44		301								"Gear"	Sacrifice thyself for Sage's revelation... Sacrifice thyself for Sage's revelation...																						
45	45		301									Mechanoids continue to gather toward Nanami, chanting their most devoted wishes.																						
46	46		301								Spuner	Run, Sage! They are out of control!																						
47	47		201							1	500477	4																						
48	48		301							1	Haicma	No... We move forward.	1																					
49	49		301									Haicma stands in front of Nanami, holding her scythe.																						
50	50		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Haicma	We take the terminal back.	1																					
51	51		202							1					1																			
52	52		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The battle starts in chaos. Mechanoids are going after Nanami like moths to the flame.																						
53	53		301								Spuner	Go on without me. I'll stay here to block the door! As long as we get there... we win, right?																						
54	54		201							1	500475																							
55	55		301							1	Nanami	But there is no door...	1																					
56	56		202							1					1																			
57	57		301								Spuner	Then I'll make one.																						
58	58		301								Spuner	A-woooooo...																						
59	59		401							2	684																							
60	60		301			RImgBg1Shake						Spooner roars as its body swells several times its original size. The mechanical parts of his entire body expand so much that they rip through his coating, exposing the inside of his chest—which is red and spewing steam like a furnace.																						
61	61		301									Burning like the sun, Spooner is now brighter than anything else to the crazed "Gear" soldiers.																						
62	62		301									He does not understand what a "terminal" is, nor does he know how to arrive at the "redemption" Nanami mentioned. But he still is, and will forever be, following her.																						
63	63		201							1	500475	4																						
64	64		301							1	Nanami	Spuner...	1																					
65	65		301			RImgBg1Shake						Nanami tries to approach Spooner with Power but is held down by a plethora of smaller mechanoids.																						
66	66		301									She stretches out her arms as hard as she can and comes within a few more centimeters of the Spooner, but just can't seem to go any further.																						
67	67		202							1					1																			
68	68		301									Spooner budges not one inch.																						
69	69		301								Spuner	Haicma!																						
70	70		401							2	10006303																							
71	71		301			RImgBg1Shake						Clang—!																						
72	72		301									The beast holds his hammer and chisel, knocking them together with all his strength. The loud noise has caught the attention of mechanoids. They swarm onto his body like rats biting a wall of steel.																						
73	73		201							1	500477	4																						
74	74		301							1	Haicma	Follow me, Nanami. We can't let this opportunity go to waste.	1

77	77		401							2	11106007																							
78	78		301									Haicma waves her scythe, shattering and knocking mechanoids away with every swing. More wounds appear on her body as she charges forward.																						
79	79		401							2	10006303																							
80	80		301			RImgBg1Shake						Clang—!																						
81	81		501							Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryLouDianNew.prefab		1																						
82	82		301									The clanks sound as though they are prompting Sagemachina to hurry along.																						
83	83		301								Haicma	Do what you must... before Spooner burns himself out.	1																					
84	84		401							2	10006303

87	87		202							1					1																			
88	88		301									As sharp as the crescent moon, the scythe in Haicma's hands finally cleared out a path to the enormous machine in the core at the "Sanctuary".																						
89	89		401							2	10006303																							
90	90		301			RImgBg1Shake						Clang—!																						
91	91		301									Haicma's left arm disconnects from her body and gets devoured by the swarm of mechanoids immediately.																						
92	92		301								Haicma	Nanami...	1																					
93	93		201							1	500475	4																						
94	94		301							1	Nanami	Haicma!	1																					
95	95		202							1					1																			
96	96		301									Nanami calls her friend's name, but she can only reach out for the cable that extends from the terminal, connecting it to the back of her neck.																						
97	97		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The crippled mechanoid holds her weapon with the only arm left. Haicma turns back and smiles at the girl that she has followed all life.																						
98	98		202							1					1																			
99	99		401							1	36																							
100	100		301		1	AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin					All the noises and chaos have disappeared. The space is filled with a dead silence.
