3	3		301								Narration	The giant killer falls right in front of you, and you finally hear the long-awaited siren.																						
4	4		301								Narration	It was an extremely dangerous night. Fortunately, it's all over—for now.																						
5	5		301									As the narrator speaks, the killer's remains decompose into ashes and disappear in the air.

8	8		301							1	Kamui	Whew...	1																					
9	9		301								Lucia	He was a tough opponent even in here...	2																					
10	10		301								Kamui	Hmm? Something is left behind...	1																					
11	11		301									Kamui reaches out into the ashes and pulls something out.																						
12	12		301									It looks like a piece of metal, with some text written on it.																						
13	13		301									To Camp Inferno Trainee:																						
14	14		301									This is the last one, come and take it. Happy Halloween :D																						
15	15		301									—George Darren Toro																						
16	16		301								Lucia	"To my trainees of Camp Inferno: This is the end, come and take it. Happy Halloween :D —George Darren Toro"...?	2																					
17	17		301								Lucia	What does that mean...?	2																					
18	18		201							2	500110	1	400																					
19	19		301							1	Ayla	George Darren Toro... Here he is!	2																					
20	20		301									Ayla searches on her terminal and shows it to everyone with excitement.																						
21	21		301								Ayla	Look! George Darren Toro was a renowned director of horror and action movies during the Golden Age. His famous works included "Hellson", "Oceanic Rim"...	2																					
22	22		204							1	1																							
23	23		301								Kamui	Oh, I love his movies! Especially when that gigantic robot punches the other gigantic monster in the face! Kaboom!	1																					
24	24		301								Kamui	Every time I watched it, I felt like winding back that punch and watching it again 10 times! Then another 10 times at 1/10 speed!	1																					
25	25		301								Kamui	Oh, he also loved making the movie props as realistic as possible. Capt thinks it makes them look fake, but I love it!	1																					
26	26		204							2																								
27	27		301								Ayla	But... "The Darkening" wasn't his movie, was it?	2																					
28	28		201							1	1031001		-400																					
29	29		301							1	Liv	I just searched for "Camp Inferno" in the database. It's a third-party funded training camp for screenwriters, and Toro was the chief instructor.	1																					
30	30		301								Ayla	I heard rumors that Toro always wrote the scripts for his own movies, then asked some random screenwriter to put their names on them. It's probably true.	2																					
31	31		201							1	500166		-400																					
32	32		301							1	Lucia	This console is probably left by Toro for his students then.	1																					
33	33		301								Lucia	But... Why?	1																					
34	34		201							1	500026		-400																					
35	35		301							1	Lee	Ayla, what kind of place is this Camp Inferno?	1																					
36	36		301								Ayla	Hmm... Let me see, a total of 57 students attended the camp, but... It just ended without any notice?	2																					
37	37		301								Ayla	Seems the project was just terminated. There was no follow-up news.	2																					
38	38		301								Lee	We need more information...	1																					
39	39		301								Ayla	Oh, this record does have a locked section that can only be unlocked after certain requirements are met.	2																					
40	40		301								Ayla	But I haven't detected any visit logs... Which means no one else except Toro has read the content inside.	2																					
41	41		201							1	1081001	1	-400																					
42	42		301							1	Kamui	It's a puzzle left by Toro! Now I'm hyped up!	1																					
43	43		301								Ayla	Kamui, let me have a look at that metal plate. Maybe I can...	2																					
44	44		301									Ayla grabs the metal plate from Kamui and carefully examines it. She then turns to you, as if she has found something.																						
45	45		301								Ayla	I knew this would have a secret layer.	2																					
46	46		301									Ayla inserts her fingers into the secret layer and pushes the metal plate open. There is a piece of paper inside.																						
47	47		301								Ayla	Stage 1... Clear.	2																					
48	48		301									Suddenly, all of you lose your vision. Soon, you cannot feel or hear anything either.
