14	14		301								Angry Aristocrat Woman	Shoo! Stop pulling on my dress with your filthy hands! Whose child is this?! Take it away!																						
15	15		301								Sobbing Commoner Woman	My love... I'm sorry... Ahh... Why did I escape alone...																						
16	16		301								Agitated Aristocrat Man	I've had enough of these pesky scums! Why are we not moving forward?! I can't stand being in the same carriage as these filthy mutts for one more second!

44	44		301								Commoner	So we're gonna be abandoned either way?! Dammit!																						
45	45		301									The commoners cowering in the corner by the door instantly exploded with rage.																						
46	46		301			RImgBg1Shake						A wail of sorrow pierces through the rioting crowd, and the source of the wail, a woman in tattered clothing, walks out of the crowd—																						
47	47		301									—And as if possessed by something unseen, she rushes for the door, tears it open, and scrambles toward the carriages in the back.																						
48	48		301								Panicking Commoner	It's full of Corrupted in the back! Someone stop her...																						
49	49		301								Anxious Aristocrat	Are you out of your mind?! C-close the door!!																						
50	50		301								Resentful Commoner	Isn't she the one who got separated from her husband...																						
51	51		301									The crowd hurries to close the door.																						
52	52		302								No, we have to save her!	53	We have to stop her.	53

57	57		201							1	1031001	14

64	64		301								Angry Aristocrat	You filthy scums! If you want to die, then go die quietly in a corner! Don't waste our oxygen!																						
65	65		301									Liv tries to get between the two fighting classes that look like they may go into a war at any second.																						
66	66		301									That is when a woman's screaming sounds from the other carriage, followed by silence.																						
67	67		201							1	1031001	14																						
68	68		301							1	Liv	...I'm sorry, Commandant. If only Lucia or Lee is here...	1

73	73		301							1	Jamilah	...Everyone, please listen to me.	3																					
74	74		301								Jamilah	I don't plan to abandon any one of you... It is not my intention for anyone to get hurt.	3																					
75	75		301								Jamilah	After the aristocrats leave, there will only be commoners left on this train. Do you understand the meaning of this?	3																					
76	76		302							1000	The peasants will be in control of this train.	79	One side of the conflict will leave this train.	80																				
77	77		204							3																								
78	78		303							1000																								
79	79	81	301								Jamilah	That's right. This train and the wealth that the aristocrats can't bring with them will all belong to the commoners, which should be enough for commoners to survive and thrive.	3																					
80	80		301								Jamilah	Correct. Both parties will be satisfied then...	3																					
81	81		204							3	4																							
82	82		301								Jamilah	But that can only happen under the premise that Babylonia accepts our deal.	3																					
83	83		301								Jamilah	If you agree, we can form an alliance and immediately destroy that black thing.	3																					
84	84		301								Jamilah	But if you decline, then this train, and that horrible thing on it, will be handed over to the Ascendants as per the aristocrats' request.	3																					
85	85		302							2000	That's a gamble, not a deal.	88	...Is that your choice?	89																				
86	86		204							3																								
87	87		303							2000																								
88	88		301								Jamilah	It was a gamble from the start.	3																					
89	89		301								Jamilah	As you can see, the aristocrats have enough power to decide the fate of Akdilek... I can only speak my heart at times of importance.	3																					
90	90		204							3	4																							
91	91		301								Jamilah	This train has been running ever since the outbreak of the virus, and everywhere we pass by has only been a pitstop for us.	3																					
92	92		301								Jamilah	Be it commoners or aristocrats, we all want to reach that terminal station... The final destination where we can call home.	3																					
93	93		301								Jamilah	And on this journey in search of peace... Many have paid the price with their sanity, including Ashlar, including me...	3

102	102		201							3	500125	4	400																					
103	103		301							1	Jamilah	It's because you've been by my side.	3																					
104	104		301								Sophia	Leader...	2																					
105	105		301								Jamilah	No matter what, this deal will decide the fate of all on this train, so I have to reach an outcome that I won't regret!	3

109	109		301							1	Liv	Commandant, what should we do now...	1																					
110	111		302								Now's not the time to fight.	112	Let's wait for Lucia and Lee.	114																				
111	112	115	301								Liv	It's true that I alone can't defeat the enemy. Not to mention that whatever we try to do now is going to be hindered...	1																					
112	113		204							1																								
113	114		301								Liv	I know they will come back. Then we'll be able to find a way!	1
