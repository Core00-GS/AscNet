5	5		302								Morning, Sophia.	6																						
6	6		302								Assembly time is...	7																						
7	7		301								Sophia	I know it's not time yet.	1																					
8	8		301								Sophia	I meant... to arrive early.	1																					
9	9		302								What's the matter?	10																						
10	10		301								Sophia	I was... up thinking all last night.	1																					
11	11		301								Sophia	Before we leave for the mission, I wanted to ask you... Will you go on a walk with me?	1																					
12	12		301								Sophia	Is that okay?	1																					
13	13		302								Of course.	14																						
14	14		301								Sophia	There isn't much room on the Engine for walking around.	1																					
15	15		301								Sophia	Mr. Aston says it's a waste of space on the Engine.	1

21	21		301									Sophia suddenly stops and stares blankly into the distance.																						
22	22		302								That's..?	23																						
23	23		201							1	500127																							
24	24		301							1	Sophia	It's a transport craft preparing for departure.	1																					
25	25		301								Sophia	It's a regular shipment of helium-3 to Asslam... Today's the first one.	1																					
26	26		302								Homesick?	27

32	32		301							1	Sophia	Commandant, I've been trying to figure out your team's tactics...	1																					
33	33		301								Sophia	I think if I have enough time to acquire combat experience and tech from your team, maybe I can learn something useful... Something useful for Jamilah.	1																					
34	34		301								Sophia	But I don't think now is the right time.	1																					
35	35		301								Sophia	Because what I hear Lucia, Liv and Lee talk about most... Isn't your leadership and combat skills, but other things.	1																					
36	36		301								Sophia	Like... your card playing, artistic taste... You seem to know them just as well. That shows how close you all are.	1																					
37	37		301								Sophia	Ja... Someone told me that leaders need to care about their people, but they can't be too close. Otherwise, it'll affect their ability to make decisions.	1																					
38	38		301								Sophia	So I concluded that your behavior was foolish and dangerous.	1																					
39	39		301								Sophia	But from what I saw, this is completely inconsistent with the Gray Ravens' performance in battle. This makes me believe that what you have may be different from what I once knew.	1																					
40	40		301								Sophia	All I can confirm is that your team is highly effective.	1																					
41	41		301								Sophia	This made me... change my judgment.	1																					
42	42		301								Sophia	So my conclusion is, please allow me to stay here.	1																					
43	43		301								Sophia	Let me continue to be a part of your team... so I can learn how you communicate with each other.	1																					
44	44		301								Sophia	Before I left, Jamilah told me...	1																					
45	45		301								Sophia	"I hope what comes back is no longer my sword or my doll, but a girl who sees the world for what it truly is."	1																					
46	46		301								Sophia	I think this may be what Jamilah wants me to do.	1																					
47	47		302								...(Laugh)	48																						
48	48		301								Sophia	...? Did I say something funny?	1																					
49	49		302								No, it's just...	50																						
50	50		302								Of course, you can, Sophia.	51																						
51	51		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Sophia	...Understood.	1

55	55		301								Letter	I didn't transfer, so I didn't get any leave.																						
56	56		301								Letter	So I can't come back yet. Say hello to Aston... and Changyu.
