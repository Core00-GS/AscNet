4	5		301							1	Noan	...A gift for Double Seventh Festival... Double Seventh Festival?	1																					
5	6		302								Do you know about it?	8																						
6	7		204							1	2																							
7	8		301								Noan	Yeah. I've met my share of people from Kowloong before. They mentioned their customs and the story behind it, but I never saw them celebrate it.	1																					
8	9		204							1	1																							
9	10		301								Noan	Thank you, then. I didn't know you were supposed to give gifts on this day. I would have prepared something for you otherwise.	1																					
10	11		302								It's fine. It's just a club activity, anyway. Let's open it!	12																						
11	12		301									Noan nods and opens the box, taking out a half-green, half-red... apple.																						
12	13		204							1	9																							
13	14		301								Noan	An apple? But why? And this color... Is this a Snow White reference?	1																					
14	15		302								Those people must have had some wild ideas.	18																						
15	16		204						500	1	10																							
16	17		204							1	11																							
17	18		301								Noan	I know Constructs don't need to eat... but seeing that this is a gift, it's not right for me to give it away. What about this? We'll each eat half of it like the story.	1																					
18	19		204							1	1																							
19	20		301								Noan	But since the red part is poisonous in most stories, I'll take the "poisonous" part.	1																					
20	21		301									He splits the apple in two and hands you the fluorescent green half.																						
21	22		302								Alright.	23																						
22	23		301									Taking the half he hands you, you take a bite, and a lime-like sourness explodes in your mouthâ€”is this a way the club is trying to punish the "villain" in the story?																						
23	24		302								...I-it's so sour!	25																						
24	25		204							1	9																							
25	26		301								Noan	What? How can that be? Uh... Here, take mine instead. We'll trade.	1																					
26	27		301									Guiltily he hands you his half of the apple instead and takes yours away.																						
27	28		204							1	4																							
28	29		301								Noan	How about this one?	1																					
29	30		301									You take a bite under Noan's watchful eyes. This half is sweet as an apple should be.																						
30	31		302								This is delicious.	32																						
31	32		204							1	1																							
32	33		301								Noan	I'm glad...	1																					
33	34		301									He breathes a sigh of relief before calmly eating the sour half.																						
34	35		302								...Don't you think it's bad?	36																						
35	36		301								Noan	It's a bit sour, but it's acceptable. I've eaten many similar things in the past, and, more importantly, I don't want to waste this gift.	1																					
36	37		301									Smiling, he takes out a small glass vial from his pocket. Inside the vial is a strand of rice.																						
37	38		302								...Rice? That can't be, can it?	39																						
38	39		301								Noan	It's barnyard grass. It looks like rice, but it's far less valuable and steals nutrition away. It's considered a harmful plant if it appears in one of the experimental farms and needs to be removed.	1																					
39	40		301								Noan	This one got lucky and didn't get removed, and here it is, all grown up.	1																					
40	41		301								Noan	Here, take it in exchange for the apple. It's not something valuable... and I just happened to be carrying it with me.	1																					
41	42		301									With an inquisitive smile, he places the glass vial in your hand.																						
42	43		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Noan	Will you let it stay here... with you?	1
