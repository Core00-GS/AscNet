26	33		301									Wanshi puts one end of the connecting wire into the hands of the Construct in front of him and plugs the other end into his terminal. His fingers quickly taps on it, and a weak current is transmitted along the wire to the Construct.

37	1002		401							1	203																							
38	44		301								Thompson	Careful, it's the Corrupted that crossed the front line with special camouflage.	2

42	48		301							1	Thompson	No, there's no way we can handle a Corrupted of this caliber in our current state.	1																					
43	49		301								Thompson	Wanshi, just get away through the back door. At least we Constructs can recall.	1

54	59		301								Jett	Yeah. We knew what the ending would be after seeing the truth beneath the lies.	1																					
55	60		301								Jett	To die for humans is the inevitable end for Constructs.	1																					
56	61		301								Jett	The only difference is when and where you die.	1

62	67		301								Wanshi	Get rid of the wounded frame and let your M.I.N.D. return to Babylonia.

99	101		301							1	Wanshi	I... will not let you recall...	1																					
100	102		301								Wanshi	I thought I exposed the lies to help others in the past. Instead, I created more suffering.	1																					
101	103		301								Wanshi	Since then, my life has been filled with regrets, helplessness, compromises, and torture.	1																					
102	104		301								Wanshi	Because... I accepted the reality that such a lie needs to exist...	1																					
103	105		301								Wanshi	But what happened here has made me realize that Constructs should never be kept in the dark and sacrificed in vain...	1																					
104	106		301								Wanshi	If I don't reveal the truth to you here, how could I face Kamui and the others on the front line? Or Thompson's child waiting in Babylonia?	1																					
105	900		301								Wanshi	I'm not telling the truth to help... but to protect.	1

113	115		201							1	500289																							
114	116		301							1	Wanshi	The threat of life and death is the same for all of us.	1																					
115	117		301								Wanshi	If I let you fight recklessly with no regard for your safety just because you are counting on recalling... that's no different from letting you commit suicide.	1																					
116	123		301								Wanshi	So right now, instead of running away, I am going to fight with you, so none of you need to be recalled.	1																					
117	901		301								Wanshi	Doctors should not only save people, but fight alongside them as well and protect others. We'll make it... together...	1																					
118	124		301									Worked up, Wanshi seems a little exhausted, and he cannot stop trembling. Thompson slowly walks over to him and gently strokes his head.

128	134		201							1	500019																							
129	135		301							1	Thompson	You're not a coward. To move forward in the painful darkness after seeing the truth is not what a coward would do. Instead, you're stronger than everyone else.	1

139	150		301								Thompson	Guys, let's go.	1																					
140	151		301									Thompson shouts out commands as he speaks. Several Constructs that can still move take out their weapons. Just as Wanshi is about to walk through the back door, Thompson throws a sniper rifle into his hands.																						
141	152		301								Thompson	Take it.	1																					
142	153		301								Thompson	Let those monsters outside see how indestructible a fully armed "flag" is.	1

144	155		301							2		Meanwhile, Thompson loads the other sniper rifle in his hand. Wanshi mimics his actions and turns the weapon's safety off.
