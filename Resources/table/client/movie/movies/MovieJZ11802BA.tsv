26	26		301								Security Guard B	Probably just another guy that was fooled by the military policy and found the salary unsatisfactory and the Construct troubling.	2																					
27	27		301								Security Guard A	Is that so?	1																					
28	28		301								Security Guard B	Yeah, did you think all the doctors are the same in the Star of Life?	2																					
29	29		301								Security Guard B	Though the ones in the Construct Maintenance Department are also called doctors, their work is more like a maintenance worker than a surgeon.	2																					
30	30		301								Security Guard B	I heard that even a minor assembly error on a Construct will have serious consequences. It must take way more effort to maintain the Constructs than to operate on humans.	2																					
31	31		301								Security Guard A	They are all staff in the Star of Life. Why don't they consider a change of position?	1																					
32	32		301								Security Guard B	It's not as easy as you think. Medical research involving human subjects is way different from Construct maintenance. It's highly unlikely that a change of position would be allowed.	2																					
33	33		301								Security Guard B	I guess that guy would end up muddling through with a small salary or find a job at Cosmos Industries.	2																					
34	34		301								Security Guard B	But it's perfectly normal. After all, they're just taking over the repetitive work that the Science Council finds tedious.	2																					
35	35		301								Security Guard A	If that's the case, why would the Star of Life keep maintaining those Constructs? Wouldn't it be better to replace the broken frame with a new one?	1																					
36	36		301								Security Guard B	Are you nuts? The broken frames will be able to fight again after being repaired and adjusted.	2																					
37	37		301								Security Guard B	It takes resources and time to build a new frame. How would you make up for the troops' shortage while waiting for the new frame? Don't tell me you wanna go fight the Corrupted with your flesh and bone.	2																					
38	38		301								Security Guard B	The current population of Babylonia is far from enough for the war.	2																					
39	39		301								Security Guard A	So it's better to be a Construct as they will never be "dead." In the worst case, they can still activate a recall.	1																					
40	40		301								Security Guard B	Then why don't you choose to be a Construct?	2

60	59		301									I have heard such happy laughter in the past. It was when chatting with a Construct after maintenance, who was hoping to return to the battlefield soon.

75	73		301									Blood keeps oozing out from the bandage on the human's chest.																						
76	74		301									The Construct is more severely injured. His arms bends at a strange angle, and the part below his waist appears to have been crushed by a heavy object, flattened and incomplete, while scarlet drops of vital fluid drips to the ground along the grooves at the edge of the nursing bed.

92	90		301									The artificial skin of the Construct is gone, and the mechanical body that should have glowed with a metallic luster is covered in scorching black from an intense burn. In his broken left leg, Wanshi can even see the traces of the metal solidigying again after liquefying from the heat.																						
93	91		301									Groans of pain keeps coming from the Construct. Wanshi turns his head aside, trying not to look at him again.

237	234		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The Construct pushes Wanshi through the corridor of the Star of Life. The route is obviously precisely planned by the Construct.																						
238	235		301									The timing of passing each corner and the time needed to traverse each corridor are all accurately calculated so that they will not attract any attention, even if a doctor of the Star of Life is being held hostage.

246	243		301								Wanshi	You...	1																					
247	244		301								Construct A	Didn't you also rebel in your way after knowing the truth behind the lie?	2

254	250		301									The Construct takes a deep breath after stepping out of the Star of Life.																						
255	251		301								Construct A	It's been a long time since I've been to a place other than the Earth and the Star of Life.	1																					
256	252		202							1					1																			
257	253		301									The Construct looks around, and two Constructs emerge from the shadows of the building, nodding at the Construct holding Wanshi.

266	262		202							1					1																			
267	263		301									A robotic voice comes out and the dark hatch of the airdrop platform opens. Rows of airdrop cabins are at both sides of the room.																						
268	264		301									The Construct that hacks into the hatch walks to the airdrop cabin and pulls the wire from his arm to connect to the terminal next to it.

280	273		301									As soon as the Construct asks, an explosive shell pierces through his chest, his vital fluid spilling all over Wanshi.

286	4003		401							2	10002001																							
287	277		301									Due to such an emergency, the Construct falls to the ground in pain. A dark dagger pierces its throat in an instant, rotates, and slashes to the other side, cutting off the Construct's neck.																						
288	278		301								Chiko	Target down.																						
289	279		201							1	500019																							
290	280		301							1	Construct A	Soren! Howard!	1

292	282		202							1					1																			
293	283		301									He takes out the weapon from behind and points it around, only to find that there is no trace of any member of the Purifying Force except for Wanshi who has fallen to the ground and the corpses of his partners.																						
294	284		301									Later, a searing pain tears through his body and the Construct falls to his knees.																						
295	285		301									The moment he falls to his knees, he reaches out and throws several black cubes around.																						
296	5011		401							2	1509																							
297	286		301									The cubes fall to the ground and connect each other, forming a pale blue power grid around to keep out the Purifying Force.

303	292		301								Construct A	...	1																					
304	293		301								Construct A	Yeah. We knew what the ending would be after seeing the truth beneath the lies.	1																					
305	294		301								Construct A	To die for humans is the inevitable end for Constructs.	1																					
306	295		301								Construct A	The only difference is when and where you die.	1																					
307	296		301								Construct A	This is the reality.	1																					
308	297		301								Wanshi	Then why did you...	2																					
309	298		301								Construct A	I'm not "you." I have a nameâ€”Jett.	1																					
310	299		301								Jett	The white-haired guy is Soren and the one who's good at hacking is Howard. We all have names.	1																					
311	300		301									The Construct called Jett reaches out to his partners who has fallen to the ground.																						
312	301		301								Jett	We fought hard from one battlefield to another. Perhaps I want to escape as I was tired of such a cycle.	1																					
313	302		301								Jett	And we did it, making our own decisions after a long time.	1																					
314	303		301								Jett	We decided to escape, even though there was nowhere to hide in the first place.	1																					
315	304		202							1	2				1																			
316	305		301									The glow of the power grid around Jett gradually fades. He holds himself up with his weapon, barely managing to stand instead of kneeling.																						
317	5010		401							2	1510																							
318	306		301			RImgBg1Shake						The light of the grid completely disappears, and another explosive shell blasts half of Jett's face.

322	310		301								Purifying Force A	Defecting Construct terminated.																						
323	311		301								Purifying Force B	Get the transporter over here and check if the human is injured.																						
324	312		301									Wanshi sees Jett stop moving and stand still. Several fully armored members of the Purifying Force walk toward Wanshi through the weakened power grid, uncuff him and help him out of the airdrop platform.																						
325	313		301								Purifying Force A	Whistleblower arrested. Checking the wounds of the captured human.																						
326	314		301								Purifying Force B	Can't believe a professor would have done this.																						
327	315		201							1	500289	7																						
328	316		301							1	Wanshi	Huh? Professor... No, it's...	1																					
329	317		202							1					1																			
330	318		301									The first thing that Wanshi sees after walking out of the airdrop platform is the professor being held in the escort car. And several members of the Purifying Force are guarding around.																						
331	319		301									The professor sits by the window of the escort car, looking depressed. He puts a hand in front of his mouth in a gesture of silence after seeing Wanshi.																						
332	320		301									Wanshi wants to say something, but the members of the Purifying Force around immediately puts him aside to check his wounds.																						
333	321		301									Wanshi sees the professor slowly lowers his hands and forces a smile at him through the crowd.																						
334	322		201							1	500289	7																						
335	323		301							1	Wanshi	Is this...	1																					
336	324		202							1					1																			
337	325		301									During this time, members of the Purifying Force keep checking on Wanshi, but he cannot answer anything.																						
338	326		301									He stares blankly at everything around. Members of the Purifying Force are getting closer, yet he finds it harder to hear their words.																						
339	327		301			RImgBg1Disable						The scene around Wanshi is covered in darkness, and he stands alone in the shadows murmuring to himself.																						
340	329		301								Wanshi	It won't be changed by rage or struggle.																						
341	330		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Wanshi	Is this... the reality beneath the lies?
