8	8		301								Lucia	Commandant, a new request for combat has come in from Babylonia.	1																					
9	9		301								Lucia	It's different from our typical missions this time... Commandant, do you know anything about the "Memory Chip"?	1																					
10	10		302								Indeed.	11	Not much.	14																				
11	11		301								Lucia	As you know, the Memory Chip is the culmination of extraordinary tactical memory data of human ancestors.	1																					
12	12		301								Lucia	As the commandant, you can equip and combine various Memory Chips for the Construct through the tactical support program to design a tactical plan.	1																					
13	13	25	301								Lucia	In this way, the Construct can make use of different tactical memory data to better deal with the changes during battles.	1

16	16		301							1	Lee	Your answer makes me wonder if we've been in a state of vacancy in the six memory slots.	2																					
17	17		302								Well, I doubt it.	18	Correct.	21																				
18	18		204							2	10																							
19	20	22	301								Lee	... Am I supposed to feel relieved now? All in all, the Memory Chip is the culmination of the extraordinary tactical memory data of our human ancestors.	2																					
20	21		301								Lee	It's something to think about whether it's the amazing luck or the inconspicuous leadership of the commandant that has gotten the Gray Raven this far.	2																					
21	22		204							1																								
22	23		301								Lee	As the commandant, you can equip and combine various Memory Chips for the Construct through the tactical support program to design a tactical plan.	2																					
23	24		301								Lee	In this way, the Construct can make use of different tactical memory data to better deal with the changes during battles.	2																					
24	25		301								Lucia	The Memory Chip tech has always been a significant and effective approach to enhance the overall battle power of Constructs.	1																					
25	26		301								Lucia	But now, it was intercepted by the Ascendants.	1																					
26	27		302								What's going on?	28																						
27	28		301								Lucia	The tactical terminal of Babylonia was recently infected by the Punishing Virus and it tore a tiny gap.	1

29	30		201							2	1011001		-400																					
30	31		301							1	Lee	The gap is extremely small. Records show that a central system has found and fixed this tiny gap in 0.03 seconds. But the gap... happens to be where the memory data is stored.	2																					
31	32		204							2	10																							
32	33		301								Lee	This was a well-planned and targeted attack, most likely initiated by the Ascendants.	2																					
33	34		204							2																								
34	35		301								Lee	Though we've isolated the memory data that was briefly exposed, only 27.7% of the memory data is guaranteed to be uncorrupted after a thorough check.	2																					
35	36		302								Things are not promising.	37	What should we do?	40																				
36	37		301								Lucia	Yes, Commandant.	1																					
37	38		301								Lucia	Fortunately, Memory Chip tech is a core tech that has been put into research since the end of the Post-Pandemic Age.	1																					
38	39	44	301								Lucia	All original data of uncorrupted memory should still be preserved in the ground tactical initially deployed on Earth.	1																					
39	40		301								Lee	There's still hope. Don't panic.	2																					
40	41		301								Lucia	Yes, Commandant. But according to the analysis of the early related records, Babylonia has acquired an important message.	1																					
41	42		301								Lucia	At the end of the Post-Pandemic Age, humans once deployed a ground tactical terminal on Earth, where it was highly likely to preserve all uncorrupted original memory data.	1																					
42	43		301								Lee	That's right.	2																					
43	44		302								Are you sure it was not corrupted?	47	Do the ascendants have any idea about this?	48																				
44	45		204							2																								
45	47	49	301								Lee	I'm not a hundred percent sure. After all, the records were too far back and a lot of information was lacking, but it's worth looking into.	2																					
46	48		301								Lee	I'm not a hundred percent sure. But even if it's a risky move, it's also the only effective way to recycle the original uncorrupted memory data in the ground tactical terminal.	2																					
47	49		302								Prepare for battle.	50	Liv?	52																				
48	50		204							2																								
49	51	53	301								Lucia	Combat mission confirmed: Detect the original memory data in the ground tactical terminal and recycle the uncorrupted data to restore functionality.	1																					
50	52		301								Lucia	Liv, have you located where the ground tactical terminal is?	1

53	55		301							1	Liv	Commandant, I've detected ten ground tactical terminals through data analysis and calculations.	1																					
54	56		301								Liv	The positioning satellite detected that there was a strong reaction of the Corrupted everywhere, but no signs of the Ascendants...	1

58	60		301							1	Lee	We have to recycle all memory data before they discover the ground tactical terminals.	3																					
59	61		301								Lee	The information and corruption analysis report of the ten Memory Chips have already been loaded into my database.	3																					
60	62		302								Prepare to move out.	63	A fight is waiting for us.	63
