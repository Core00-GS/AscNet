5	4		302								Is that okay?	5	I'll count on you.	7																				
6	5		301								Bianca	Are you asking... because of what happened with the Support Force earlier?	1																					
7	6	8	301								Bianca	Don't worry, Commandant. It'll be fine.	1

17	15		301								Bianca	The Purifying Force might not be some secret stowed away in the attic...	1																					
18	16		301								Bianca	But due to how we operate, most squads never come into contact with us.	1																					
19	17		301								Bianca	The only ones who know about our existence are the Constructs who have served for a long time.	1																					
20	18		301								Bianca	Like those from the Support Force who have seen very little combat and have never been rebooted.	1																					
21	19		301								Bianca	If the Task Force is the light, the Purifying Force is the shadow.	1																					
22	20		301								Bianca	Once the war is over and things return to normal, those of us in the Purifying Force will be rebooted as well, I think.	1																					
23	21		302								I'm not going to let them reboot you.	22	Is that really alright, Bianca?	23																				
24	22		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Bianca	Thank you, Commandant.	1																					
25	23		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Bianca	(Nods) That is alright.	1
