5	5		301									The girl in black never shows up again, but Roland sees marks of Punishing on the ground pointing to another place.																						
6	6		301									These marks aren't visible to those without Punishing affinity. Roland knows the message is specifically left for him.																						
7	7		301									The marks continue along the path, extending into the other side of the forest.

20	20		301									The girl in black calmly stands in the center of the circle on a cliff. She seems to have waited a long time.

26	26		301							1	Roland	Just do what you have to. Now that you have showed up, your plot must have come to an end.	1																					
27	27		301								Roland	Where is the villain? Whatever you have up your sleeve, bring it up. I'm ready.	1																					
28	28		301									Roland plays his last card. He is waiting for the opponent to draw their last from the bottom of the deck.

43	43		301									—A giant black shadow flies off from the cliff behind Cinderelik.																						
44	44		301									It launches upward, severing the rising moon before hovering in the air.																						
45	45		301									—Then it dives past Roland and Cinderelik, and hovers again. Its long and slim artificial muscle wings swing across the forest.

47	47		301							1	Voodoo	Is this our target? The one Mister wants to recruit?	1																					
48	48		301								Cinderelik	Yes, do what you need to do. This time, stay away from any targets unrelated to the mission.																						
49	49		301								Voodoo	Unremarkable. I, be gentle. Save, energy. Give, his, complete body, to Mister.	1

57	57		301								Voodoo	Then "Loki" will wreck havoc. You may not want to witness that.	1

71	71		301							1	Roland	...I really want to meet that "Mister" of yours.	1																					
72	72		301								Roland	If I get to see him, I'd like to make a complaint regarding this invitation.	1																					
73	73		301								Roland	The staff he sent displayed extremely poor attitudes.	1																					
74	74		301									The girl doesn't reply, only bows instead. She then waves at the black figure in the sky—																						
75	75		301								Roland	Great, we have one poker face and one maniac. Surely you don't look like you want to talk.	1																					
76	76		301								Roland	...Fine, let's use violence first.	1																					
77	77		401							2	1511

88	88		201							1	500326

90	90		301								Voodoo?	I'm free! No longer suppressed by you... This feels great! Fantastic!	1																					
91	91		301								Voodoo?	Who are we going to kill?! Who? This guy? Is it him?!	1																					
92	92		301								Voodoo	Yes. Kill him if you find him too weak. We take turns.	1
