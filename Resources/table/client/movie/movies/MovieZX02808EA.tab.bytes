17	17		301									Voodoo accelerates and climbs before retracting her wings mid-air, dashing toward Alpha. Right as she is about to hit the ground, her form shifts, and she extends her claws like a wolf, striking Alpha with her slashes.

30	30		301								Voodoo?	Haha! Die!	2																					
31	31		301									The blade on Voodoo's tail has circled around Alpha without her noticing it, waiting for its chance to pierce her heart.																						
32	32		401							2	11106008																							
33	33		301									The blade collides with metal, making a loud clash. Voodoo has killed many Constructs this way‚Äîthere is no way this will...

43	43		301									Right before she is sent flying away, Voodoo finally catches a glimpse of Alpha's move‚ÄîAlpha's mount module has used her sheath to block Voodoo's strike from behind.																						
44	44		301									It turns out Voodoo's actions have never escaped Alpha's eyes. Had Voodoo not transformed back into her winged form in time to slow herself, she would have passed out from the force of the impact.																						
45	45		201							1	500100																							
46	46		301				PanelActor1Shake			1		Right as Alpha is about to go after Voodoo, a long metal chain catches her arm.

66	66		201							1	500327																							
67	67		301							1	Voodoo	Roland! Take the stem cell and start the ship... You must complete Mister's task.	1

73	73		301								Roland	Alright, gotcha. I'll be on my way, then... Good luck!	2																					
74	74		202							2

80	80		301									Voodoo coughs out the vital fluid from her stomach and growls like an animal, her claws scraping over the floor, sending sparks flying. In the blink of an eye, she is no longer where she was, leaving behind just a blur.

84	84		301							1		Facing an enemy with incredible speed, Alpha chooses to stand still. She sheathes her katana slowly as her body shifts, lowering her center of gravity.																						
85	85		204							1	8																							
86	86		301									As Voodoo accelerates, the sound her movement causes quiets down instead. The air does not have time to be disrupted before it is split apart by her speed. Silence remains between the two opponents.																						
87	87		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					‚ÄîAlpha is certain that when the sound of her blade springing from her sheath breaks the silence, the brief flash of blade and wind will decide the fate of their fight.
