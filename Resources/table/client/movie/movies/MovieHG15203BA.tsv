4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Qu	This is where the "Tabula Akasha" collects world treasures. You should be the first human to ever set foot in this place.	1																					
5	5		302								Should I feel honored?	6																						
6	6		202							1					1																			
7	7		301									With the dull thud of the door, the Kowloong's vault is opened for the first time in a long time. Every inch of the chamber is filled with treasures collected from all over the world.																						
8	8		302								Ayla would freak if she found out...	9																						
9	9		201							1	500150																							
10	10		301							1	Qu	Of course, compared with the records of your unsightly WGAA, everything lying here is a shining example of human existence. This makes it the greatest witness of the human era.	1																					
11	11		301								Qu	Human beings may only be a flash in the pan, but the fruits of their labor will turn into fossils and remain unforgotten.	1																					
12	12		301								Qu	I know everything here. If you are interested, you can ask me about their stories if you so choose.	1																					
13	13		302								(Ask about a stone door covered in carvings)	14	(Ask about a sallow wine botte)	20																				
14	14		301								Qu	This is the stone door to the tomb of an ancient general. It's carved with every battle he fought. Artisans even carved the mane of every warhorse in fine detail.	1																					
15	15		301			PanelActor1Shake					Qu	Insolent fool! I've never allowed anyone to approach me like that!	1																					
16	16		302								I'm just trying to get a closer look...	17																						
17	17		301								Qu	Forget it. But next time... I recall an exquisite pattern on the gallows you might be interested in having a closer look at.	1																					
18	18		302								...Forget about it.	19																						
19	19	28	301								Qu	Looks like that about wraps it up here. On to the next place.	1																					
20	20		301								Qu	Did you know? Brewing alcohol predates historical records. Humanity invented it even before iron.	1																					
21	21		301								Qu	This wine in my hand here is more than a thousand years old. It's no longer drinkable, but it still carries a strong aroma.	1																					
22	22		302								(Sniff) I don't smell anything?	23																						
23	23		301								Qu	How can that be...? Has it lost its aroma?	1																					
24	24		302								I only smell jasmine.	25																						
25	25		301								Qu	That's most likely my perfume... It must have overpowered the wine's scent. It's a shame you can't smell the aroma from a thousand years ago.	1																					
26	26		302								I don't think I'm really missing out on much...	27

31	31		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Qu	This is a collection of relatively modern cultural relics. There may be some things you've seen before.	1																					
32	32		202							1					1																			
33	33		301									In the spotlight, one item seems out of place compared to the other treasures among the collection.																						
34	34		302								What's this doll...?	35																						
35	35		201							1	500150																							
36	36		301							1	Qu	This was given by an ordinary girl from Kowloong...	1																					
37	38		301									Qu gently picks up the seemingly ordinary mechanical doll. You can now see that it is a peacock. She strokes the grooves on the doll and reminisces about in memories of the past.																						
38	40		301								Qu	She wanted to see the world outside Kowloong. Her dreams came true, but her story ended in tragedy.	1																					
39	41		302								Was she a friend of yours?	42																						
40	42		301								Qu	No... I have no need for friends. Besides, she offered nothing of value as a friend.	1																					
41	43		302								Friends don't need to be of value.	44																						
42	44		301								Qu	Everything has value—much like these treasure. These are all priceless artifacts worthy of being passed down for all of eternity.	1																					
43	45		302								So, what's with the doll?	46																						
44	46		301									Qu clenches her fist around the doll, but quickly releases her grip in fear of damaging it.																						
45	47		301								Qu	This...	1																					
46	48		302								This has no material value...	49																						
47	49		301								Qu	...	1																					
48	50		302								Nor artistic value...	51																						
49	51		301								Qu	...	1																					
50	52		302								This is just an ordinary person's hopes and joys.	53																						
51	53		301								Qu	Enough...	1																					
52	54		302								You treasure it because...	55																						
53	55		301								Qu	Presumptuous fool! I command you... Shut up!	1																					
54	56		302								This proves that you really do see the value of humanity deep within your heart.	57																						
55	57		301							1		Just as you plan on continuing with your explanation, a bionic peacock suddenly flies at you, squawking and pecking at your head.																						
56	58		302								Ow!	59																						
57	59		301								Qu	Huiyu?	1																					
58	60		302								Is this your pet? Make it stop...	1000																						
59	1000		204							1	1																							
60	61		301									Qu merely just grins and shows no intention of stopping it.	1																					
61	62		301								Qu	Keep going, Huiyu! Peck harder! Make this insolent fool pay!	1																					
62	63		302								Hey! Ouch!	64																						
63	64		202							1					1																			
64	65		301								Huiyu	Kaw! Kaw—!!																						
65	66		201							1	500150																							
66	67		301							1	Qu	That's all for today. It seems that you are still a long way from becoming a qualified partner... Especially, when it comes to showing me respect.	1																					
67	68		302		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Ouch, okay! Now get this bird outta here!
