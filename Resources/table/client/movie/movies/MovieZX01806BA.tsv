136	136		301								Wanshi	Bingo.	1																					
137	137		301								Wanshi	I was the first scout to find the Red Tide tributaries and break the news to Babylonia.	1

140	140		301								Wanshi	Of course. Let's save it for another time.	1

145	145		301								Wanshi	No matter. The look on your face tells me all I need to know.	1

150	150		301								Wanshi	I understand the urgency, but implementing a strategy without knowing the whole picture...	1																					
151	151		301								Wanshi	How can they guarantee... that the Longinus Arsenal will be enough to stop the Red Tide?	1																					
152	152		302								You mean...	153																						
153	153		301								Wanshi	I mean, a wide-spread attack is the best course of action based on existing intel.	1

180	180		301								Woman	—Coming from that red liquid.	1																					
181	181		301								Woman	I knew what that meant. We've lost a lot of our people that way—either from falling in, or getting splashed and corrupted by it, stopping breathing after a few days.	1																					
182	182		301								Woman	At first, many people were drawn to it. Later, everyone understood that even if the voice of a loved one came from it, they should never get close to it.	1																					
183	183		301								Woman	Don't listen to the "siren's call."	1
