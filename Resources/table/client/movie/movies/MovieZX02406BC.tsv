6	6		301									Little people run around and chase each other. They are having fun, and the sailors don't scold them or stop them from playing.

Some hold their "sword" in a wacky yet serious stance, while some seem to be chanting a magic spell, which sounds more like a mumbled song. The evil dragon, restricted by their magic power, could do nothing but roar helplessly.																						
15	15		301									As the children play, they add more flavors to their epic adventures and stories. And as they are tucked into bed, the happy endings of fairytales put them to sleep. The ancient calamity has no power here. It cannot haunt these children in their dreams.

17	17		301									When the last ray of sunlight disappears into the horizon, the captain gives his command as the helmsman steers the ship and sailors hoist the flag. The anchor has been pulled back on the deck.
