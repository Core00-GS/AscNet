5	5		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						"Knock"... "Knock"...																						
6	6		301									Someone is knocking on the door to the bedroom in the dead of night... albeit very gently as if trying not to startle the people inside the room.																						
7	7		301									Not getting any response, a girl with black hair pokes her head from behind the door.																						
8	8		301								Mother	Lucia?																						
9	9		301									Not expecting to get discovered, the girl looks at her mother, her large eyes blinking.																						
10	10		201							1	500339																							
11	11		301							1	Lucia	Did I wake you, Mom...?	1																					
12	12		301									Lucia's mother simply smiles and waves at her.																						
13	13		202							1					1																			
14	14		301								Mother	Come on in. Look at you all sneaky, like you're about to steal some snacks.																						
15	15		301									Embarrassed, Lucia walks in with a picture book in her hands.																						
16	16		301								Mother	Do you want a bedtime story? Come on, then.																						
17	17		301									Lucia nods eagerly before quickly walking toward her mother, only to stop halfway through.																						
18	18		301								Mother	Hm? What's wrong? My Lucia is getting shy...																						
19	19		301									Lucia shakes her head and points at her mother's growing bellyâ€”her mother is pregnant.																						
20	20		201							1	500339																							
21	21		301							1	Lucia	Dad said the baby inside you is very fragile. I don't want to get too close...	1																					
22	22		301								Mother	That's alright. Maybe the baby wants a story too.																						
23	23		301								Lucia	Really?	1																					
24	24		301									Lucia smiles again, carefully approaching her mother and handing her the book.																						
25	25		301									Seeing how funny Lucia looks, being both scared and curious, Lucia's mother grabs her daughter's hand and places it on her belly.																						
26	26		301									The gentle movement inside her mother can be felt with her hand. For the first time, the young Lucia truly feels the existence of life.																						
27	27		301								Lucia	Mom! Something's moving! It's moving!	1																					
28	28		301									Her mother smiles, holding up the picture book before frowning.																						
29	29		301								Mother	Ah? The story with the Moon and the rabbits again? Haven't you heard it enough times from your dad already?																						
30	30		301								Lucia	B-but the baby hasn't heard it before!	1																					
31	31		301									Lucia's mother pats Lucia on her head, recalling how Lucia was once a fragile life inside her not too long ago. Now, here her daughter is, starting a life of her own in this world.																						
32	32		301								Mother	You really like this story, don't you...? How about we name the baby "Luna", like the Moon, if the baby is a girl?																						
33	33		301								Lucia	Does the Moon have a name too?	1																					
34	34		301								Mother	It does. People always name the things that are important to them. Do you like that name, Lucia?																						
35	35		301									Luna... Luna... Lucia recites the name silently over and over again.																						
36	36		301								Mother	You're going to be a sister, whether the baby's a girl or a boy... You have to protect them and be their role model, okay? You have to walk on the right path and be a good person.																						
37	37		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Lucia nods solemnly, accepting her duty and her title as a "sister," even if she does not completely understand her mother's words.

43	43		301							1	Lucia	I'll never leave you, no matter what you've become...	1																					
44	44		201							1	500322																							
45	45		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Lucia	I'll still stand with Commandant and Gray Ravenâ€”I will find the answer I am looking for. So, Luna...	1

49	49		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Luna slowly opens her eyes. She thinks she just had a dream, but she does not remember what it was aboutâ€”it has been a very long time since she last dreamt.																						
50	50		301									Now awake, she finds herself still inside this dimly lit laboratory. As her memories return, she remembers that she is but a walking dead imprisoned on the Moon.																						
51	51		301									Someone is moving... She has gotten used to the many technicians being around her and doing all kinds of tests and experiments, but there is only one person today.																						
52	52		201							1	500494	12																						
53	53		301							1	Karenina	Hey there...	1																					
54	54		301									Finding Luna waking up, Karenina casually greets the caged girl before returning to her work.																						
55	55		301									She is going through the power nodes of the Mega-Omega Weapon one by one, inspecting them and taking out the specialized parts from within, replacing them with regular components.																						
56	56		301									Noticing Luna's gaze, Karenina shakes the tools in her hands.																						
57	57		301								Karenina	I'm swapping them with regular parts, so the Kurono people can still repair the Omega Weapon even when they don't know how it works... Won't affect its structure and power, though, so don't even think about escaping.	1																					
58	58		201							1	500238	3																						
59	59		301							1	Luna	Hmph...	1																					
60	60		201							1	500494	12																						
61	61		301							1	Karenina	I'm going to try to conceal as much of the Omega Weapon's technology and data as possible in case the Kurono people find out about them in the future. Not that I think this can keep them away for long.	1																					
62	62		201							1	500238	4																						
63	63		301							1	Luna	And I thought you were working together... It is human nature to be mistrustful, I suppose.	1																					
64	64		201							1	500494	4																						
65	65		301							1	Karenina	Even trusting those madmen once is too much for me... I don't want anything to do with them in the future.	1																					
66	66		204							1	12																							
67	67		301									Karenina hesitates for a second before deciding to continue.																						
68	68		301								Karenina	The fight on the surface is over for now, and my job here is done. I'll be back on Babylonia tomorrow.	1																					
69	69		301									Luna takes a look at Karenina, seemingly unsurprised. She has guessed so from what Karenina said.																						
70	70		201							1	500238	4																						
71	71		301							1	Luna	Is that so... Given how relaxed you look, I reckon the humans have survived another calamity.	1																					
72	72		201							1	500494	13																						
73	73		301							1	Karenina	They have indeedâ€”sorry to disappoint you. The new specialized frame we built with the information we got from you made it in time. Liv tore through the battlefield with a ray of light, saving everyone on the surface...	1																					
74	74		301									Karenina bites her lips without realizing it, chuckling wryly.																						
75	75		301								Karenina	Still, it was a Pyrrhic victory... More people are killed by the Hetero-Creatures, and more homes flooded by the Red Tide.	1																					
76	76		301								Karenina	Regardless, we have kept a spark to fight back at the very least... The power that we createdâ€”that science createdâ€”has saved everyone for once.	1																					
77	77		301								Karenina	The Task Force took the largest hit, but everyone has survived, even the Gray Ravens, who were the most injured...	1																					
78	78		201							1	500238	4																						
79	79		301							1	Luna	Gray Raven...	1																					
80	80		301									That is the team that Lucia, her other sister in Babylonia, and the commandant who dragged her from the Polyphage belong to.																						
81	81		301								Luna	Lucia is still alive, and she saved a lot of people.	1																					
82	82		301									Luna knows more than anyone how weak humans are, so she is even more surprised to witness their strength time and time again.																						
83	83		301								Luna	Even after all the despairs she's been through, Lucia is still fighting for hope...	1																					
84	84		201							1	500494	1																						
85	85		301							1	Karenina	Of course she is.	1																					
86	86		301									Karenina fixes the last component before stretching her arms.																						
87	87		204							1	13																							
88	88		301								Karenina	Lucia is strong. I know it better than most as her true rival... As long as someone believes in her, she will stand and defy any kind of fate.	1																					
89	89		301								Karenina	I'm impressed by her... but I also want to surpass and defeat her. Perhaps I couldn't do it before, butâ€”much like humanity's battle with the Punishing Virusâ€”no one loses forever.	1																					
90	90		301									Ungrounded confidence and unfounded convictions... Luna would have easily torn apart Karenina's fantasy with the calculations she got from the Ascension-Network.																						
91	91		301									But Luna is just an empty shell of conflicts now. She has no direction, no beliefs, and no future... And yet, she still has a yearning.																						
92	92		301									Had the girl named Luna not been born into this world... Lucia would not have gotten hurt protecting her sister. She would have had a different future.																						
93	93		301									Karenina watches Luna silently and speaks softly as if she has read Luna's thoughts.																						
94	94		301								Karenina	Information regarding agents is highly classified, whether in Kurono or Babylonia... Your existence will never be known, I suppose. No one will know what has happened here. Not even Lucia.	1																					
95	95		201							1	500238	1																						
96	96		301							1	Luna	I see... I don't think the name "Luna" needs to exist anywhere anymore.	1																					
97	97		301									Luna smiles gently without realizing it as if what she just said was the best news she could have hoped for.																						
98	98		201							1	500494	12																						
99	99		301							1	Karenina	I don't think I'll see you again, but still. See you.	1																					
100	100		201							1	500238																							
101	101		301							1	Luna	...See you.	1																					
102	102		204							1	3																							
103	103		301									The laboratory returns to silence after Karenina is gone. Luna closes her eyes once againâ€”perhaps time would pass more quickly in her dreams, thought the undying agent.																						
104	104		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Luna	Lucia...	1
