511	513		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Asimov	Regardless, Liv's infection rate has passed the threshold. It's very dangerous.	13																					
512	514		301								Asimov	We'll have to assess whether or not we can repair her M.I.N.D. once you return.	13																					
513	515		302								Alright.	516																						
514	516		301								Asimov	Best we let her change back into the Eclipse frame.	13																					
515	517		302								As long as she can wake up.	518																						
516	518		301								Asimov	...	13																					
517	519		301								Asimov	Come home. This is just the beginning. Lowering her infection rate, locating her M.I.N.D. shards... we have tons to do.	13																					
518	520		301								Asimov	Luckily, she was only seriously infected for a short period of time. There is still a chance.	13																					
519	521		301								Asimov	If it had lasted any longer, the data current would have shredded her M.I.N.D. and pulled the fragments into the stream.	13																					
520	522		301								Asimov	We'll also need to inspect how much the woken Constructs have recovered their consciousnesses.	13																					
521	523		301								Asimov	Miracles do not come cheaply. It's too early to call it a victory before we've finished any of these tasks.	13

523	525		301								Hassen	At least we have three pieces of good news.	13																					
524	526		301								Hassen	Liv still has a chance to recover.	13																					
525	527		301								Hassen	With the twins gone, attacks from the flying Hetero-Creatures have become less frequent.	13																					
526	528		301								Hassen	And... the Omega Weapon and the specialized frame worked. Humanity finally has a chance to strike back.	13																					
527	529		301								Hassen	Each one of them is great news to us.	13																					
528	530		301								Hassen	How are the rest of you holding up?	13

530	532		301							1	Lucia	Sophia helped repair my frame after she woke up. Frame integrity holding at 63.1%. All basic functions are intact.	1

532	534		301							1	Lee	Chrome and I have our infections cleared, but neither of our frames has been completely repaired yet.	1																					
533	535		301								Hassen	Rest assured. The Parliament will compensate for the delayed rescue.	13																					
534	536		301								Hassen	We just couldn't justify the lives that would be sacrificed then.	13

536	538		301							1	Chrome	I understand.	1																					
537	539		301								Hassen	Then, I'll be eagerly waiting for your return.	13
