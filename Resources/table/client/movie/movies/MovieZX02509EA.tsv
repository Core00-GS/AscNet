3	3		301			DialogEnable						The short contest—maybe "performance" is a better description—quickly comes to an end. Pulao stands in the center alone, surrounded by the moaning of Gung-hoers.																						
4	4		301								MC Solar	Ouch... Bro, no, sis, we're sorry. Please stop beating us.																						
5	5		301								MC Solar	We just want to make a living.																						
6	6		301								Pulao	You can make a living in many ways. Why bully others?																						
7	7		301								MC Solar	Being the Gung-hoers is just a job. Music is our life.																						
8	8		301								MC Solar	You see, we had some music test...																						
9	9		301								Pulao	You mean taste?																						
10	10		301								MC Solar	Right, music taste.																						
11	11		301								MC Solar	We had some music taste, so we got confident. We started a band, hoping to become prominent.																						
12	12		301								MC Solar	But our dream was only a dream. The interviewer only cared about looks, not your performance.																						
13	13		301								MC Solar	We tried to sing our songs, but no one seemed to cherish them. We had no supporters, so we had to go backstage.																						
14	14		301								MC Solar	No longer musicians, we became their pets. We did everything to survive, even had to mime.																						
15	15		301									As he speaks, the other three also let out a long sigh.																						
16	16		301								MC Solar	We were sick of kneeling to the capital. We wanted to fight the big people.																						
17	17		301								MC Solar	Reality gave us a hard lesson. Not everybody had the right to pursue their dreams.																						
18	18		301								MC Solar	But without music, all we had left was violence. We turned our dreams into weapons.																						
19	19		301								MC Solar	We have already plead guilty to our crime, but who can say this world is perfectly right?																						
20	20		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Pulao	Um... It makes some sense, but I feel like he's just finding excuses.

33	33		301								Pulao	What do you mean, Master? Are you leaving me alone?	2																					
34	34		301								Master	It's only a matter of time before you take over the club. As a future "Master", you should decide what to do with these people.	1

41	41		301								Pulao	You said being the Gung-hoers was just a job. If I give you a new job, can you stop harassing the city?	2

50	50		301								Pulao	Yeah. Having power isn't necessarily a bad thing.	2

56	56		301									Pulao quickly steps forward, trying to stop MC Solar's strange action. To her surprise, he is moving extremely fast, as if her words have revitalized him. He continues to run from Pulao and shouts in the martial arts club.
