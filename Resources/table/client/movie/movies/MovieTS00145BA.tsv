94	94		301								Bianca	They can't cure the Punishing Virus.	1																					
95	95		301								Bianca	True. Virus activity does decrease when in contact with the antigen... in the beginning.	1																					
96	96		301								Bianca	It doesn't take long for the virus to reactivate. And then you have to replenish another wave of antigen to suppress the viral activity for a short while.	1
