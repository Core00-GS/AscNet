4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Liv	Based on the calendar used by humanity in the past, we're approaching the "Winter Solstice".	1																					
5	5		301								Liv	The so-called "Winter Solstice" means the end of autumn and the beginning of winter. It's also when Earth reaches its closest proximity to the sun, with sunlight shining directly on the Tropic of Capricorn.	1																					
6	6		301								Liv	This day will be the shortest day of the year—	1																					
7	7		301								Liv	So humans have always cherished this special day.	1																					
8	8		204							1	1																							
9	9		301								Liv	But the primary reason isn't just purely based on astronomical data, but rather on the warmth of culture and tradition.	1																					
10	10		204							1																								
11	11		301								Liv	Apparently, "Christmas" was originally established to commemorate the birthday of a religious prophet.	1																					
12	12		301								Liv	Later, it gradually evolved into a holiday when people can relax and liberate themselves after working hard for the entire year.	1																					
13	13		301								Liv	People were said to prepare all kinds of decorations, food and gifts the day before.	1																					
14	14		301								Liv	Christmas Eve symbolizes peace and serenity with the coming of the new year.	1																					
15	15		301								Liv	In the past, people would prepare milk and cookies, go to bed, and wait for Santa Claus to climb down their chimney and place gifts under the Christmas tree.	1																					
16	16		204							1	6																							
17	17		301								Liv	...	1																					
18	18		301								Liv	Well, I'm sure the commandant would be very happy to receive my gift.	1																					
19	19		204							1																								
20	20		301								Liv	But... I'm a little embarrassed. Is this really worthy of being called a gift? Will the commandant think I'm just being coy...	1

38	35		301								Lucia	(Sighs) Guess we have no other choice but to tell you.	2																					
39	36		301								Lucia	Here's the situation, Commandant. Something seems to be on Liv's mind recently.	2																					
40	37		301								Lucia	It's not affecting her M.I.N.D. stability, but I'm worried that it's affecting her performance on missions.	2																					
41	38		204							1	10																							
42	39		301								Lee	Agreed. After all, we've already been notified about the start time for our next mission.	1																					
43	40		204							1																								
44	41		301								Lucia	So I've been thinking about how to cheer Liv up.	2																					
45	42		204							2	1																							
46	43		301								Lucia	I know you've been really busy recently, so I was just discussing it with Lee. I wasn't expecting to drag you into this.	2																					
47	44		302								We're a team.	45																						
48	45		204							2																								
49	46		301								Lee	You should've taken the commandant into consideration, Lucia.	1

51	48		301								Lucia	Sorry, Commandant! I just don't want you to worry about us.	1																					
52	49		302								It's alright.	50																						
53	50		204							2																								
54	51		301								Lee	Now then, Lucia, fill the commandant in with everything you just told me. After all, our decision is up to the commandant anyway.	1

59	56		301			AniZhuanchangEnd					Lucia	That day, as usual, I went to Liv's room to ask her about maintenance.																						
60	57		301								Lucia	But seeing her frown, I figured I'd find something else to talk about and put her heart at ease.																						
61	58		301								Lucia	—Speaking of, everyone's always out on missions. We don't have any time for a break. I'm sure you'd be happy with a vacation, right?																						
62	59		301								Lucia	That really got her attention.																						
63	60		201							1	1031001	1																						
64	61		301							1	Liv	Vacation...? Feels like I haven't heard that word in ages.	1																					
65	62		204							1																								
66	63		301								Lucia	Well, we belong on the battlefield. It's not like the Corrupted ever take a day off.																						
67	64		301								Lucia	However—the missions haven't been as urgent recently. I'm sure if you talked with the commandant... you could get some time off.																						
68	65		204							1	7																							
69	66		301								Liv	...Even you take time off, Lucia? But if it was a real vacation, then... Um...	1																					
70	67		204							1	1																							
71	68		301								Liv	That reminds me! Speaking of vacation, it's almost "that time"!	1																					
72	69		301								Lucia	"That time"?																						
73	70		301								Liv	Christmas! It only comes once a year! When humans still lived on the surface, everyone always looked forward to it!	1																					
74	71		301								Liv	Whenever someone would mention a holiday vacation, it was always during Christmas!	1																					
75	72		204							1																								
76	73		301								Lucia	I heard that Christmas used to be a festival to commemorate the birth of a prophet. At least, that's what that "Sister" told me.																						
77	74		301								Lucia	But I've never celebrated Christmas...																						
78	75		301								Liv	So it goes like this... Every Christmas, the entire city becomes alive and bustling.	1																					
79	76		301								Lucia	Um... Like when refugees run away during an air strike?																						
80	77		301								Liv	...Only you'd put it like that, Lucia. Um... No. It's not like that. Around Christmas time, everyone is relaxed, cheerful, and stress-free.	1																					
81	78		204							1	1																							
82	79		301								Liv	Christmas trees line the streets, colorful lights decorate houses, and parents prepare gifts for their children...	1																					
83	80		301								Liv	Children go play outside in the snow and have snowball fights until someone calls them back home for Christmas Eve dinner.	1																					
84	81		301								Liv	Everyone gets together to eat and talk. It may seem small, but it's a time of joy.	1																					
85	82		301								Lucia	Seems like you sure have some fond memories.																						
86	83		204							1	14																							
87	84		301								Liv	Well... its not like that. I don't remember my family ever celebrating Christmas...	1																					
88	85		301								Lucia	...Why?																						
89	86		301								Liv	I... I don't know.	1																					
90	87		301								Liv	I just remember always being jealous of the kids from normal families. I always wanted to celebrate Christmas with my family just like them...	1																					
91	88		301								Lucia	...																						
92	89		301								Liv	It's sad to think about it. Now that I'm a Construct, I'll never have a chance to be with my family, let alone celebrate Christmas with them.	1																					
93	90		301								Lucia	Well, you can ask the commandant to have some time off.																						
94	91		204							1

107	104		301								Lee	But didn't you already give Liv advice?	1																					
108	105		301								Lee	Like ask the commandant for some time off?	1																					
109	106		301								Lee	It's a strange concept to me, but maybe combining work and rest will be more beneficial for performing missions.	2																					
110	107		204							1	10																							
111	108		301								Lee	And this is also a good opportunity for our team members to get a better understanding of each other. Removing social barriers between each other should prove beneficial to future operations.	1

118	115		301								Lucia	...What are you saying, Commandant?	2																					
119	116		302								Did I say anything about not celebrating Christmas?	117																						
120	117		301								Lucia	...Understood. You're right. Babylonia hasn't imposed any restrictions over mission control. As long as circumstances permit, holding a Christmas celebration won't affect our mission.	2																					
121	118		301								Lee	Speaking of which, I've confirmed that the next mission will be located in a town in the northern region of what was once Russia.	1																					
122	119		301								Lee	It's just a simple recon mission. As long as we proceed with caution, we won't encounter any large groups of Corrupted. There shouldn't be any safety concerns.	1																					
123	120		301								Lee	The location appears satisfactory.	1																					
124	121		301								Lucia	Location?	2																					
125	122		301								Lee	Lucia... You can't have Christmas without snow. Correct?	1																					
126	123		301								Lucia	...Really? Think Hassen took this into consideration when he assigned us to the mission?	2
