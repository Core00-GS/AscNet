35	33		301									Gabriel looks down coldly from the rafters of the shaft as if waiting for the opportune moment to strike them midair.																						
36	34		301									Regardless, being attacked by Gabriel midair is preferable over drowning in the Red Tide.																						
37	35		301									Chrome takes out the rope, quickly grabs his comrades, then leaps into the air.																						
38	36		301									Right as Gabriel is about to strike the coupling, the feeling of indescribable oppression comes from above. He takes two steps back, then looks up with Cinderelik and salutes.																						
39	37		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				???	What brings Babylonia here?

41	39		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Chrome looks up to see a man dressed in black appear on the upper edge of the platform lift.																						
42	40		301								Gabriel	Give me some more time. I've got this under control.																						
43	41		301								???	No matter. I'm just here to see who's giving you so much trouble.																						
44	42		301								Gabriel	Sorry for the delay.																						
45	43		301									He looks at Strike hawk hanging from the rope as if any move they make will be met with repercussions.																						
46	44		301								Cinderelik	Mr. Gabriel left them for me to get some combat training.																						
47	45		301									Cinderelik's salute and indifferent expression make it seem as if she is merely facing a teacher rather than the mighty power of an agent.																						
48	46		301								???	And the results of said training?																						
49	47		301								Gabriel	They're almost as strong as Gray Raven. Cinderelik's failure is to be expected.																						
50	48		301								???	Oh... I recall you mentioning that team.																						
51	49		301									He smiles with great interest and takes a serious look at the person in front of him.																						
52	50		301								???	I hope they are worthy of your recommendation.																						
53	51		301									Standing on high ground, he waves his hand at Gabriel.																						
54	52		301								???	Enough. See to your guest. She's looking for you.																						
55	53		301								Gabriel	...It's her.																						
56	54		301								???	Correct.																						
57	55		301								???	I've enhanced your frame. Don't let her get the best of you like last time.																						
58	56		301								Gabriel	I won't let you down, Mr. Vonnegut.																						
59	57		301								Chrome	Isn't that the name of... that writer?																						
60	58		301									The agent by the name of Vonnegut turns to Chrome, then puts his index finger to his lips as if gesturing "Shhh."																						
61	59		301								Vonnegut	That's a secret.																						
62	60		301									He withdraws several steps and gestures them to approach.																						
63	61		301								Vonnegut	Come. Hanging on a rope is not my way of treating guests.																						
64	62		301									Seeing them remain where they hang, he smiles as if to welcome them.																						
65	63		301								Vonnegut	You don't think I'm going to catch you off guard, do you?																						
66	64		301								Chrome	...																						
67	65		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Vonnegut	Well then, come on now.

69	67		301			AniZhuanchangEnd	AniZhuanchangBegin					The trio quickly climbs up the rope to the top of the platform lift. Vonnegut once again gives them a welcoming gesture, like that of a kind and dignified lord receiving guests at his estate.

72	70		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Vonnegut	Welcome to my temporary base. I assumed Alpha was going to bring the Gray Raven Gabriel has mentioned. I wasn't expecting the likes of you.	1																					
73	71		301								Vonnegut	But considering that Gabriel advocates on your behalf, I'm inclined to trust his intuition.	1																					
74	72		203							1	0.25	450																						
75	73		201							2	500155		-450																					
76	74		301							1	Chrome	Alpha? You mean the Ascendant that serves Luna?	2																					
77	75		301									Hearing this name, Chrome's palms begin to sweat. If Alpha is here too, she is likely to be with Luna.																						
78	76		301									If they can locate Luna, 【kuroname】 will be free of some suspicion...																						
79	77		301								Vonnegut	Hm? Seems like you've still got a lot to learn about her.	1																					
80	78		301									Chrome had received intel on the Ascendants prior to the mission. However, the report on Alpha only stated that she serves Luna and that the two are sisters. As for her combat ability, it was only marked with [WARNING] in red letters.																						
81	79		301									If such a powerful Ascendant wanted to destroy them, why would Alpha let them waltz right into the base?																						
82	80		301									As if noticing Chrome's contemplation, Vonnegut begins to speak of Luna.																						
83	81		301								Vonnegut	I once saw Luna long ago.	1																					
84	82		301								Vonnegut	She was an outstanding agent. Prior to that, she worked diligently to carry out responsibilities entrusted to her by Ascnet.	1																					
85	83		301								Vonnegut	Additionally, having been selected as an agent during its preliminary development, she was able to witness the evolution of Ascnet.	1																					
86	84		301								Chrome	The evolution of the Ascension-Network... You mean it's stronger than before?	2																					
87	85		301								Vonnegut	Correct. It's not only more powerful but also more stringent in its demands for selecting agents.	1																					
88	86		301								Vonnegut	Even though the concept of agents has changed, no one can deny her credit as a pioneer.	1																					
89	88		301								Vonnegut	And to that, we owe our gratitude to Luna.	1																					
90	89		301								Vonnegut	Now, she is most likely no longer eligible to serve as an agent...	1																					
91	90		301								Vonnegut	But as one of our predecessors, not only has she aided in the evolution of the Ascension-Network, she has also been diverting humanity's firepower away from us, allowing the later generation of agents to remain hidden from view.	1																					
92	91		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Chrome	She's been diverting their firepower?	2

98	97		201							1	500101																							
99	98		301				AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Gabriel	Of course. Ever since Miss Luna became an agent right under Babylonia's nose, humanity has coveted her power.	1

104	103		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Chrome	If agents are as strong as you claim, why worry about being pursued by humanity?	2																					
105	104		301								Vonnegut	Do you think Earth fears humanity?	1																					
106	105		301								Vonnegut	Most of humanity spreads, devours, pollutes, and destroys the Earth like a virus. They are full of cruel and cunning ideas, allowing them to find their way into every nook and cranny.	1																					
107	106		301								Vonnegut	These people were responsible for the zero-point reactor meltdown that created the Punishing Virus.	1																					
108	107		301								Vonnegut	Not only that, Earth has nearly perished several times at the hands of humanity over the course of its long history.	1																					
109	108		301								Vonnegut	Even ignoring history, I'm sure you have experienced numerous disasters caused by humanity.	1																					
110	109		301								Vonnegut	Therefore, we must separate the sheep from the goats, as the shepherds do, and bury the wicked in the shadow of history. Only then can the world endure the Long Winter and, one day, welcome the coming warmth of spring.	1																					
111	110		301									He stretches out his hand as if acting out an all too familiar script.																						
112	111		301								Vonnegut	Until then, the whole world still fears the follies of man. Of course, agents must tread with equal heedfulness. Should they not?	1																					
113	112		301									He appears calm and speaks at ease. Although he says that they should "fear the follies of man," there is no look of tension or fear.																						
114	113		301									Standing among the group, he has the demeanor of an astute orator calmly sharing pearls of knowledge gathered through personal anecdotes.																						
115	114		301								Vonnegut	Even as agents, we must continue to improve, learn, and adapt.	1																					
116	115		301								Vonnegut	Much like the Dunning-Kruger Effect states, people will only step on the path to self-improvement once they realize their own shortcomings.	1																					
117	116		301									His words lack any sense of self-aggrandizing. He is like a modest teacher standing before the enemy. However, Chrome knows this modesty comes from the confidence of knowing that, no matter what happens, he can handle it with ease.																						
118	117		301									It is precisely because of his overwhelming power he is able to speak so freely about weakness and secrecy in front of his enemies.																						
119	118		301									If anything appears unnatural, it's that he keeps inadvertently glancing at Kamui's waist.																						
120	119		301								Chrome	...	2																					
121	120		301									Continuing to listen to Vonnegut's musings, Chrome turns his head slighty and glances at Kamui to figure out the cause of such an irregularity.																						
122	121		301									It appears that a buckle on Kamui's tactical belt had become loose during the previous ordeal.																						
123	122		301									...Is that it?																						
124	123		301								Chrome	...	2																					
125	124		301								Vonnegut	As an agent, I have long been searching for those worthy of building a better world with me.	1																					
126	125		301								Vonnegut	However, few are capable of passing the preliminary filtering. Even fewer are willing to go beyond that.	1																					
127	126		301								Vonnegut	Even though they are capable of becoming immune to the Punishing Virus, they lack the power needed to build a better tomorrow.	1																					
128	127		301									As Vonnegut speaks, he glances at Kamui's waist once more.																						
129	128		301									However, Chrome is able to catch the point of interest. His gaze does, in fact, fall upon the loose buckle.																						
130	129		301								Vonnegut	These people are nothing but fragile eggs to—	1																					
131	130		202							1	2				1																			
132	131		301									Although a bit untimely, Chrome politely interrupts Vonnegut to confirm who he is dealing with exactly.																						
133	132		201							1	500155																							
134	133		301							1	Chrome	Pardon me. Kamui.	1																					
135	134		202							1					1																			
136	135		301									Chrome turns around and fastens the loose buckle on Kamui's tactical belt.																						
137	136		201							1	1081001	1																						
138	137		301							1	Kamui	Huh? Why does that matter at a time like this?!	1

140	139		301							1	Wanshi	...	1																					
141	140		202							1					1																			
142	141		301									Seeing this, Vonnegut lets out a hearty laugh in satisfaction.																						
143	142		201							1	500305		450																					
144	143		201							2	500155		-450																					
145	144		301							1	Vonnegut	Hahaha! Either you have an eye for detail, or you're a perfectionist just like me.	1																					
146	145		301								Vonnegut	Seems Gabriel's intuition was right. I think you and I will get along swimmingly.	1																					
147	146		301								Vonnegut	As I was saying...	1																					
148	147		301									Vonnegut opens his arms to the trio cheerfully and looks them over.																						
149	148		301								Vonnegut	I hope you can also pass the filtering. Each splendid seed should be sowed on the road to tomorrow.	1																					
150	149		301								Chrome	I refuse.	2																					
151	150		301								Vonnegut	Your answer comes at no surprise, but tell me why.	1																					
152	151		301								Vonnegut	Perhaps, we don't need to fight each other. After all, everything I am doing is to provide a future for Earth.	1																					
153	152		301								Chrome	A future that only belongs to you?	2																					
154	153		301								Vonnegut	How do you define "you"?	1

156	155		201							1	1081001																							
157	156		301							1	Kamui	I'm obviously referring to the Ascendants and Corrupted.	1																					
158	157		202							1					1																			
159	158		201							1	500305		450																					
160	159		201							2	500155		-450																					
161	160		301							1	Vonnegut	Heh... Ascendants. Corrupted.	1																					
162	161		301								Vonnegut	Don't forget that we were once human. We were once Constructs.	1																					
163	162		301								Vonnegut	Even machines created by humanity have gained sentience. They have feelings and minds like us.	1																					
164	163		301								Vonnegut	For hundreds of millions of years, microscopic organisms, such as harmful bacteria and viruses, inhabited the Earth alongside animals.	1																					
165	164		301								Vonnegut	Prior to the Punishing Virus, how do you think life managed to survive infection and disease?	1																					
166	165		301								Chrome	...Evolution, or rather, the filtering?	2																					
167	166		301								Vonnegut	Correct. I assume you're their captain?	1																					
168	167		301								Vonnegut	Organisms that can resist disease give birth to offspring with higher immunity. Those that are weak, regardless of their time of birth, will only rot, thereby becoming nourishment for the land.	1																					
169	168		301								Vonnegut	During the filtering, organisms will gradually evolve. This is the order of the world.	1																					
170	169		301								Vonnegut	Now, the Corrupted have evolved into the Red Tide. The likes of which has turned into a breeding ground for new forms of life.	1																					
171	170		301								Vonnegut	The "dead" become nutrients for the creation of new "life." This is the will of the Punishing Virus. The Ascension-Network is no different.	1																					
172	171		301								Chrome	However, this "filtering" will come at the cost of most people.	2																					
173	172		301								Vonnegut	Life must be cruel only to be more beautiful.	1																					
174	173		301									Vonnegut smiles as he focuses his gaze on Chrome.																						
175	174		301								Vonnegut	It seems your Inver-Device is different from others. Interesting.	1																					
176	175		301								Vonnegut	Humans still manage occasional moments of brilliance in their struggle. But alas, this brilliance is too insignificant to assure victory.	1																					
177	176		301								Chrome	But even with the slightest ray of hope, we will await the day it expels darkness.	2																					
178	177		301								Vonnegut	Wait. Ah, yes. Wait.	1																					
179	178		301									Vonnegut places his hands behind his back and ruminates over the word.																						
180	179		301								Vonnegut	And if the Punishing Virus shows no signs of subsiding, you'll take solace in such frivolity as you wait.	1																					
181	180		301								Vonnegut	However, there is no such room for leisure now.	1																					
182	181		301								Chrome	Humanity will stop at nothing. The people you've deemed unfit continue to make changes.	2																					
183	182		301								Vonnegut	But I only see that they are complacent and stuck in the ways of the past.	1																					
184	183		301								Vonnegut	Not to mention, some have not given up killing each other in the name of science.	1																					
185	184		301								Vonnegut	How long can your persistence and stubbornness last in this struggle while still upholding these pedantic ideas?	1																					
186	185		202							1	2	3			1																			
187	186		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					He averts his gaze from the three faces and lowers his head in disappointment. In the dark waterway, the dusty lights begin to flash...
