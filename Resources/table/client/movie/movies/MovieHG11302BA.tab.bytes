4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Liv	Oh, Commandant. Good afternoon. Is something the matter?	1																					
5	5		302								Are you about to leave for military supplies?	6	Anything I can help with?	7																				
6	6	8	301								Liv	Oh‚Äîyup. Today's Thursday after all.	1																					
7	7		301								Liv	It's okay, Commandant. You should take a rest. I can handle the supplies.	1																					
8	8		302								Let me do it.	9																						
9	9		204							1	14																							
10	10		301								Liv	Huh...? But, that's part of my duties...	1																					
11	11		302								Get some rest, Liv.	12																						
12	12		301								Liv	W-was I messing it up before...? Did I do something wrong?	1																					
13	13		302								Of course not!	14																						
14	14		301									After an eternity, you finally convince Liv that you just want to help out, and that it is not an issue on her end.																						
15	15		301								Liv	...Then, I'll leave it to you, Commandant.	1																					
16	16		302								Leave this to me!	17																						
17	17		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	I don't know what drove you to do this, Commandant... But thanks!	1

20	20		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Learning from before, you pick up the military supplies without a hitch this time. You quickly scan the hall afterward.																						
21	21		301									...And you find her. Vera is in that same corner again, but this time, she seems to be conversing with a different person.																						
22	22		301									Vera's thin lips move. The man in front of her deflates visibly, just like the last. He hands her a... medication vial?																						
23	23		302								Wait!	24	(Stay still)	27																				
24	24		201							1	500168																							
25	25		301							1	Vera	...	1																					
26	26	33	301								Vera	...And here I was. Trying to pretend I didn't see you.	1																					
27	27		301									The man pauses and speaks something to Vera. She sighs.																						
28	28		201							1	500168																							
29	29		301							1	Vera	C'mere.	1																					
30	30		302								...	31																						
31	31		301								Vera	Hello? Do you need a new pair of ears?	1																					
32	32		302								Me?	33																						
33	33		301									Vera extends her hand and gestures, as if beckoning a small animal toward her. You are still unsure if she is referring to you, but you walk over anyway.																						
34	34		301									She then points at you, saying something inaudible to the man. The man nods and hands a black trunk to Vera.																						
35	35		301								Vera	...Yep, „Äêkuroname„Äë.	1																					
36	36		202							1																								
37	37		301									The man, likely some supplier, writes something down on a notebook.																						
38	38		302								(Peek)	39	(Try not to peek)	40																				
39	39	41	301									You see some nigh-unintelligible scribbles... and some unfamiliar words, and... your name...?																						
40	40		301									You tell yourself not to look, but you still accidentally catch several unfamiliar words on the pages.																						
41	41		301								Supplier	Alrighty.																						
42	42		301									Vera hums in delight. She grabs your arm before you could even react, then drags you outside.																						
43	43		302								What was that?	44	What's the matter?	44																				
44	44		201							1	500168	1																						
45	45		301							1	Vera	Nothing.	1																					
46	46		301								Vera	Just used your name for a little trade. That's all.	1																					
47	47		302								You used my name?	48	What trade?	52																				
48	48		301								Vera	Exactly what you think it is. Smuggling medical supplies. How's that sound? Want a piece, "pardner?"	1																					
49	49		302								That's illegal!	50	Really?	51																				
50	50	56	301								Vera	'Course I know it's illegal. Now that you're in on this, try saying no. You'll find yourself in the gutters in the morning.	1																					
51	51	56	301								Vera	Uh-huh. Now that you know. You only have one option left.	1																					
52	52		301								Vera	Just smuggling some medical supplies. Not much of a big deal. How's that sound? Want a piece, "pardner?"	1																					
53	53		302								No way!	54	You what?	55																				
54	54	56	301								Vera	Too late. We're already a couple of criminals.	1																					
55	55		301								Vera	Uh-huh. Now that you know. You only have one option left.	1																					
56	56		301								Vera	But, well. Thanks to your rep, the guy bowed down and agreed to a lower price.	1																					
57	57		301								Vera	Now that we're on the same boat though, I don't mind tellin' you a little something more.	1																					
58	58		302								Why are you doing this?	59	Why smuggle?	63																				
59	59		204							1	13																							
60	60		301								Vera	All the better to complete missions with, dear.	1																					
61	61		301								Vera	On the battlefield, I'm always the last one standing.	1																					
62	62	65	301								Vera	I don't expect the other mongrels to be at my level. So to stop them from dragging me down, I'll have to make preparations.	1																					
63	63		301								Vera	If I can just stroll into meds and grab these juicers, I won't be doing this.	1																					
64	64		301								Vera	What are you? Just naive? Or dumb?	1																					
65	65		302								So you're trafficking drugs?	66																						
66	66		204							1	1																							
67	67		301								Vera	No. Just messin' with you.	1																					
68	68		302								???	69	What are you actually doing?	69																				
69	69		204							1	13																							
70	70		301								Vera	Pah. Truth is, you're one annoying wimp. What I'm doing is none of your business.	1																					
71	71		301								Vera	Didn't I tell you to stop poking your nose into things?	1																					
72	72		301								Vera	And even so, you're still sniffing around my personal life. You might need a better whipping, "Commandant."	1																					
73	73		301								Vera	Go ahead, try bothering me again. But don't come crying because of what I'll do to you.	1																					
74	74		301									The red-haired vixen gloats at the expression you make.																						
75	75		301								Vera	What a face you pull! The Gray Ravens should get a picture of this and hang it over at their base.	1																					
76	76		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Vera	Anyways, what happened here, stays here. Cerberus has nothing to fear. You though, might want to watch out.	1
