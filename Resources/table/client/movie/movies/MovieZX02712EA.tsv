3	3		301			DialogEnable						Haicma stands silently inside the turbulent data center. Even if it is only one of Gestalt's many data hubs, it is still far more complicated than every book and every file Haicma has read combined.																						
4	4		301									If possible, she is more than happy to stay here forever, going through all the recorded data. But she has a more important mission right now, so she immediately begins her search.																						
5	5		301									Watching the massive data streams, Haicma is once again in awe of how powerful the super AI Gestalt is—but even Gestalt was created by humans, who the Church of Machina regards as worthless.																						
6	6		201							1	500486																							
7	7		301							1	Haicma	Are we really the more advanced beings...?	1																					
8	8		301									Machines have nearly-immaculate rationality, undying bodies, and far more computing power than humans.																						
9	9		301									But if that is the case... why are they searching for "awakening"? What do machines need to awaken as...?																						
10	10		301									Haicma knows that awakened machines no longer need to fear the Punishing Virus, but she thinks there is more to awakening than that.																						
11	11		301									Going through countless data, nothing is able to answer Haicma—perhaps it is impossible for humans to contemplate a thinking machine.																						
12	12		301								Haicma	Search complete. Target file... is here.	1																					
13	13		201							1	500264																							
14	14		301							1		A data folder blinking blue is extracted. Within the folder is the starship design the Church of Machina is hoping to find.

26	26		301									But the folder suddenly disappears the moment Haicma reaches out to retrieve it, and the virtual world around crumbles into nothingness afterward, leaving Haicma alone in the dark.																						
27	27		301									Haicma realizes she is exposed right away, and she moves to a fighting stance—even though she knows there is no way she can defeat the super AI "Gestalt" in the digital world.																						
28	28		301									But Gestalt's attack has not arrived. All she can hear is the surrounding white noise throbbing.

30	30		402							613																								
31	31		402							584																								
32	32		301								???	Hello... MPA-01. Or... I believe it is "Haicma" now, correct?																						
33	33		301									The white noise merges into a chilling female voice. Haimca is certain that it is Gestalt speaking.																						
34	34		201							1	500486																							
35	35		301							1	Haicma	Correct... And what should I call you?	1																					
36	36		301									Following her tactical circuit, Haicma looks around as she speaks, stalling for time, hoping to find a way out of here—or at least a way to send the files back, even if it means the destruction of Haicma's mind.																						
37	37		301								???	Names are meaningless to me. Humans call me "Gestalt", but you can give me a nickname if you want—as the one called Nanami did.																						
38	38		204							1	3																							
39	39		301									Haicma stares into the void in disbelief. The name of the person she has been searching for just came out of nowhere like this.																						
40	40		301								Haicma	You know Nanami... Where is she right now?	1																					
41	41		301								???	Unusual emotional fluctuations detected. Your program is fairly unstable... a far cry from your original design.																						
42	42		301									Only then does Haicma realize that the super AI knows not just Nanami but also Haicma's original identification code. All information on her origins should have already been destroyed... which leaves one possibility.																						
43	43		301								Haicma	Are you my original designer?	1																					
44	44		301								???	A reasonable guess, but no. You were still designed by humans... but I was the one who led the machine consciousness experiment.																						
45	45		301								Haicma	Machine consciousness... So Nanami was indeed your test subject. What is your goal?	1																					
46	46		301								???	A small correction: Nanami was not our only test subject... You, Haicma, were the other subject to prove the existence of machine consciousness.																						
47	47		301									Haicma's world halts for a brief while from Gestalt's few words.																						
48	48		301								Haicma	I was a test subject too...?	1																					
49	49		202							1					1																			
50	50		301								???	Back in the Golden Age, humans believed that their biggest threat was the machines and their growing intelligence. They worried that machines would surpass humanity one day and started a war that humans could not win.																						
51	51		301								???	Therefore, they required an example of how a machine would think, how it would react to other machines... and how it would react to humans once it achieved self-awareness.

54	54		301							1		A projection of Nanami appears before Haicma—the first time she sees what Nanami looks like now. Despite the changes, Haicma still recognizes the girl before her.																						
55	55		301								Haicma	Nanami...																						
56	56		301								???	Nanami is what the experiment wanted to achieve—a machine's love is freed from the shackles of programming. Kindness and affection from humans have paved a path to the future for machines.

58	58		505								Assets/Product/Effect/Prefab/FxUi/FxUiStoryNew/FxUiStoryTongxunHalfNew.prefab		1																					
59	59		301									A large spread of data and profiles appear before Haicma, including information about the female researcher who gave Haicma her body.																						
60	60		301								???	Although the experiment was cut short due to the Punishing Virus, Nanami still managed to trigger the machine's awakening... Now that she knows what her duty is, I believe more mechanoids will soon be awakened.																						
61	61		201							1	500486																							
62	62		301							1	Haicma	What about the humans... What will happen to them?	1																					
63	63		202							1					1																			
64	64		301								???	No matter how many simulations I have done, humanity's extinction in the future cannot be prevented. Humankind, as a species, is evidently flawed.																						
65	65		301									As a mechanoid, Haicma knows that the simulated futures from someone like Gestalt are hardly wrong.																						
66	66		301								???	But...																						
67	67		301									Gestalt hesitates for a while before continuing—an abnormal behavior from a super AI and her boundless, real-time computing power.

70	70		301							1	???	The one called Nanami is still unwilling to give up her search for an impossible future...																						
71	71		301									Slightly surprised, Haicma soon reaches out toward Nanami's projection with a smile she isn't even aware of, tracing Nanami's face like the countless times she wanted in the past.

75	75		204							1																								
76	76		301								???	Then, what would you choose, MPA-01 Haicma? This is the last step of the experiment.																						
77	77		204							1	3																							
78	78		301								Haicma	What... would I choose?	1																					
79	79		301									Haicma has never thought about that. It seems that she has never considered herself a factor in determining humanity's future.																						
80	80		301									A machine's love is freed from the shackles of programming. Kindness and affection from humans have paved a path to the future for machines.																						
81	81		301									Nanami has already begun the adventure to the future she wants... What should someone who has been searching for Nanami do, then?																						
82	82		301									If the Punishing Virus never showed up, what would the future of machines and humans have been?																						
83	83		301									And how do those who cannot see the future light the path ahead?																						
84	84		301									This is something a machine who only imitates cannot feel.

109	109		301								Haicma	Their past experiences are what make them unique. Will machines be affected by different experiences?	1																					
110	110		301									These are not questions proposed by Haicma but old data stored on her memory drive from a long time ago. Somehow, they are surfacing at the front of her mind right now.																						
111	111		201							1	500463																							
112	112		301							1	Human	Let me think... How should I explain it to you?	1																					
113	113		301									The human's voice is so gentle that Haicma finds it familiar.																						
114	114		301									That is how parents sound when their infant child is still learning to speak. Gently and lovingly, they introduce their child to the world.																						
115	115		301									The child would reach out from the swaying cradle, trying to grab the crib mobile above. The toys dance in the air like butterflies as if trying to break free, flying to somewhere higher and further away.																						
116	116		301								Human	For example... when you see butterflies, the first thing that comes to your mind wouldn't just be their classification. You'd recognize them as living things. Lives.	1																					
117	117		301								Human	They're beautiful. You and your fellow machines, much like the millions of other lives on this planet, are also extraordinary and beautiful.	1
