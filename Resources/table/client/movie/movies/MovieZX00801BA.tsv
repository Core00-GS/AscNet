9	6		301								Nikola	Gray Raven Commandant! Are you aware of the risks of your actions?	1																					
10	7		301								Nikola	In the name of the Babylonia Council, I'm ordering you to retreat, Gray Raven!	1																					
11	8		302								Sir, we're still in the middle of our mission...	9																						
12	9		301								Nikola	This is insubordination.	1																					
13	10		301								Nikola	Your actions have severely compromised the strategic safety of Babylonia.	1																					
14	11		301								Nikola	Your commanding authority will be suspended temporarily. I repeat. Withdraw immediately.	1

24	21		301								Nikola	President Hassen?	1																					
25	22		301								Hassen	If the Gray Ravens retreat, what are we going to do about Kamui?	2																					
26	23		301								Nikola	Just a defective Construct. It's not worth an entire elite squad for him.	1																					
27	24		301								Hassen	But he did display a possibility to fight against the Punishing Virus.	2																					
28	25		301								Nikola	That is only what his leader is saying. Even the Purifying Force has not given a concrete answer. This is too much to risk an elite squad for an uncertain return of this degree.	1																					
29	26		301								Hassen	You know, that sounds just like what an elite squad is for.	2																					
30	27		301								Nikola	President!	1																					
31	28		301								Hassen	Can't babysit them all your life, mom.	2																					
32	29		301								Nikola	Wha—?!	1																					
33	30		301								Hassen	Ah, just a joke, chill.	2																					
34	31		301								Hassen	Alright, loosen up a little. Trust them more, they know what they're doing.	2																					
35	32		301								Hassen	We'll need to assess Chrome's report as well.	2																					
36	33		301								Hassen	No time to chitchat around here now.	2																					
37	34		301								Hassen	Gray Raven squad, HQ will be airdropping you some supplies. The drop location will be sent to Liv through Celica. Retrieve them, then finish the mission quickly and return safely.	2

46	43		301								Liv	The airdrop will likely cause commotion and attract some Corrupted.	1																					
47	44		302								No time to lose.	45																						
48	45		301								Liv	Karen and Watanabe will be protected by the Forsaken and be repaired at their campsite. As for Karen's situation, she should be stable in the meantime with the sleep command.	1																					
49	46		301								Liv	We can wait until after the mission to bring Karen back to Babylonia for a full checkup.	1
