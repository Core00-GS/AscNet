14	12		301							1	Bianca	Commandant...	1																					
15	13		301								Bianca	I happen to be free today, so I arrived a little early.	1																					
16	14		301								Bianca	The temperature is still a little cold. Based on what you usually wear, you might be a bit underdressed.	1																					
17	15		301								Bianca	It's getting windy at night. Here, please put on this scarf in case you catch a cold...	1																					
18	16		302								Th-thank you...	17	That's very sweet of you, Bianca...	17																				
19	17		301								Bianca	It's what I should do.	1

25	23		301							1	Bianca	You haven't had your lunch yet, right, Commandant?	1																					
26	24		302								Not yet.	25	Now that you've mentioned it, I'm getting a little hungry.	25

30	28		301							1	Bianca	I wasn't sure what you liked, so I made one of every cuisine I was good at.	1																					
31	29		302								That's impressive!	30	Did you make all of this, Bianca?!	30																				
32	30		301								Bianca	(Nods)	1																					
33	31		301								Bianca	My previous... job involved taking care of other people.	1

41	38		301								Bianca	...Did I?	1																					
42	39		301								Bianca	I guess that's because this reminds me of the past.	1																					
43	40		301								Bianca	It has been a long time since someone said something like this to me...	1																					
44	41		301								Bianca	For some reason, it's oddly comforting.	1																					
45	42		302								It comforts you making food for other people?	43	Then please keep making food for me in the future!	43																				
46	43		301								Bianca	I-it's just... taking care of others has jogged some old memories.	1																					
47	44		301								Bianca	But if that's what you want, Commandant...	1
