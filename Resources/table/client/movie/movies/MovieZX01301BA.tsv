5	4		301									Yes, I know. How foolish it is, to imagine a friend for myself, isn't it?	1																					
6	5		301									But, foolish though I may be, I'm willing to believe that you are good, or at least, one that is trustworthy.	1																					
7	6		301									After all, you are my imagination. I can't betray myself, now, can't I?	1

10	9		301									I don't know if I can even live until tomorrow.																						
11	10		301									Anyway, it's foolish. Pure, distilled foolishness.																						
12	11		301									But still, please listen to what I have to say.																						
13	12		301									About the truth... and what we've just realized about this world.																						
14	13		301									About... things that might go poof—without a trace—after today. About things that might change what common sense means.																						
15	14		301									Before the real "battle" begins, a myriad of events will take place.																						
16	15		301									You do hear me, do you? You are not ignoring these seemingly meaningless words of mine, are you?

45	41		301								Celica	I am just reminding 【kuroname】 to rest.	1																					
46	42		301								Hassen	...Come to think of it. You've all been crammed with missions after missions.	2																					
47	43		301								Hassen	Even with your excellent performance, we might've been overworking you all.	2																					
48	44		301								Hassen	How about this, why don't I give you—no, you folks a vacation? Now that a few safe zones have been established on the surface, this should be doable.	2																					
49	45		301								Celica	In that case, can I join them? President, see, I've basically been working seven days a week for a while now...	1																					
50	46		301								Hassen	Here's the thing, I'd love to say yes, but...	2																					
51	47		301								Celica	Okay, what's the reason this time?	1																					
52	48		301								Hassen	I need someone to help me chair the reconstruction of Kowloong Metropolis, Wuming City, and K-44. And, we have to arrange local intelligence officers for infiltration recon of the Monastery of Purity...	2																					
53	49		301									Seeing Celica slowly rolling her eyes to Hassen's chatter, you feel a chuckle building up within you.																						
54	50		301								Hassen	...Anyhow, sorry, but please understand. If I get the chance to arrange a vacation for you, I will. Definitely.	2																					
55	51		301								Celica	...Overtime pay. Double.	1																					
56	52		301								Hassen	Deal.	2																					
57	53		301								Hassen	Okay. Back to the topic. Since it's a vacation, let's also get the other squads that came back from Kowloong.	2																					
58	54		302								Which means...	55																						
59	55		301								Hassen	Yep. Gray Raven, Strike Hawk, and the others that helped out.	2																					
60	56		301								Hassen	In that case, hmm, what to do with the location...	2																					
61	57		201							2	500012		400																					
62	58		301							1	Nikola	What are you talking about? Why are you all gathered around 【kuroname】?	2																					
63	59		301								Celica	President Hassen is suggesting that we send the returning squads from Kowloong to a safe zone for a vacation.	1																					
64	60		301								Nikola	In that case, I know a place.	2

69	66		301							1	Nikola	Caribbean Sea, Area D. It was a famous beach area until Operation Acadia.	1																					
70	67		301								Nikola	Now, plagued with not even a single tourist, it's a better-than-ever vacation spot.	1																					
71	68		201							1	500001																							
72	69		301							1	Celica	But we don't have that many forces stationed in that area...	1																					
73	70		201							1	500012																							
74	71		301							1	Nikola	That's because the viral density there is very low, and the garrisons there are just to keep an eye out.	1																					
75	72		301								Nikola	Besides, with the reconstruction teams working away in the other safe zones, our vacation-goers won't get any peace and quiet, yeah?	1

80	77		301							1	Celica	President?	1																					
81	78		301								Hassen	Area D should be a good choice. It used to be the center of some integration plan of the World Government.	2																					
82	79		301								Hassen	It had the best-of-the-best entertainment from before po-pan, all in this one place.	2																					
83	80		302								Sounds nice.	81	Looks like I don't have much of a choice.	81																				
84	81		301								Celica	Bottling it all up can mess with you. Gotta let your stress out from time to time.	1																					
85	82		301								Celica	Oh, how nice it must be. I also wanted to go to the beach with you guys...	1																					
86	83		301								Celica	It's not a common occasion. You should use it to get to know your teammates better.	1

98	93		301								Lucia	But Asimov and President Hassen told me that I'll have the time to do so.	1
