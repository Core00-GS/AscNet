4	4		304							The impact from the orbital strike has greatly reduced the coverage and concentration of the Red Tide.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1																			
5	5		304							But these losses are negligible because "that thing" has appeared deep beneath the scorched earth.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1																			
6	6		304							The impact of discovering such a thing is no less than the moment I found the Hetero-Core. At first, I didn't even fully comprehend what "that thing" was.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1																			
7	7		304							It's like a revelation, an affirmation of my long persistence.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1																			
8	4001		304							Although it shares the same characteristics as the Hetero-Creature incubators, it must be completely different inside. I call it the "Mother".	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1																			
9	8		304							It seems that "der Meister" is very interested in this new discovery. As one of the rewards for trading with him, I got a helpful assistant.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1																			
10	9		304							She has a keen knowledge of Hetero-Creatures and is an intelligent candidate for ascension.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1																			
11	10		304							Using her intellect, I found an incubation method to ensure that "Mother" can unleash its full power.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1																			
12	11		304							Cinderelik calls it "maternal love"—the protective instinct of human mothers toward their children. She then implanted this data into "Mother"...	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1																			
13	12		304							"Mother" has been an excellent incubator. It seems human emotions aren't completely useless. Maybe my previous directions were mistaken.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1		1																	
14	13		304							For this reason, I am simulating a special intervention to observe how "emotion" will affect "Mother" internally.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1																			
15	14		304							Unfortunately, I do not understand "emotions." The data provided by Cinderelik is too unitary. I need more human specimens.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1																			
16	15		304							—Intact low-risk human specimens must be introduced into the area where the test subject is located through non-combative means.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1																			
17	4002		304							This is no easy feat. Besides, the surrounding area has been scorched by the orbital strike. As a result, humans avoid the area out of fear.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1																			
18	16		304							I must admit, Roland is far more capable in this regard.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1																			
19	17		304							It's a pity that after the battle with the Polyphage, I lost contact with Roland. I presume he has already become nourishment for the Red Tide.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1																			
20	18		304							It seems that this experiment can only be carried out where the "Highly Differentiated Unit" is located.	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1																			
21	19		304							I released rumors to lure people to Pulia by taking advantage of humans' desire for gains. Just like how I spread the Red Tide's "Gospel".	ffffffff		Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory452.jpg		1

26	22		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Having made their way into the exposed ventilation duct, the Scavengers are crawling slowly inside the narrow and dark space.																						
27	23		301									After following Rolmo around and around for the umpteenth time, they finally find their way out of the ventilation duct.																						
28	24		301									Flickers of daylight shine through the dome. It's the only source of light inside this giant tower.																						
29	25		301									This magnificent facility, left behind since the time of the Great Evacuation, also falls victim to the ravages of nature.																						
30	26		301									Soft, moist grass covers the connecting passages. Vines and branches get all tangled up between the iron walls and staircases, opening the doors originally used to seal off the mysterious chambers and growing all the way up from the very bottom of the tower.																						
31	27		301									The Scavengers immediately see the boxes scattered across the bottom level. They bear the World Government icon.																						
32	28		201							1	500140																							
33	29		301							1	Beardy	Over there! Supply crates!	1																					
34	30		202							1	2				1																			
35	31		301									The stairs down were destroyed by overgrowth, so they have to cling to the edge and gradually climb down using the bare vines.																						
36	32		301									Right as "Beardy" is about to reach the bottom, the vine snaps under his weight, causing him to fall to the ground with a heavy thud.																						
37	33		301									The broken vine begins to writhe like a worm. Suddenly, the red plant rapidly regenerates from the severed vine. Convulsing momentarily, the green cuticle covers the entire branch again.																						
38	34		301									Compared with the branches of ordinary vines or plants, this weird twisted thing is more like the tentacle of a mollusk.																						
39	35		301									Beardy screams and dumps the plant in his hand. He quickly takes out the gun that has been hanging on the side of his bag.																						
40	36		201							1	500140

44	40		301							1	Kordes	Seems like the vine has mutated, just like the plants in the forest.	2																					
45	41		301								Kordes	If their suspicions are correct, destroying it will only increase the Punishing concentration, just like those monsters.	2																					
46	42		301								Beardy	First Corrupted, now... I've had enough.	1

53	49		301								Zack	Are there any of the monsters we saw in the tower, too?	1																					
54	50		301								Rolmo	I... I don't know...	2																					
55	51		301								Zack	If I find out you're lying...	1

58	54		301							1	Beardy	Shush—	1																					
59	55		301									"Beardy", who was already leading the way over to the supply crate, suddenly turns around and gestures to be silent.																						
60	56		301								"Beardy"	Quiet. Looks like we're not alone here.	1																					
61	57		301									"Beardy" walks around the pile of supply crates and discovers a person quietly sitting in the corner behind the crates.																						
62	58		301									Or rather, it wasn't a "person."																						
63	59		201							1	500139																							
64	60		301							1	Kordes	...It's dead.	1																					
65	61		301									The corpse is leaned up against an empty supply crate. Its skull had been pierced by a branch, and its mouth hangs motionlessly agape.																						
66	62		301									Its decayed hands were in an empty grip, as if they were holding something tightly before they died. Scarlet plant branches entwine around its body, almost assimilating it with the surrounding environment.																						
67	63		301									The group falls silent at the horrific sight. "Beardy" curses, then walks up to the body.																						
68	64		301								Kordes	Hey! Watch out for the plants!	1																					
69	65		201							1	500140																							
70	66		301							1		Beardy replies. He keeps a distance and pokes the corpse as well as the plants around it with his gun, then backs off quickly.																						
71	67		301								Beardy	It's okay. It's not moving.	1																					
72	68		301									Confirming that the plants won't ambush them, "Beardy" kneels down next to the corpse and expertly pats it down, looking for anything useful.																						
73	69		301									Not finding anything, "Beardy" turns over the backpack that fell to the side, then shakes his head and throws it back.																						
74	70		301									The unidentifiable corpse has nothing that can be deemed "useful."																						
75	71		301								"Beardy"	Nothing. Looks like there've been at least three other groups that came here before us.	1																					
76	72		301									He points at the bullet marks on the supply crates and grins.																						
77	73		301								Beardy	I see three different kinds of bullet holes, new and old. Looks like there was a firefight here. This unlucky bastard didn't make it out.	1																					
78	74		301								"Beardy"	Check the area. See if we can turn up anything useful. We can't go home empty-handed.	1																					
79	75		301									The other three nod. Readying their weapons, they spread out in opposite directions without having to say another word.																						
80	76		201							1	500139																							
81	77		301							1	Kordes	...Huh. A book.	1																					
82	78		301									Kordes stops in front of an unlucky corpse. He bends down to pick up a book that appears to have fallen out of his hand. He carefully turns the crisp paper. The sallow pages are stained with oxidized blood.																						
83	79		301								Kordes	Looks like a religious text...	1																					
84	80		301								Kordes	The Story of Genesis, Eden, the Tree of Life—	1																					
85	81		203							1	0.25	-400																						
86	82		201							2	500140		400																					
87	83		301							1	Beardy	Why are you always so obsessed with weird stuff?	2																					
88	84		201							2	500136		400																					
89	85		301							1	Zack	Take only the things that are really useful, Kordes. Don't forget our rules.	2																					
90	86		301								Kordes	...I know.	1																					
91	87		301								Kordes	This area's clear. I didn't find anything. How about you guys?	1

93	89		201							1	500140																							
94	90		301							1	"Beardy"	I found two boxes of military rations and one box of pistol ammo. Looks like they belonged to the ground troops. They were hidden out of sight. I almost missed them.	2																					
95	91		301								Beardy	Zack, see something?	1																					
96	92		301									Zack remains quiet. He doesn't appear to hear what "Beardy" had said. He just stares at a spot on the tower.																						
97	93		301								"Beardy"	Zack? You okay? See something?	1																					
98	94		301									Only until "Beardy" walks up to him and pats him does he slowly turn his head. His face contorts into a strange expression as he points to the area he had been observing.																						
99	95		301									That's the ventilation facility at the bottom of the tower, which hasn't been damaged by branches and vines yet. The tangled-up vines find their way around the fan blades on all the vents.																						
100	96		301									A gust of wind is coming from the depths of the vents, and along with it comes the noise of some large operating Mechanoid. The sound is a rhythmic beat, reminiscent of a heartbeat.																						
101	97		201							1	500136																							
102	98		301							1	Zack	If I'm not mistaken...	1																					
103	99		301								Zack	It's barely noticeable, but... 	1																					
104	100		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Zack	I think the tower... is still in operation.	1
