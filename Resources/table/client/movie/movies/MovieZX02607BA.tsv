3	3		301			DialogEnable						Nanami has never seen a battlefield like this.																						
4	4		301									The ground is charred black under the moonlight. The smell of sulfur spreads in the air as fires slowly burn in the ruins.																						
5	5		301									Dead bodies of humans, Constructs, and mechanoids remain tangled in a fight. Broken mechanoids speak with their stammering voices, "Free will for machines."																						
6	6		301									But no one here is alive. There is no sign of life.

10	10		301									This is obviously not one of the possible futures Nanami has imagined.																						
11	11		301									She walks speedily among the ruins, scanning every possibly useful data. Searching for a weak signal she detected, she begins to get the lay of the land.																						
12	12		301									All structures in this area look twisted. They are built with large, uniform pyramids, and they all look odd and cold without a hint of humanity.																						
13	13		301									As she analyzes, she finds the frontline on this battlefield retreating. Scales of engagements also seem to be reducing.																						
14	14		301								Nanami	Message deciphered... Fort Niflheim?	1

22	22		202							1					1																			
23	23		301									Nanami looks up to see fully armed Constructs lying on a roof high above. Hearing their shouts, Nanami does not have time to rejoice before she is shot down from Power.																						
24	24		201							1	500472	4																						
25	25		301							1	Nanami	Why...	1																					
26	26		301									Looking at the scratches on her chest, Nanami feels a twisted pain in her head. Humans' bullets have never caused her any real harm, but the realistic impacts and the dissonant scene are giving her a headache.

44	44		401							2	915

76	76		401							2	561																							
77	77		301									The ground below her begins to shake and crumple, revealing a pit designed to trap large mechanoids. Power accidentally takes a wrong step and tips, now stuck.																						
78	78		301								Nanami	No... This time, Nanami will be different...	1																					
79	79		301									Clenching her teeth, Nanami walks forward on the collapsed ground, struggling to inform the other party she is a friend.

85	85		301									Unexpectedly, a hand drags her away.																						
86	86		301									That person seems to have descended from heaven, breezing through the difficult terrain and dodging the gunshots, bringing Nanami behind her slanted mech. A missile brushes past the mech's armor, exploding mid-air.																						
87	87		301									Speaking with a calm voice, that person opens his or her cloak to block the blinding searchlight from the fort, the person's face hidden in the hood.

91	91		401							2	662																							
92	92		301								???	I'll explain later. In 10 seconds, the humans will empty their weapons and reload, which takes about 30 seconds. Please take this opportunity to escape.	2																					
93	93		401							2	662																							
94	94		301									The mechanoid repeats her suggestion, carrying Nanami to Power's cockpit before jumping down the trap and lifting Power's leg, letting it regain balance.																						
95	95		301								???	8 seconds. This mech should be fast enough. Please make use of it.	2																					
96	96		301								Nanami	Huh...? H-hold on! Nanami is not leaving! Nanami is asking them why they're hurting Nanami! I won't be shot at for no reason! Maybe they thought Power was going to attack them...	1																					
97	97		301								???	5 seconds. They're not afraid because of the weapon you're piloting. They're afraid because we are machines.	2																					
98	98		301									The suppressive fire starts to diminish as Constructs in charge of close-range battles depart the fort, blades in hand. Facing an "enemy" unscathed by bullets, the soldiers are ardent to kill her in one last stand.																						
99	99		301								???	If you don't leave now, you will only cause more deaths.	2
