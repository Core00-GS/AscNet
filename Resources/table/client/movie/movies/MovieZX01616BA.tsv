8	8		302								Let's sort out all the key information first.	9																						
9	9		301								Liv	Alright, I've laid out all the known information regarding Ascendants and Huaxu. I can use this database to screen for useful intel.	1																					
10	10		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lucia	Looks like this is quite the workload. Let's divvy it up.	2

18	18		302								What about Liv?	19																						
19	19		301								Liv	I didn't find any useful clues matching the keywords, but I came across a letter... A farewell letter, rather.	1																					
20	20		301								Lucia	A farewell letter?	2																					
21	21		301								Liv	Well, a torn farewell letter. It's only the first half of the page. I was able to find it because it contains the word "Huaxu".	1																					
22	22		302								Huaxu?	23																						
23	23		301								Liv	Correct. It says: "I found a way to fight the Punishing Virus. I wanted to use it to create the legendary Huaxu Utopia. But it has cost all of my possessions, and it appears that I will die before its completion..."	1																					
24	24		301								Liv	"If you are reading this letter, please look for it at the location below..."	1																					
25	25		301								Liv	The last part is missing.	1																					
26	26		301								Lucia	A method to fight the Punishing Virus?	2																					
27	27		301								Lee	It's probably either a ruse or just nonsense.	3																					
28	28		301								Lucia	You're right. We can't confirm it without the last part. But maybe we shouldn't completely ignore it.	2																					
29	29		302								Let's look for the last part of the letter.	30																						
30	30		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	Alright. We'll keep an eye out. Let's keep going, Commandant.	1
