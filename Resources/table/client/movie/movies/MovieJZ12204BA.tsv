6	6		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The moment Lloyd regains consciousness, he hears a voice. But before he can tell who is speaking, a sharp pain swarms all over his M.I.N.D., forcing him to open his eyes.

8	8		301							1	Lloyd	Gargh... Argh...	1																					
9	9		301									Lloyd gasps and struggles. He finally finds out the source of his agony—there is a large wound on his arm, seemingly caused by something sharp.																						
10	10		201							1	500343																							
11	11		301							1	???	Shut up... If you can feel the pain, that means you are not dead.	1																					
12	12		301									Lloyd finds Vera standing next to the hospital bed, adjusting the machine with an annoyed look.																						
13	13		201							1	500348																							
14	14		301							1	Lloyd	Miss Vera... Why are you here?	1

16	16		201							2	500168		400																					
17	17		301							1	Vera	I only came here because Nikola wanted me to check whether you were alive or dead. Well, it looks like you get to live a little longer.	2																					
18	18		301								Vera	But your followers weren't so lucky.	2																					
19	19		301									Lloyd remembers that he was on a mission with a few other Constructs who took direct orders from Nikola. They encountered an exceptionally powerful Corrupted with wings. The other soldiers chose to stay back so Lloyd could retreat...																						
20	20		204							1	6																							
21	21		301								Lloyd	What... happened to them?!	1																					
22	22		301									Vera looks away impatiently without a word, but he already knows the answer.																						
23	23		301								Lloyd	Why... why would they do it for someone like me...	1

26	26		301							1	Vera	Someone like you...? Hah...	2																					
27	27		301									Vera gives a sarcastic laugh, grabbing Lloyd's collar to pick him up so he can look directly into her eyes.																						
28	28		204							2																								
29	29		301								Vera	I don't care if you like playing the hero game. I've no right to criticize you. But...	2																					
30	30		204							2																								
31	31		301									Lloyd notices an extremely fierce look in Vera's eyes. He has never seen her so furious.																						
32	32		301								Vera	They gave their lives to protect you. In other words, they placed your life above theirs. Are you going to insult their dedication?	2																					
33	33		301								Vera	Get yourself together and remember your duty. "The Undying Loy" and that so-called recall should become the soldiers' final hope.	2																					
34	34		301									Vera keeps her voice low, but it still weighs heavily on Lloyd's mind.																						
35	35		301								Vera	But... do you really want to be a hero?	2																					
36	36		301									Vera thinks Lloyd neither has the capabilities to be a hero nor is he prepared to become one. He is nothing but a good kid who has gotten carried away with his sense of duty. Once he truly understands the brutality of the battlefield, his naivety will be lost.

39	39		301							1	Lloyd	I...	1																					
40	40		301									Lloyd takes out a notebook, which Vera has seen before during their mission. It records everything that the "Lloyd" in the past has been through.

45	45		301								Lloyd	I have never thought about it... but perhaps you're right. I lack the strength to be a hero, and I'm not prepared to become one either... I am only playing "Lloyd" according to the stories in this notebook.	1																					
46	46		204							1	1																							
47	47		301								Lloyd	Miss Vera... I once thought that if I could act well enough, maybe I could become a real hero in the end.	1																					
48	48		301									Lloyd shakes his head and gives a wry smile.																						
49	49		204							1	4																							
50	50		301								Lloyd	But just like you said, I am not a hero. And I probably will never be one... The lies pile on every day, and they've brought me nothing but pain. What should I do...?	1																					
51	51		203							1	0.25	-400																						
52	52		201							2	500168		400																					
53	53		301							1	Vera	This pain will stay forever if you don't have the strength to be a real hero or tell the truth. But if you can't even stand the pain...	2																					
54	54		301									Vera stands up and unsheathes her blade, pointing it at Lloyd.																						
55	55		204							2	13																							
56	56		301								Vera	Then you should just die. Die like a coward, and leave all your responsibilities to the next "Lloyd".	2																					
57	57		204							2																								
58	58		301									The blade is sharp, but Lloyd does not seem to cower at all.																						
59	59		204							1	4																							
60	60		301								Lloyd	Miss Vera... Will the next "Lloyd" be a better hero than me?	1																					
61	61		301								Vera	Maybe, but you won't need to know, because you will be dead by then. The future has nothing to do with you.	2																					
62	62		301								Vera	The only thing you can hold on to... is this moment, and who you are right now.	2																					
63	63		301									Lloyd clenches Vera's blade. Vital fluid immediately runs out of his palm, dripping onto his notebook and dyeing the empty spots blood red.																						
64	64		204							1	6																							
65	65		301								Lloyd	It hurts... but...	1																					
66	66		301									The excruciating pain is more vivid than the wound on his arm left by the Corrupted. The tighter he grips the blade, the more intense the pain gets.																						
67	67		204							1	4																							
68	68		301								Lloyd	Right now, I still want to become "Lloyd"—a true hero.	1																					
69	69		301								Lloyd	Maybe my story began with a lie, and it will end in one. Still, I want to try again... to fight as "Lloyd".	1																					
70	70		301									Lloyd lets go of Vera's blade and clenches his fist again, feeling the sting.																						
71	71		204							1	4																							
72	72		301								Lloyd	Miss Vera... I hope you can give me extra combat training after the next mission. I want to have the confidence and strength to face danger like you.	1																					
73	73		301									Vera puts her katana back to the sheath with a teasing grin.																						
74	74		204							2	13																							
75	75		301								Vera	What if I say no...?	2																					
76	76		301								Lloyd	In that case... I'll try to ask Commander Nikola.	1																					
77	77		204							2	1																							
78	78		301									Seeing Lloyd's serious face, Vera's smile softens.

81	81		301								Vera	Not bad. You aren't as stupid as I thought... Do as you like, but...	2																					
82	82		301								Vera	I bet you are going to regret it. Do you really want to be like me? I am the direct opposite of a "hero."	2																					
83	83		202							1	2				1																			
84	84		301									Vera looks at Lloyd before walking away with a chuckle.																						
85	85		301									Lloyd shakes his head as he watches Vera leave. He runs his fingers past the cover of the notebook.
