3	3		301			DialogEnable						Some time has passed since the Gray Raven escorted Ruolin back.

5	6		301							1	Bridget	You came at the right time.	1																					
6	7		302								At the right time, again?	8																						
7	8		301									She looks the same as always, but there is something about her that betrays her composure.																						
8	9		301								Bridget	It's urgent, and let me bring you up to speed in 15 seconds. Remember Ruolin from before?	1																					
9	10		302								I do.	11																						
10	11		301								Bridget	She's been assigned to a different group. She has a good attitude, but is having a hard time fitting in and working with the team for fights. She seems absent-minded all the time.	1																					
11	12		302								She needs a rest.	13																						
12	13		301								Bridget	The body can recover with rest, but it's going to take the heart a lot longer to do the same.	1																					
13	14		301								Bridget	So the higher-ups have suggested that she have this part of her memory deleted, because it's having too strong an influence on her.	1																					
14	15		302								Only this part?	16																						
15	16		301								Bridget	They said if they had Asimov do it, he could accurately conceal certain parts of her memory.	1

18	19		201							1	500167	4																						
19	20		301							1	Bridget	The negotiation went well. They went over her compensation and even had her signature already.	1																					
20	21		301								Bridget	But she bailed at the last moment and came back here.	1																					
21	22		301									She points at the e-mail on the projection screen. It seems like she's only just received the news.																						
22	23		302								Should I go and help look for her?	24																						
23	24		301								Bridget	You've already helped me once, so I find it easier to just ask you.	1																					
24	25		302								Ok.	26																						
25	26		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Bridget	These are her coordinates. She seems to be around the Red Tide. I have your protective equipment ready for you. Go as soon as you can.	1

29	30		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Following Ruolin's coordinates, the Gray Raven heads straight into the Red Tide on Bridget's reinforced speedboat.																						
30	31		301								Liv	The target is standing on the slab in the middle of the Red Tide! She appears severely infected and is about to max out!																						
31	32		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					With your monitoring goggles, you can see Ruolin standing on an elevated slab of rock in the middle of the Red Tide. She is looking at the blood-red water, in which a red projection floats.																						
32	33		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/Bgstory289.png																								
33	34		302			AniZhuanchangEnd					...A Red Tide projection!	35																						
34	35		301								Lucia	Speed up!																						
35	36		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Red Tide Projection	......																						
36	37		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgCg/Cg1601_7.jpg																								
37	38		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						The Gray Raven heads for Ruolin at full speed. Ruolin walks toward the edge of the slab after speaking with the Red Tide, her expression now free of worries.																						
38	40		302								Ruolin! Come back!	41																						
39	41		301									She hears you calling for her at the top of your voices, and she smiles as she turns to face this way.																						
40	42		301								Ruolin	......																						
41	43		301									Ruolin seems to have said something, yet what she said is drowned out by the splashing waves.																						
42	44		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					A red ocean apart, she waves at the speedboat that's speeding toward her. Then, she takes a leap forward...

45	47		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1	Bridget	I see...	1																					
46	48		301								Bridget	She worked for me before she joined the Task Force. She wasn't outstanding at all, but worked hard and never crossed the line.	1																					
47	49		302								...	51																						
48	50		204							1	4																							
49	51		301								Bridget	Cheer up already.	1																					
50	52		301									Bridget's comforting tone is anything but comforting. She forces a smile as she points at the footage from the monitoring goggles.																						
51	53		301								Bridget	Look at her mouth.	1																					
52	54		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Bridget	She's saying, "Thank you"...	1
