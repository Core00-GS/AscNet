4	4		301							1	Duelist Construct	I send Musashi V from my hand to the graveyard, activating its effect: Choose 1 Musashi card from your deck and place it into your hand.	1																					
5	5		301								Duelist Construct	And since I drew a Musashi card outside of my draw phase, I get to special summon Musashi Zero from my hand.	1																					
6	6		301								Duelist Construct	Once a Musashi Zero has been special summoned, I get to special summon another Musashi card from my hand.	1

9	9		301							1	Rosetta	You're summoning two monsters at once...?!	2																					
10	10		301								Duelist Construct	And the one I'm summoning is, of course, the one I added to my hand thanks to Musashi V—Musashi IX!	1

12	12		201							1	500043																							
13	13		301							1	Spectator A	Ooooh! He now has over 6,000 total monster damage! With no monsters on the field, Rosetta can't withstand the attack!	1

17	17		301							1	Rosetta	Hmph, don't underestimate me. I activate my quick-attack card—Sky Striker Anchor!	2																					
18	18		301							1	Duelist Construct	N-nani?!	1																					
19	19		204							2	4																							
20	20		301								Rosetta	Sky Striker Anchor allows me to gain control of one monster on your field until the end of my turn. Which, of course, means your Musashi IX is mine!	2

22	22		201							2	500042		400																					
23	23		301							1	Spectator A	Oh, no! She took Musashi IX...?! It not only has an absurd attack of 3,100, it also can't be destroyed through combat!	1																					
24	24		301							1	Spectator B	Is Rosetta going to live through this round?	2

33	33		301							1	Duelist Construct	I activate my trap card, Musashi Whirlwind!	1																					
34	34		301								Duelist Construct	This card allows me to return any Musashi card on the battlefield to its owner's deck, and we each draw one card.	1																					
35	35		301							1	Rosetta	I get to draw one, too?	2																					
36	36		301								Duelist Construct	Of course, but the card must also be revealed to all players! If it's a monster card, it can be directly summoned onto the battlefield!	1

38	38		201							2	500042		400																					
39	39		301							1	Spectator A	Wait, but if Rosetta draws a monster card, then she might...	1																					
40	40		301							1	Spectator B	No... With Rosetta's luck, she won't.	2																					
41	41		301								Spectator A	Is that how it works?!	1																					
42	42		202							1	2																							
43	43		301									On your way back to the Gray Raven's quarters, you hear fervent cheers coming from the engineering bay.																						
44	44		301									You decide to check out what all the fuss is about. As you enter the engineering bay, you see Rosetta and a Construct playing a card game.

48	48		301							1	Rosetta	...	2																					
49	49		301									From the looks of it, this round will likely be the final one, with this card draw deciding the players' fate.																						
50	50		301									Under the rambunctious cheering of less than ten spectators, the players place their hands on their decks.

55	55		301								Duelist Construct	Looks like Lady Luck is smiling upon me. I have drawn a monster card... Come forth, bearing the blade in your heart—Musashi IX!	1

59	59		301							1	Spectator A	I see! That must be why you slot three Musashi IXs into your deck!	1																					
60	60		301							1	Spectator B	Um... I don't think that has anything to do with it.	2																					
61	61		202							1	2																							
62	62		301									Now clearly at a disadvantage, Rosetta's opponent and the crowd await her card draw in eager anticipation.																						
63	63		201							1	500214																							
64	64		301							1	Rosetta	...It'd be nice if it were a monster card, but...	1																					
65	65		202							1																								
66	66		301									Rosetta reveals the card she drew as a magic card. Her opponent leaps joyously into the air, and she lets out a sigh.																						
67	67		201							1	500214	8																						
68	68		301							1	Rosetta	It really isn't my lucky day.	1																					
69	69		302								Is the match over?	70	I didn't know you liked card games.	72																				
70	70		204							1																								
71	71	74	301								Rosetta	Yeah, I lost. Looks like I'm no good at luck-based games.	1																					
72	72		301								Rosetta	I guess I do, but I always lose.	1																					
73	73		204							1																								
74	74		301								Rosetta	Anyway... What brings you here, Commandant? Do you need something from the engineering bay?	1																					
75	75		302								I came to see what the fuss was about.	76	What are you doing here instead?	77																				
76	76	78	301								Rosetta	I see... Looks like we got carried away.	1																					
77	77		301								Rosetta	Well, as you can see, I'm playing a card game. Before that, I was here for routine maintenance.	1																					
78	78		201							1	500019																							
79	79		301							1	Duelist Construct	Enough with the chit-chat, Rosetta. I'm sure you know what losing means!	1																					
80	80		201							1	500214	4																						
81	81		301								Rosetta	Yeah, I do... I'll be surveying the Arctic in your stead.	1																					
82	82		302								You were deciding this over a duel?!	83																						
83	83		201							1	500019																							
84	84		301							1	Duelist Construct	It's a nonessential mission, and there's no time limit—that's why... Chill your beans, Gray Raven Commandant.	1																					
85	85		301								Duelist Construct	I'll send the mission details to your dedicated channel later. Rosetta, go register with our chief first.	1																					
86	86		201							1	500214																							
87	87		301								Rosetta	Uhm... But this mission requires at least two people...	1																					
88	88		204							1	4																							
89	89		301								Rosetta	Will you go with me, Commandant? I know it's a bit out of the blue.	1																					
90	90		302								If it doesn't take too long, then sure.	91	Okay.	92																				
91	91	94	301								Rosetta	It shouldn't. The engineering staff said it's not high on the list of priorities.	1																					
92	92		204							1	1																							
93	93		301								Rosetta	Thank you.	1																					
94	94		201							1	500019																							
95	95		301							1	Duelist Construct	Got your team sorted? Just tell the chief Rosetta and the Gray Raven Commandant will be surveying the Arctic.	1																					
96	96		301								Duelist Construct	...Hahahaha. With that mission sorted, I can spend time on assembling my hyper laser cannon instead!	1
