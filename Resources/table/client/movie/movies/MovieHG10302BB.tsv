4	4		301			DialogEnable				1	Liv	I'll do my best to complete the special training, Commandant!	1																					
5	5		302								What exactly are we doing?	6	I'll also do my best to help you.	6																				
6	6		301								Liv	I've compiled several training programs after analyzing the data... but there's something I want to ask you first, Commandant.	1																					
7	7		302								Sure.	8	Why don't we just do what the programs say?	9																				
8	8	10	301								Liv	Wonderful! I knew you'd help me, Commandant.	1																					
9	9		301								Liv	It'll take quite a long time if we do all of them, so I thought it's best if you decide which one we should do, Commandant.	1																					
10	10		301								Liv	I'm uncertain about what criteria we should be using to select our training program. Commandant, what kind of Construct is the most helpful to you?	1																					
11	11		302								As long as they're helpful in combat.	12	Constructs that are helpful outside combat as well.	13																				
12	12	14	301								Liv	Combat is of course our top priority, isn't it?	1																					
13	13		301								Liv	Outside combat? Like being able to handle other duties?	1																					
14	14		301								Liv	Another question, then. What kind of personality do you think is good for a Construct?	1																					
15	15		301								Liv	For example, whose personality would you prefer: Lucia or Nanami?	1																					
16	16		302								They're on two ends of a spectrum, aren't they?	17	I don't know how to answer that out of the blue.	18																				
17	17	19	301								Liv	Two ends, are they... but I can't think of a better pair to compare...	1																					
18	18		301								Liv	I'm sorry, Commandant! Did that question make you uncomfortable?	1																					
19	19		301								Liv	Then... my last question, Commandant... Do you...	1																					
20	20		301								Liv	Do you...	1																					
21	21		302								What is it?	22	Yes?	22																				
22	22		301								Liv	No, forget it.	1																					
23	23		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	Anyway, I understand what you're looking for in a Construct now, Commandant. I'll compile the data and present you with a new training program!	1
