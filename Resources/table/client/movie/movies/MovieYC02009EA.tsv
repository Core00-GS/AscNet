5	5		301								Voodoo	"Loki" has already done so.	1																					
6	6		301								Voodoo	But, from the look of it, you don't seem to be worthy.	1																					
7	7		301								Voodoo	So, let's end it here.	1																					
8	8		301									The lights on Voodoo's mask begin to flash and change colors. Roland clenches his weapons.																						
9	9		301								Voodoo	If... you... can... surive...	1																					
10	10		301								Voodoo	I... will... judge... again...	1																					
11	11		301								Voodoo?	Heehee... Heehahaahaa... Hahahahaha!	1																					
12	12		301									Voodoo's calm voice becomes twisted, changing into a horrifying scream once again.																						
13	13		301								Voodoo?	Worst case, I'll just tear you apart and throw your remains to Mister! He won't care! Weaklings don't deserve to live!	1																					
14	14		301									After a round of battle, Roland is already getting used to her bipolar characteristics.																						
15	15		201							1	500334	2																						
16	16		301							1	Roland	Worst case? Are you suggesting that... I can still live to see your "Mister"?	1																					
17	17		201							1	500327																							
18	18		301							1	Voodoo?	...	1																					
19	19		301			PanelActor1Shake					Voodoo?	Dammit... What the... Did those words trigger the defense mechanism...?	1																					
20	20		301								Voodoo?	Ugh... Ahh...	1																					
21	21		201							1	500334																							
22	22		301							1	Roland	?	1																					
23	23		201							1	500327																							
24	24		301							1	Voodoo	"Loki" has gone haywire, exceeding the prediction. The components of the simulation constraint in her vital fluid need to be readjusted...	1																					
25	25		301								Voodoo	...But the mission must go on.	1																					
26	26		301								Voodoo	Individual "Roland", my mission is to test you.	1																					
27	27		301								Voodoo	But I'm not seeing anything worth noting in your performance. Your battle stats are lower than the benchmarks set by Mister.	1																					
28	28		301								Voodoo	Neither have you displayed the intelligence—like Mister said—that could neglect the difference in strength.	1																					
29	29		201							1	500334	2																						
30	30		301							1	Roland	...You've done a lot of homework.	1																					
31	31		201							1	500327																							
32	32		301							1	Voodoo	Mister knows everything.	1																					
33	33		301			PanelActor1Shake					Voodoo	So, I'm... not... going...	1																					
34	34		301			PanelActor1Shake				1		Starting from her hand, Voodoo's entire body begins to tremble. The light spots on her keep changing colors.																						
35	35		301								Voodoo	"Lo"... You... betrayer...	1																					
36	36		301			PanelActor1Shake					Voodoo	B-b-betray... ER...	1																					
37	37		301								Voodoo?	...So what?! Are you going to... execute yourself? Do you still think you can separate yourself from me... ever since you put your favorite movie character in your brain?	1																					
38	38		301								Voodoo?	"Voodoo", no... Researcher RIKD-042... You don't seem to understand our relationship, do you?	1																					
39	39		201							1	500334	2																						
40	40		301							1	Roland	Tsk... You can argue all the time you want, but can I go?	1																					
41	41		201							1	500327																							
42	42		301							1	Voodoo?	...	1																					
43	43		401							2	1509																							
44	44		301									Voodoo is not responding, but the missile launcher on her back locks onto Roland again.																						
45	45		301								Voodoo?	...WHAT DO YOU THINK?	1																					
46	46		301								Voodoo?	What shall I take? Your entire body, or a hand, or your head? Which one will make Mister happier?	1

62	62		301			RImgBg1Shake				1		Time after time, Voodoo uses her wings and missiles to outmatch Roland's chain blade.																						
63	63		301									Roland seems to be cornered. He can only swing his chain blade to repulse another attack from Voodoo.

67	67		301			PanelActor2Shake						But once he gets enough distance to fire, he immediately shoots the last eight slugs at Voodoo's helmet.																						
68	68		401							2	1509																							
69	69		301									Voodoo's head flinches backward. She tumbles in mid-air, until the auto-balancing device in her suit controls the engine to adjust her position.																						
70	70		202							1	2				1																			
71	71		301									—She barely manages to maintain balance before falling to the ground.

73	73		301							1	Voodoo?	So painful... It hurts...	1																					
74	74		301								Voodoo?	Heehahaha... Hahahahaha!! **** you! It hurts so bad!	1																					
75	75		301								Voodoo?	You hit me! I'm going to kill you! I'm going to tear you apart! I'm going to rip your insides out and rub them on your face!	1																					
76	76		301									In contrast, Roland makes a firm landing. He pretends to pat dust off himself, even though there is no dust on him. His opponent is blocked by the trees.																						
77	77		201							1	500334	2																						
78	78		301							1	Roland	Oh, c'mon... You spent all these efforts to lure me here just to beat me up?	1																					
79	79		301									He sounds relaxed, but soon taunts again.																						
80	80		301								Roland	We could have sat down and chatted if you had any complaints. Resorting to violence is not how a gentleman like me would have preferred...	1																					
81	81		301									He continues to humiliate his opponent... which is no longer needed. Voodoo has already risen to the sky and dives again.																						
82	82		201							1	500327																							
83	83		301							1	Voodoo?	Enough with your bullshit! I've no idea what the mission is! I just want you dead!	1

100	100		301							1	Roland	...	1																					
101	101		301									For one split second, Voodoo thought she saw a grin in Roland's eyes. But it disappeared so soon that she felt it was just an illusion.																						
102	102		301								Roland	Tsk, doesn't even care about the mission now? Why would they send a psychopath...	1																					
103	103		301									Voodoo has no time to investigate Roland's smile—in fact, she is consumed by Loki's endless fury and has no time to consider.																						
104	104		301									Voodoo's leg slams into Roland with extra strength generated by her wings and thruster.																						
105	105		301									Knocked back by a strike, Roland collapses to the ground, waving his hand and coughing. Vital fluid drips down from the corner of his mouth.																						
106	106		301								Roland	C'mon, at least tell me why you want me dead.	1																					
107	107		301									The conflict has inevitably attracted someone else's attention. At this moment, Roland's plan is finally complete.																						
108	108		301								Roland	Did your boss not say anything?	1																					
109	109		301								Roland	Or... cough... are you just a mercenary, hired to take my life?	1																					
110	110		301									She pauses a little after hearing Roland's words.

113	113		301									It only buys him a little time before something else takes off from the forest.																						
114	114		301									It flies over the forest, cliff and Roland, hovering, releasing blistering heat from its exhaust air.																						
115	115		301									On the other side, No. 21 struggles to tighten her body as her instincts tell her danger is close.																						
116	116		301									The trees are blown apart by the hot air, revealing a white object between them—																						
117	117		201							1	500328	4																						
118	118		301							1	No. 21	...I'm spotted!	1

124	124		301							1	Voodoo?	...	1																					
125	125		301								Voodoo?	This scent... this scent?! What a scent!	1																					
126	126		301									The storm howls. Small rocks fall from the cliff as the metal beast spreads her bladed wings, pulling up rocks and fallen leaves around her, adorned with the moon as a crown. She baths in the blood-red moonlight, her shadow stretching infinitely, and she looks like a claw extended right out of the moon.																						
127	127		301									The next moment, she suddenly bursts into a twisted growl. Her body twitches, arching into an unnatural curve, and you are baffled by what is happening.																						
128	128		301								Voodoo?	Chirp-chirp, chirp-chirp, chirp-chirp-chirp...	1																					
129	129		301									A low, rustling sound comes out of the monstrosity's throat, getting louder and louder.																						
130	130		301									No, not rustling... laughing. She is laughing from excitement!																						
131	131		301									An excitement... to kill!																						
132	132		301									She chirps and laughs, her monotonic and extended voice sending a chill down your spine like the scream of babies abandoned in the sewer.																						
133	133		301								Voodoo?	Chirp-chirp... hahahahAHAHAHAHAHA!!!	1																					
134	134		301									Her voice suddenly turns into a continuous, high-pitched shriek, filled with equal parts terror and delight. Only a tormented soul in hell could have made such an inhuman sound.																						
135	135		301								Voodoo?	I'm here—here! I'M HERE!	1																					
136	136		301								Voodoo?	Mister must be so disappointed! He picked such a useless scrub!	1																					
137	137		301								Voodoo?	But... if Voodoo brings him his new toys alive—he'll be happy! Mister will be so happy!	1
