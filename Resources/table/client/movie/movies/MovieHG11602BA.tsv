3	3		301			DialogEnable						Two hours into waiting for him in his "secret lair," you finally find Changyu slipping through the door.																						
4	4		201							1	500225	2																						
5	5		301							1	Changyu	Haha, sorry for leaving y'all up there.	1																					
6	6		301									Cheekily he shrugs and wipes off the rain from his mechanical parts, looking anything but apologetic.																						
7	7		204							1	3																							
8	8		301								Changyu	So, what are you doing here? Is Babylonia after that black market as well?	1																					
9	9		302								That's right.	10	What about you?	10																				
10	10		204							1																								
11	11		301								Changyu	Hmm, well, well...	1																					
12	12		301									Changyu takes a long look at the four of you and stops when his eyes reach your tired appearance.																						
13	13		204							1	1																							
14	14		301								Changyu	You look like you'd walked through a rainstorm. And when was the last time you rest up?	1																					
15	15		202							1																								
16	16		301									He deftly climbs up the racks behind him and throws a box down.																						
17	9596		401							1	208																							
18	17		201							1	500225	1																						
19	18		301							1	Changyu	C'mon, let's get you something to eat.	1																					
20	19		302							311	That's not necessary.	22	That's unusually generous of you.	23																				
21	20		204							1	2																							
22	21		303							311																								
23	22	24	301								Changyu	Let's call it my apologies—not to mention that there's this itsy-bitsy problem I can use your help with.	1																					
24	23		301								Changyu	Ha, nothing can get past you! There's this itsy-bitsy problem I can use your help with.	1																					
25	24		302								What problem?	26	Anything to do with that man back there?	26																				
26	26		301								Changyu	Oh, slow down!	1																					
27	25		204							1	1																							
28	27		301									Changyu tears open the box he took, grabbing two cans of canned food, a couple of condiments, and a self-heating cooking pot.																						
29	28		302								Um...	29	...	29																				
30	29		301								Changyu	C'mon, it's obviously just food stocked in the warehouses.	1																					
31	30		301								Changyu	One of Akdilek's many ventures is reselling food. Occasionally I'll "liberate" some of the ingredients upstairs and keep them here.	1																					
32	31		301								Changyu	Y'know, just to reminisce... how people used to gather and feast.	1																					
33	32		301								Changyu	Sure, I no longer have to eat, but I still love to cook. It's nice when others enjoy my cooking.	1																					
34	33		301									He deftly opens the red can and mixes in a few different spices, stirring everything together. Next is the white can, which he opens and takes out a few white, circular discs.																						
35	34		203							1	0.25	-400																						
36	35		201							2	1031001	1	400																					
37	36		301							1	Liv	Are those... made with actual flour?	2																					
38	37		301								Changyu	That's right; these are wrappers for this famous Kowloong dish called "jiaozi." Y'all can give it a try once I'm done!	1																					
39	38		201							2	500166		400																					
40	39		301							1	Lucia	—If the commandant approves.	2																					
41	40		302							1000	Well, they are made by Changyu...	1044	Well, if these are made in Kowloong...	1045																				
42	41		202							2					1																			
43	42		203							1	0.25	0																						
44	43		303							1000																								
45	1044		204							1	13																							
46	44	1046	301								Changyu	Ha! Is that a compliment, or are you just worried?	1																					
47	1045		204							1	13																							
48	45		301								Changyu	To be fair, Kowloong doesn't make these cans the way they used to.	1																					
49	1046		204							1	1																							
50	46		301									He spoons out a portion of the fillings from the red can and stuffs them into a piece of wrapper. Holding it in his palm, he folds the edges of the wrapper and turns the whole fare into a wrinkly dough.																						
51	47		301								Changyu	They ought to look better, but that would be way too much work for me, so you'll have to make do with this.	1																					
52	48		301									Changyu's hands briskly move around as he speaks. Before you know it, he has finished wrapping a whole plate of jiaozi.																						
53	49		302								That was quick!	50																						
54	50		301								Changyu	Oh? Maybe it's because the motion of wrapping jiaozi is pretty similar to my martial art training. Check this out—	1																					
55	51		301									Changyu slows down his movement to demonstrate. With a wrapper in his left hand and the spoon on his right, he takes some fillings from the can and stuffs them into his left palm.																						
56	52		301								Changyu	...And squeeze. Done!	1																					
57	53		302								It does look like the opening moves of a martial art set.	54	If you just ignore how they turn out...	56																				
58	54		204							1	2																							
59	55	58	301								Changyu	Right? It makes sense once you speed it up.	1																					
60	56		204							1	13																							
61	57		301								Changyu	Tch. Picky eaters get field rations for dinner.	1																					
62	58		204							1	1																							
63	59		301									Changyu turns around and grabs a bucket hanging on a nearby pipe, pouring the water inside into the cooking pot.																						
64	60		201							1	500166																							
65	61		301							1	Lucia	The piping still works here?	1																					
66	62		201							1	500225	1																						
67	63		301							1	Changyu	It's more of a filter than a pipe, if anything. It purifies the rainwater collected above ground.	1																					
68	64		301								Changyu	Relax, though. Sure, it's not completely sterilized, but it's clean enough to drink.	1																					
69	65		301									Throwing the jiaozi into the pot, Changyu seasons them with a pinch of salt. The water quickly begins bubbling.																						
70	66		301								Changyu	Almost there...	1																					
71	67		301									He lightly rinses the plate in his hand with the boiling water.																						
72	68		201							1	1031001	1																						
73	69		301							1	Liv	What was that?	1																					
74	70		201							1	500225	1																						
75	71		301							1	Changyu	You mean rinsing the plate with hot water? That's just common Kowloong practice. Our people believe doing so keeps the containers clean and the eaters healthy.	1																					
76	72		301									With that, Changyu fishes out a whole plate of... grotesque and twisted shapes.																						
77	73		301								Changyu	And done! Give it a try!	1																					
78	74		302								...A try it is.	75	...I could use a little courage here.	75																				
79	75		204							1	13																							
80	76		301								Changyu	If they taste bad, it's because you've got bad taste.	1																					
81	77		202							1					1																			
82	78		301									You pick one up with a fork as everyone has their eyes on you—																						
83	79		302								Yummy!	80	Hot! Hot!	82																				
84	80		201							1	500225	2																						
85	81	84	301							1	Changyu	Told ya!	1																					
86	82		201							1	500225	3																						
87	83		301							1	Changyu	This isn't your typical rations, you moron! Blow on the food before you stuff it in your mouth.	1																					
88	84		202							1					1																			
89	85		301									Taking a closer look at your half-eaten dumpling, you cannot believe how fragrant this swirling mess of black and brown bits is.																						
90	86		301									...Even though the boiled wrapper looks like a piece of crumpled paper in the trash. But, hey, there is no denying that it is indeed very tasty.																						
91	87		302								This is amazing!	88	Everyone, come and try it!	88																				
92	88		301									Hearing that, the three Gray Ravens look visibly tempted.																						
93	89		201							1	500166																							
94	90		301							1	Lucia	Not that we have to eat—but if you recommend it, Commandant, then...	1																					
95	91		301									Lucia only thinks for a moment before picking up one for a bite.																						
96	92		204							1	1																							
97	93		301								Lucia	Is this what Kowloong cuisine tastes like? It's really wonderful. Do you guys want one?	1																					
98	94		201							1	1031001	1																						
99	95		301							1	Liv	I'd like to try one...	1																					
100	96		301									Liv grabs the fork from Lucia and takes a bite.																						
101	97		204							1	6																							
102	98		301								Liv	It's quite delicious. Let me run a scan on the ingredients... Oh, the nutritional balance is well-thought-out as well. Commandant, you can eat as much as you want.	1																					
103	99		201							1	500166		-400																					
104	100		201							2	500026		400																					
105	101		301							1	Lucia	How about you, Lee?	1																					
106	1102		204							2	10																							
107	102		301								Lee	I'll pass. Save them for the commandant.	2																					
108	103		202							1	2				1																			
109	9597		401							1	203																							
110	104		201							1	500225	1																						
111	105		301							1	Changyu	Now, some thoughts to go with your food.	1																					
112	106		302								(Munch munch munch)	107	Shoot.	107																				
113	107		301								Changyu	This adulterating business has been bad business for Akdilek as well.	1																					
114	108		301								Changyu	The counterfeits are barely discernable, and it takes way too long to inspect every single one of 'em. We'll be forced to use the knockoffs in any emergency.	1																					
115	109		201							1	500166																							
116	110		301							1	Lucia	Our bases on the ground are similarly compromised.	1																					
117	111		201							1	500225																							
118	112		301							1	Changyu	Regardless...	1																					
119	113		301									Changyu pulls up a chair to his side. Leaning on it, he fiddles with the spoon he used earlier, looking buried in thought.																						
120	114		301								Changyu	I'm very close to seeing their boss. I imagine he's got information y'all want.	1																					
121	115		302								That's right.	116	(Nod)	116																				
122	116		301								Changyu	How about a deal? Get rid of the man by my side, and you get to keep his token.	1																					
123	117		301								Changyu	His clothes as well, so you can play dress-up afterward, and we'll pay their boss a visit together.	1																					
124	118		302								Who's that man?	119																						
125	119		301								Changyu	A mole from the dock. He was planted on Akdilek originally, but now he just keeps tabs on me.	1																					
126	120		302								Can't you take him out yourself?	121																						
127	121		301								Changyu	Of course I can! But they know I'll beat his ass, so they've installed this irritating device on me as a contingency.	1																					
128	122		302								If we act unprovoked...	123	What about the "inside men" he mentioned?	123																				
129	123		301								Changyu	Relax. Do me this favor, and I'll take care of the rest.	1																					
130	124		201							1	500166		-400																					
131	125		201							2	500026		400																					
132	126		301							1	Lucia	You'll be putting the commandant in harm's way.	1																					
133	127		301								Lee	And why would we have to stick our noses into your "family matters"?	2																					
134	128		202							1	2				1																			
135	129		201							1	500225	2																						
136	130		301							1	Changyu	Are you holding a grudge, Lee? And I thought we were family!	1																					
137	131		204							1	1																							
138	132		301								Changyu	Look, get ahold of the token, and it'll take us to whoever is in charge. You can find out any information you need.	1																					
139	133		301								Changyu	We businessmen call it—	1																					
140	134		201							1	500026	10																						
141	135		301							1	Lee	Venturing.	1																					
142	136		201							1	500225	3																						
143	137		301							1	Changyu	WIN—WIN—It's a win-win!	1																					
144	138		204							1	1																							
145	139		301								Changyu	You know what, it doesn't matter—I just need 【kuroname】 alone. So what do you say?	1																					
146	140		302								Deal.	141	...This is the path of least resistance.	141																				
147	141		301								Changyu	That's the spirit!	1																					
148	142		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Changyu	In that case, Commandant, I await your command!	1
