6	6		301									Liv picks up the stack of cards inside the box and notices a note sticking at the back.

8	8		301									"Go home and stay with your partner on this rare night of the Double Seventh Festival! Use this present well. That's the most I can do for you!"

10	10		301									Liv stops saying it out loud after a few words, and her cheek burns red after reading the note.																						
11	11		301								Liv	C-Commandant... Being a p-partner might be... It's just that I'm hoping to focus on our mission before the fight is over...	1																					
12	12		302								(Explain where the mystery box comes from)	13																						
13	13		204							1	10																							
14	14		301								Liv	Phew... So you didn't know what was inside the box either. "Anything I Want"... I don't think I want anything aside from help on our mission.	1																					
15	15		204							1																								
16	16		301								Liv	Not to mention that I find it... difficult to ask someone to do something I can do just with a card.	1																					
17	17		302								Would you say no if someone you care about asks you to do something simple together?	18																						
18	18		204							1	3																							
19	19		301								Liv	O-of course not!	1																					
20	20		302								How would you feel about that, then?	21																						
21	21		204							1	1																							
22	22		301								Liv	If it's someone I care about... I'd feel glad to be needed.	1																					
23	23		301									You are not sure what kind of scenario Liv is thinking about, but you see a faint smile on her face as she answers you.																						
24	24		302								I think the people you care about would love to be needed in the same way.	25																						
25	25		301									Her eyes sparkle under the starlight. Determined, she slowly takes out one of the cards and hands it to you.																						
26	26		301								Liv	In that case, can I ask you to walk me back to the Gray Raven lounge, Commandant?	1																					
27	27		302								I'd love to.	28
