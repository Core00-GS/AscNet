4	4		301			DialogEnable						Upon the tallest tower on the Nighter, a Construct in a mask is half-kneeling on the floor, her head lowered, waiting quietly for her actual mistress.																						
5	5		301									Soon, the Construct hears her mistress' familiar footsteps, and an imposing woman steps forward from the dark hall. The Construct lowers her head further.

11	11		301							1	Yazi	As you wish... "Lady Qu", your subjects have gathered in the square with the projection screens. Is there something else I should prepare?	2																					
12	12		301								"Qu"	That's not necessary... I'm not my pompous sister. I have no desire to waste my breath on them.	1																					
13	13		301								"Qu"	I have no need for "will" on the Nighter... What they should follow are "rules." That is their only "value."	1																					
14	14		301								Yazi	I understand. This is the only way this ship sails on the right course, as Huaxu told us.	2																					
15	15		301								"Qu"	Yazi... would you think I'm doing something foolish?	1																					
16	16		301									To despise humans while being one—to despise humans while being their "monarch," shouldering the responsibility of carrying on Kowloong's legacy on this vessel.																						
17	17		301								Yazi	I think... there's no one better for this role than you.	2																					
18	18		301									Looking at the ill-fitting attire on herself, "Qu" smiles, her true thoughts hidden.

20	20		301								"Qu"	In the end, all I can do is steal her name and her role. Perhaps that's only fitting—a false monarch for a false prosperous time.	1

23	23		301								"Qu"	Yazi, turn on the video system. This will be my first time on the stage in this role and perhaps my last. Here begins the endless night.	1

32	32		301									2. "Miles" must be obtained with grubs earned in any way necessary. Everyone with zero "miles" will be sentenced to death.																						
33	33		301									3. The Nighter is to sail on the ocean until the calamity is over. Everyone who leaves or boards the Nighter without permission will be sentenced to death.																						
34	34		301									4. Those who are chosen to be the Children of Kowloong after becoming a Construct will gain the right to stay on the Nighter forever and bear witness to our glorious future when we return to Kowloong.

43	43		301								Huaxu	The administrator logged in. Welcome, Master Villier.	1																					
44	44		301									Hearing Huaxu's usual greetings, the Construct Villier reveals a rare, gentle smile.																						
45	45		201							1	500150																							
46	46		301							1	Villier	You're probably the only one left who'd call me "Villier"... But that's enough. I don't need someone else to understand who I am.	1																					
47	47		301									Huaxu's figure flickers as if thinking about something.																						
48	48		201							1	500160																							
49	49		301							1	Huaxu	The passengers' survival rate is, in fact, increasing compared to the simulations done every half an hour after your initial announcement. I want to understand why you did it, Master Villier.	1																					
50	50		301									Villier turns on the surveillance system, monitoring the different corners of the Nighter lives.																						
51	51		201							1	500150																							
52	52		301							1	Villier	Huaxu, you still don't fully understand humans... You have to understand them to manipulate them well.	1																					
53	53		301								Villier	Apart from a few, most people who boarded the Nighter were the working class who struggled under Qu's rules. These seemingly authoritative but extremely pliable rules are in fact an opportunity.	1																					
54	54		301								Villier	They will welcome our policies with open arms and work tirelessly to earn these "miles," building us exceptional Constructs. Then, one day... I will find a Construct that can become your body.	1																					
55	55		201							1	500160																							
56	56		301								Huaxu	My body...	1																					
57	57		301									Villier tries to caress Huaxu's face. Even though he knows the figure before him is just a hologram, he is still disappointed that his touch meets only air.																						
58	58		201							1	500150																							
59	59		301								Villier	I once thought not to rely on humans as well... I thought I could build you a perfect body with my own hands.	1																					
60	60		301								Villier	That was the most flawless mechanoid I'd ever built—or so I thought. Even when I tailored it for you, its logic system still failed to adapt to your consciousness, a mind that uses the same architecture of Gestalt.	1																					
61	61		301								Villier	But it made me realize that only a Construct's M.I.N.D. is ideal for you.	1																					
62	62		301									Huaxu's form flickers again. Emotions and self-awareness take root in Huaxu's constant calculations and reflections.																						
63	63		201							1	500160																							
64	64		301								Huaxu	What happened to that failed mechanoid?	1																					
65	65		301									Villier looks a little surprised to find Huaxu curious about a mechanoid.																						
66	66		201							1	500150																							
67	67		301								Villier	It accidentally generated excess human sentiments... even produced its own thoughts during its development. It was a defective product that lost its value. The Nighter has no use for defective products.	1																					
68	68		301									Villier recalls how the mechanoid stared at him with the gaze of a human. Even when Villier was the one who granted it a mind, it still turned out like the humans he despised the most.																						
69	69		301								Villier	It was left behind in Kowloong, so I assume it has long been infected by the Punishing Virus and turned into a Corrupted, probably destroyed in a fight with humans.	1																					
70	70		201							1	500160																							
71	71		301								Huaxu	Lost... death... destruction... "value"... What is the value I produce?	1																					
72	72		301									Villier walks toward the hologram, looking into Huaxu's eyes, his gaze conveying boundless affection.																						
73	73		201							1	500150	1																						
74	74		301								Villier	Your existence itself is your value... You are the only perfect existence in this world. Nothing matters except you. This planet and this ship are just a cradle, existing only for your perfection.	1																					
75	75		301									Huaxu flickers again, the light flashing on Villier's passionate face.																						
76	76		204							1																								
77	77		301								Villier	That's it for today... I'll be working on your system expansion next in preparation for your eventual frame.	1																					
78	78		301								Villier	Therefore, I'm hoping you can take my place as "Qu" to govern the affairs on the Nighter by remote-controlling the Construct I built in Qu's image.	1																					
79	79		301								Villier	Then, you might be able to witness more closely... how despicable humanity is.	1																					
80	80		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Villier takes one last look at Huaxu's flickering hologram before turning away and heading into the laboratory in the dark.
