13	13		301							1	John	It was a story I heard from the last Smith, back when I was becoming a "real Smith". He told me it was only natural for the hero to challenge the demon king.	2																					
14	14		301							1	John	The hero had to go and defeat the demon king. That was his duty.	2																					
15	15		301							1	John	He started training since childhood and, at the youngest possible age, embarked on a crusade against the demon king.	2																					
16	16		301							1	John	His life was dictated by fate and by other people. His own will didn't matter.	2																					
17	17		301							1	John	And finally when he came face to face with the demon king, the latter asked: "Will you take my life, or half of the world?"	2

24	24		301							1	John	Exactly. His answer was "half of the world". Only those who have made tough decisions in life can appreciate the ingenuity of that answer. That said, I don't want the next Smith to be a hero.	2
