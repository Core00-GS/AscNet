15	13		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						Like I said, hello there, friend.																						
16	14		301									This should be the last message. What is before me is death.																						
17	15		301									After this, there likely won't be someone with the leisure to leave an infinite message loop on the public channels.																						
18	16		301									I'm a coward, a scoundrel—it's why I knew from the beginning that I might not walk to the end of my path.																						
19	17		301									I'm a coward, a scoundrel—even so, I'm leaving a final message... Three voice recordings, to loop infinitely and play on all channels.																						
20	18		301									To avoid the Ascendants, I've limited the power of the signal transmission to a small range, and it is also masked. Sorry if you took it for the ravings of a madman.																						
21	19		301									When the future of the Ascension-Network collapsed before my eyes, I knew that I had no choice but to tell others what I knew.																						
22	20		301									Shark-speare, the last resort, is probably no longer under my control anymore. I'll likely be devoured by it, and turned into mulch to make Heteromers.																						
23	21		301									But, it's okay. My knowledge is hidden in the sixth section of my spine. It's not something that can be destroyed by its teeth.																						
24	22		301									I will die here. So I leave everything to you. I'm not a good person, but may humanity find this ember that I leave.																						
25	23		301									My friend.

43	39		301									Vera, fighting with Gabriel afar. Karenina, Camu, and the others are trying to stop the Corrupted from closing in.																						
44	40		301									And in the middle of the plaza is a huge, child-like statue of a cartoonish shark...																						
45	41		301									"Shark-speare, the last resort, is probably no longer under my control anymore. I'll likely be devoured by it, and turned into mulch to make Heteromers."
