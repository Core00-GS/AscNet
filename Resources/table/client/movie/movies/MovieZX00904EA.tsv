4	3		301			DialogEnable				1	Lee	Incredible acceleration and flexibility... Like it was designed specifically for space combat...	1																					
5	4		301								Lee	Why do the Forsakens have such an advanced frame?	1																					
6	5		201							1	500080																							
7	6		301							1	Watanabe	Babylonia would design more advanced frames for Constructs with outstanding performance to further enhance their abilities.	1																					
8	7		301								Watanabe	You must've heard of that tradition.	1																					
9	8		201							1	1011001																							
10	9		301							1	Lee	Babylonia...? If that's the case, the only possibility is, from when you were still in Babylonia...	1																					
11	10		201							1	500080																							
12	11		301							1	Watanabe	Correct. It's got great performance but isn't really new.	1																					
13	12		301								Watanabe	As to how I got it... I don't think I need to report to your commandant about that, do I?	1																					
14	13		302								I think you should report it to me...	14	I guess you don't need to.	15																				
15	14	16	301								Watanabe	It's just only one of the normal conditions for my agreement.	1																					
16	15		301								Watanabe	Your commandant said no need to.	1

20	19		301							1	Lucia	Watanabe...	1																					
21	20		301								Lucia	Never thought we would fight side by side again.	1																					
22	21		201							1	500080																							
23	22		301							1	Watanabe	Same here.	1																					
24	23		201							1	1031001																							
25	24		301							1	Liv	...	1																					
26	25		301								Liv	...Why are you here, Watanabe?	1																					
27	26		201							1	500080																							
28	27		301							1	Watanabe	Are you worried that I may do something to trigger the conflict between the Forsakens and Babylonia again?	1																					
29	28		301								Watanabe	I made a deal with those hypocrites.	1																					
30	29		301								Watanabe	At least for now, we're using each other.	1																					
31	30		301								Watanabe	Happy with my answer?	1																					
32	31		302								That's not what we meant.	32	...	32																				
33	32		301								Watanabe	...	1																					
34	33		201							1	1031001																							
35	34		301							1	Liv	...I see.	1																					
36	35		201							1	500080																							
37	36		301							1	Watanabe	But helping you here isn't part of my agreement. I'm doing it for free.	1																					
38	37		201							1	1011001																							
39	38		301							1	Lee	What's your purpose then?	1																					
40	39		201							1	500080																							
41	40		301							1	Watanabe	Can't it be just sympathy?	1																					
42	41		201							1	1011001																							
43	42		301							1	Lee	...	1																					
44	43		201							1	500080																							
45	44		301							1	Watanabe	...Alright, I'll cut straight to the point.	1
