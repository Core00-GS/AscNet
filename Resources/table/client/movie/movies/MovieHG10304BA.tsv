5	5		302								You're leaving already?	6	Can't you help me out?	6																				
6	6		301								Celica	Taking proper rests is important too! Not that I can help you with Gray Raven business, anyway.	1																					
7	7		301								Celica	You should be familiar with the process and preparations for connections as well. So go connect now!	1

14	13		302								Good evening.	14	What are you doing, Liv?	14																				
15	14		301								Liv	Good eveningâ€”why are you connecting with me at this hour, Commandant?	1																					
16	15		301								Liv	I'm just sorting out the documents. Some new files got sent to us halfway through.	1																					
17	16		301								Liv	They're related to the base. You just have to verify them after I'm done, Commandant.	1																					
18	17		302								That should have been my job.	18	You can leave this to me.																					
19	18		301								Liv	The connection handbook doesn't recommend commandants working late at night, so please allow me to take care of these trivial matters for you.	1																					
20	19		301								Liv	Constructs don't need sleep, but you don't come with a frame like ours, Commandant.	1																					
21	20		301								Liv	And didn't I just tell you to go rest? Why are you still connecting with me at this hour, Commandant?	1																					
22	21		301								Liv	I decided to take on the paperwork so that you can improve your wellbeing. If you still insist on overworking yourself...	1																					
23	22		301								Liv	Then everything I did was in vain.	1																					
24	23		301								Liv	So, please disconnect now, Commandant. I'd have to sever the connection either way lest my efficiency drops.	1																					
25	24		302								Eh?	25	Hold on, Liv!	25																				
26	25		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin				Liv	Just... stop bothering me, Commandant!	1
