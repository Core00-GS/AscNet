3	3		301			DialogEnable						One ordinary afternoon in Eden.																						
4	4		301									Sitting in front of her desk, the girl is writing a letter in elegant cursive. Warm artificial sunlight shines through the window, following the tip of her pen.																						
5	5		301									—...I'll wait for you.																						
6	6		301									—I'll be wearing an Iris behind my ear. You'll recognize me for sure.																						
7	7		301									She presses the pen slightly harder against the paper, soaking it as she finishes the letter off with a full stop. She wipes the ink off her pen and puts it back into the box.																						
8	8		301									She picks up the letter, folds it, then puts it into an envelope and seals it.																						
9	9		301									After all the actions, she sighs in relief and stands up.																						
10	10		301									With her hands crossed, she presses the envelope close to her chest as if she is making a prayer. Then she collapses onto her bed, facing the ceiling.																						
11	11		301									The lights on the ceiling have been reconfigured by her to resemble the starry sky. It is still early in the afternoon, and the "stars" aren't lighting up yet.																						
12	12		301									Soon, she will be posting the letter out.																						
13	13		301									What should she say first if she really sees 【kuroname】 in person?																						
14	14		301									She never thought that she would be so troubled by a simple opening speech.																						
15	15		301									Would "Nice to meet you" be too distant? They have never met, but she thinks they have known each other well enough after having exchanged so many letters.																						
16	16		301									Not to mention that they could have walked past each other long ago at somewhere in Eden.																						
17	17		301									Will that person also be looking forward to the meet just like she is?																						
18	18		301									The only thing she can confirm is that she has many things to share with that person. Way too many for letters to hold.

20	20		301							1	Selena	What to do...	1																					
21	21		301									Unable to contain her thoughts, she rolls over on the bed, buries her head in the soft pillow and sighs.																						
22	22		301									There are still many days before the event, but she can't help thinking about what she needs to do on that day.																						
23	23		301									What would make a nice self-introduction? What sort of gesture should she take during the dance? And... She must remember to hold her excitement and not do anything inappropriate.																						
24	24		301									—At least she does not need to worry about the dress. She has someone she can fully trust when it comes to advices on attire and outfit.																						
25	25		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					She turns around and looks at a blueprint design on the side table. Its designer has written some comments on it.																						
26	26		202							1					1																			
27	27		304			AniZhuanchangEnd				The frame's coating is inspired by tango and its structure has taken reference from dancers, making it a great unit for dancing.	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
28	28		304							You said you had an important ball coming, right?	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
29	29		304							And I'm still mad at you for applying to become a Construct behind my back!	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
30	30		304							So just leave it all to me this time!	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1																			
31	31		304				AniZhuanchangBegin			Right, the dress is still missing one important accessory. Is there anything that comes to your mind? I need your advice!	cc82cfff	1	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory00.png		1			1																
32	32		201							1	500282	1																						
33	33		301			AniZhuanchangEnd				1		Not long ago, her best friend was telling her the inspirations she got on her new frame design.																						
34	34		301									According to her plan, the frame would be ready for first adaptation on the day of the WGAA ball. It may not be combat-ready, but is more than enough for a dance.																						
35	35		301									Still lost in thought, she catches a glance of the envelope in her hand. It is carefully sealed by wax, with a golden, six-petal flower stamped on top.																						
36	36		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					Something has come to her mind.

40	40		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						"—O courteous shade! Thou whose fame yet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts!"																						
41	41		301									...																						
42	42		301									You sense a strange distortion in the objectives in your vision. You shake your head to cast it away, then look back at the surroundings.																						
43	43		301				AniZhuanchangBegin					The world in your vision changes again.																						
44	44		101							Assets/Product/Texture/Image/BgStory/BgStory15.jpg																								
45	45		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						It is the fabulous front yard of the opera house, full of guests in gorgeous outfits. The melody of waltz starts from afar, making your stagnant mind start to move again.																						
46	46		301									Right, you're waiting for someone.																						
47	47		301									When you remember it, you hear a long, vague song from a distant place, as if it comes from a creature that does not belong here. You could not tell what it is.																						
48	48		401							1	81																							
49	49		301									You look up, trying to look for it. A bell rings, and a brilliant violet comes to the vision.																						
50	50		301									It's a girl. She walks over with a warm smile, her long hair flying behind like the wings of a mockingbird.																						
51	51		201							1	500430																							
52	52		301							1	???	Hello.	1																					
53	53		301								???	If I may... Have we met before?	1																					
54	54		301									The iris on her hair is blooming in the night. The pure purple is reflected in her eyes, lighting up the excitement in them.																						
55	55		301									She has recognized you.																						
56	56		302								Iris.	57	Selena...	62																				
57	57		302								Hi, I'm 【kuroname】.	58																						
58	58		301								Iris	【kuroname】.	1																					
59	59		301									Iris repeats after you softly, and she smiles like a flower.																						
60	60		204							1	2																							
61	61	68	301								Iris	We have finally met.	1																					
62	62		301									You call out that name before you realize.																						
63	63		301									The girl is slightly shocked. Her purple eyes have darkened.																						
64	64		301									But she smiles again the next moment.																						
65	65		204							1	2																							
66	66		301								Iris	I am your Iris.	1																					
67	67		301								Iris	I have finally met you, 【kuroname】.	1																					
68	68		301									You just stand there, looking at each other without any words.																						
69	69		301									You have a lot to tell each other and a lot of questions to ask, but you just stare at each other in silence as if time has frozen.																						
70	70		301									The ball has started and guests are going in. People keep giving weird looks when they walk past.																						
71	71		301									—It's that famous young opera singer. Why is she...																						
72	72		301									—Construct...																						
73	73		301									—It's not a rumor. Who would have thought? Even she has...																						
74	74		301									—Does it have anything to do with "The Acadia Evacuation" being halted indefinitely?																						
75	75		301									—Hey, someone ask her for an autograph.																						
76	76		301									—Did she give up on art?																						
77	77		301									You hear many whispers.																						
78	78		301									Slightly upset, you walk forward and shield her from the various looks they exchange.																						
79	79		204							1																								
80	80		301								Iris	Is everything alright?	1																					
81	81		301									The girl's crystal clear eyes are always on you, completely unaware that she has become the crowd's focus.																						
82	82		301									Perhaps she has already accepted everything of her past. Now she is standing in the tempest as a warrior, with even purer faith and love.																						
83	83		301									—Just like the original form of her soul.																						
84	84		302								Yeah... It's all good.	87																						
85	85		401							1	36																							
86	86		401					500		1	81																							
87	87		301									The waltz has come to an end. After a short break, the instruments start to play again. You hear a tango melody.																						
88	88		301									The next dance has started.																						
89	89		301									You realize you are standing on the edge of the hall.																						
90	90		302								(Take initiative to invite)	91	(Remain silent)	101																				
91	91		301									Without hesitation, you reach out to her.																						
92	92		302								Iris.	93																						
93	93		302								Would you like to dance with me?	94																						
94	94		301									The girl blinks and blushes. She crosses her fingers in slight regret.																						
95	95		301									—I was supposed to ask first.																						
96	96		301									Hearing the mumble, you recall the "guidance" she mentioned in the letters and chuckle.																						
97	97		301									The girl has already placed her hand in your palm. It feels a little cold, but your heart is softly touched.																						
98	98		204							1	2																							
99	99		301								Iris	It's my honor, 【kuroname】.	1																					
100	100		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					You take her hand and walk into the brilliant ball room.																						
101	101		301									With most days spent in missions and combat drills, it is the first time you come to an occasion like this. You feel a little awkward and lost looking at the chandeliers and dancing guests.																						
102	102		301									Iris notices your hesitation.																						
103	103		301								Iris	【kuroname】.	1																					
104	104		301									She smiles and raises her hand, making a flawless gesture.																						
105	105		301								Iris	May I invite you for a dance?	1																					
106	106		301									The girl extends her long, svelte arm. But you know very well that now that she has become a Construct, there is great strength both in those arms and in her mind.																						
107	107		301									The iris-colored eyes look at you, cheering you up quietly and gently.																						
108	108		301									You rest your hand in her palm without hesitation.																						
109	109		302								It's my honor.	110																						
110	110		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					Iris takes your hand and walks into the brilliant ball room.
