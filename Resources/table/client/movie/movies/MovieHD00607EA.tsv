21	21		301							1	Liv	I've heard others say that although the bionic machines in the past were programmed with emotions, they were ultimately an imitation.	1																					
22	22		301								Liv	They knew to "cry when upset," but they didn't know what really constituted "upset."	1																					
23	23		301								Liv	"If someone by your side isn't moving, then they must be dead. If someone by your side is dead, then that is worth being upset."	1

28	28		301								Lee	All their actions are just optimizing predetermined solutions.	2																					
29	29		301								Lee	Crying when you are sad, for mechanoids, means that all you need to do is cry when you are sad.	2																					
30	30		301								Lee	Why be sad? Why cry? These... are the choices that a "soul" makes, not an AI.	2

76	76		301								Lucia	In your opinion, do we look more human? Or machine?	1																					
77	77		302								Why are you asking me this all of a sudden?	78																						
78	78		301								Lucia	I know that we are the commandant's weapon. Or rather... humanity's weapon.	1																					
79	79		301								Lucia	...	1																					
80	80		302								The answer is obviousâ€”like a human.	81	More like a machine.	87	You're both.	94
