11	7		301									As expected, the explosives tear a crack in the light wall. Yet the explosives were only meant for combat, not wall-breaching. The light wall takes minimal damage.																						
12	8		301			PanelActor2Shake						The crack seals itself almost instantaneously. In a last ditch effort, Kamui tosses his weapon aside and dives in, forcefully keeping the aperture open with his back against one side.

15	12		301									Despite saying so, Chrome is already in action. He leaps across the idiotic Kamui, and together they hold the small crack open.

24	16		301									The light wall behind them cuts open their clothes and grazes their skin. Their synth-skin vaporizes almost instantly, revealing bare mechanical parts.																						
25	17		301								Kamui	Honestly, Chrome, this kinda hurts...	2																					
26	18		301								Chrome	Just... "kinda?" Kamui, you need to get your pain receptors checked when we get back.	1																					
27	19		301								Kamui	Bleeeugh, I hate getting body checks though...	2																					
28	20		301								Chrome	...Keep pushing, and maybe I'll consider letting you skip one.	1

33	21		301							1		Joining like a sword and a buckler, the two enlarge the crack to the size of a hatch door. The parts of their body in contact with the light wall, however, sinks deeper and deeper, letting off geysers of sparks.
