9	9		201							1	500181	1																						
10	10		301							1	Vera	We never need someone else to "promise" our victory. Oh, and it was Camu who proposed the betrayal. I'm all but a pathetic, weak woman.	1																					
11	11		302								Camu?	12	Did you just call yourself a weak woman...?	13																				
12	12	14	301								Vera	Yeah. Never thought that all-black guy would have the same thought as you did.	1																					
13	13		301								Vera	I was joking, but it still hurts to hear you say that. Want me to show you my female side later?	1																					
14	14		201							1	500176																							
15	15		301							1	Camu	Cut your nonsense... I never asked you to agree with me, Vera.	1

17	17		301							1	King	Is that why you set me up? You filthy heroes!	1																					
18	18		301									The King was at his wit's end. He knew running was not an option. Everyone clenched their weapons, preparing for the last fight.

20	20		301							1	Lee	Sorry for asking, Goddess, but are you absolutely sure that this time there will be no problem at all?	1

22	22		301							1	Goddess	Can you trust me a little? I don't care what this Celica does, but I am the Goddess of this Land of Overlord!	1																					
23	23		301								Goddess	And I never lie!	1																					
24	24		201							1	1081001	1																						
25	25		301							1	Kamui	Um... Now that you mention it, did you name the "Land of Overlord" after your nickname...	1																					
26	26		201							1	500001	5																						
27	27		301							1	Goddess	What?	1																					
28	28		301									Kamui seemed to find out the truth of this game, but he immediately shut up when he saw Celica's face.

30	30		301							1	King	Tsk, fine. Let's do this. Even if you have this main quest, you are still no match for me!	1																					
31	31		301								King	I have accumulated unlimited data for my dream. How can I lose to you heroes, who don't even bother to level up?	1																					
32	32		201							1	500173																							
33	33		301							1	Lee	He has a point. We have never purposely leveled up ourselves...	1																					
34	34		201							1	500166																							
35	35		301							1	Lucia	But we are still heroes. Right, Commandant?	1																					
36	36		302								You're right.	37	Let's beat the King!	37
