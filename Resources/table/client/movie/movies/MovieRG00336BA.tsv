6	6		301									Not only the King, everyone was shocked and stopped to look at the light.																						
7	7		301									The artifact and the Demon King merged together, turning into a blazing sphere, then transformed into a strange surface that resembled a portal.																						
8	8		301									From which a familiar person walked out.																						
9	9		201							1	500001	4																						
10	10		301							1	Celica (?)	Phew... It's been a while since I last appeared with a body.	1																					
11	11		201							1	500174	6																						
12	12		301							1	Liv	It really is her... Miss Celica...	1																					
13	13		301									The artifact answered Liv's call, and turned the Demon King into Celica.																						
14	14		201							1	500173																							
15	15		301							1	Lee	But will it actually help to have Celica here...	1																					
16	16		301									Lee was the first to respond, and his concern was actually everybody's. The artifact might be powerful, but what about Celica?																						
17	17		301								Lee	If she's only a projection from Liv's M.I.N.D... There's no way that she can give us what we need.	1																					
18	18		201							1	500001	5																						
19	19		301							1	Celica (?)	C'mon, you heroes... Are you questioning the power of the Goddess? I'm only using the look of Celica!	1																					
20	20		302								What Goddess?	21	Aren't you the Demon King?	22																				
21	21	23	301								Goddess	Wait, did you just summon me, Goddess Celica, without knowing anything?	1																					
22	22		301								Goddess	The Demon King is now part of me. The Goddess has no body, so I just borrowed his.	1																					
23	23		201							1	500016																							
24	24		301							1	King	It's... It's the Overlord! Ohhhhhh!	1																					
25	25		201							1	500001	5																						
26	26		301							1	Goddess	How many times have I told you not to call me Overlord!	1																					
27	27		301									The King was the second to realize what happened. Unlike us, he immediately shouted out a name.																						
28	28		301									Only to be kicked on the wall before he could even finish.																						
29	29		201							1	500166																							
30	30		301							1	Lucia	At least we don't have to worry about her power. Whether you are Celica, or the Goddess... Could you lend your power to us?	1																					
31	31		201							1	500001																							
32	32		301							1	Goddess	Of course. I answered your call, so I'm on your side, heroes.	1																					
33	33		201							1	500176																							
34	34		301							1	Camu	Please get rid of that King then!	1																					
35	35		201							1	500001																							
36	36		301							1	Goddess	No, heroes, you are the one to finish him off.	1																					
37	37		302								Why?	38	Just kick him a few more times, can't you?	39																				
38	38	40	301								Goddess	The Goddess is set to be the administrator of this game. I can do many things, but I can never kill any being in the game.	1																					
39	39		301								Goddess	Actually, I cannot do much other than delaying him... Didn't you realize the King was not damaged at all?	1																					
40	40		201							1	1081001	17																						
41	41		301							1	Kamui	Um... So much efforts all wasted.	1																					
42	42		201							1	500001	2																						
43	43		301							1	Goddess	Not at all! Remember I said you were the one to finish him off? Right now, I, the Goddess, shall give you the latest main quest!	1																					
44	44		202							1																								
45	45		301									Celica made a "I choose you" pose, and everyone heard a strange system sound. The quest menu was automatically opened.																						
46	46		301								System	Main quest updated: Defeat the evil King.																						
47	47		201							1	500180																							
48	48		301							1	Karenina	The main quest has changed... Hey, is this a system feature...?	1																					
49	49		201							1	500176																							
50	50		301							1	Camu	Correct. We couldn't kill the King because that was a system setting. But right now, our main quest is to defeat the King.	1																					
51	51		301								Camu	That means he is no longer invincible. This quest can now be "completed."	1																					
52	52		201							1	500016																							
53	53		301							1	King	...Ugh, I, I'm not going to die here!	1																					
54	54		202							1																								
55	55		301									Realizing the tide had turned, the King fled further into the Demon King's Castle. Many guards rushed out.																						
56	56		302								Let's go!	57	Get rid of the guards!	57																				
57	57		201							1	500166	5																						
58	58		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin			1	Lucia	Roger. All members, strike!	1
