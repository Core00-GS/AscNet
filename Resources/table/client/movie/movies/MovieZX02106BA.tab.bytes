4	4		301									Another uninvited guest is also visiting the city.																						
5	5		301									She arrives from the depth of the ocean. Being the coward she is, she has brought along all the Corrupted she encountered on her way here. She looks like a returning queen with her army behind her.																						
6	6		301									But Lamia knows that she is no queen.																						
7	7		301									If anything, she is a parasite. She does not despise it‚Äîthat is how she has survived until now, after all.																						
8	8		301									But when everyone she depends on has left, she is forced to think for herself.

10	10		301							1	Lamia	...Is this it?	1																					
11	11		301									When her "feet" touch its surface, a sense of nostalgia and strangeness hits her.																						
12	12		301								Lamia	"That guy" didn't lie.	1																					
13	13		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Lamia	I've... finally found it.	1

22	22		301			AniZhuanchangEnd						She has no idea how long she has walked along the ruins since she climbed out of the collapsed opening, but finally, she sees that familiar robot.

26	26		301							1	Lamia	I have it.	1

28	28		301									The robot extends its arms, ready to retrieve the white cube in Lamia's hands.																						
29	29		301									But she suddenly withdraws her hands and holds the cube in her arms.

34	34		301								Lamia	C-can you... help me with one more thing?	1																					
35	35		201							1	500162

37	37		201							1	500165																							
38	38		301							1	Lamia	I... I've been trying to find a place... but I've forgotten much... I don't remember where it is anymore.	1																					
39	39		204							1	8

46	46		301									Lamia clutches her head with a hand.																						
47	47		301									An unclear number keeps appearing in her head.																						
48	48		301									It seems like a piece of important information engraved in her M.I.N.D., scraped repeatedly, the whole number inaccessible to her. She can only recall the first half of the numbers no matter how hard she tries.																						
49	49		301									No, not a number‚Äîa set of coordinates. Of what she does not remember.																						
50	50		301									All she knows is it is a very important place, a place she must return to. A place of her obsessions.

52	52		301								Lamia	Can I... trust you?	1																					
53	53		201							1	500162																							
54	54		301							1	"421"	Of course. I will do my best.	1																					
55	55		301								"421"	Now, hand that to me, then tell me in detail what it is you want to know.	1																					
56	56		301									The small robot's "eyes" glisten.																						
57	57		301		1		AniZhuanchangBegin					He is curious, after all, about what more he can learn from the desperate Ascendant before him.
