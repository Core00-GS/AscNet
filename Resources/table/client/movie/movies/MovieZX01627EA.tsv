28	28		301									Lucia puts away her katana and walks back. The confused tone in her voice echoes throughout the vast empty space.																						
29	29		301								Lucia	I think... I just heard a Corrupted say my name. I...	2																					
30	30		301								Lee	The neural circuits of the Corrupted have long been destroyed by the Punishing Virus. Maybe you're just hearing things.	1																					
31	31		301								Lee	Or maybe, the data collected contains memories from a Babylonian Construct, which just so happens to contain data about you...	1																					
32	32		302								Data?	33																						
33	33		301								Lee	Well, I retrieved data from the memory shells of the Corrupted we fought in battle just now and screened it for potential intel.	1																					
34	34		301								Lee	After all, we've reached the source of the Red Tide. We don't need to collect info from such a wide area like we did in the city. We just need to screen data through the Spear of F.O.S. to find the useful ones.	1

58	58		301								Construct	Are you... joking...?	2																					
59	59		301									The Construct reaches out his feeble hands into the void. Only the alloy bones of his fingertips remain, their skins having fallen off from all the damage as if he had used them to dig through the hard earth.																						
60	60		301									Beside him is a big crater from an explosion. The things lying at the bottom of the crater are not projected, indicating that the data is damaged.																						
61	61		301									Roland stands on a rock covered in vital fluid next to the crater as he slowly speaks with a menacing tone and an unconcerned smile.																						
62	62		301								Roland	Isn't that good? You no longer have to fear the Punishing Virus. Instead, let it become the power that can destroy everything within your grasp.	1																					
63	63		301									Roland raises his hand like a magnificent conductor. The Punishing Virus wraps around his fingertips and charges toward the Construct.

70	70		301									Kneeling down, they shout and scream mechanically like enthralled apostles, yearning to receive the power of ascension from Luna.																						
71	71		301								Luna	How naive... Only by embracing and accepting it, are you fit to control the power of the Punishing Virus.																						
72	72		301								Roland	To wish for relief—you have already lost your chance.																						
73	73		301								Corrupted	Ugh—!																						
74	74		301									Roland swings his weapon, and the Corrupted is quickly split into two halves.																						
75	75		301								Corrupted	...																						
76	76		301								Roland	To join the core of the Ascension-Network and be bestowed Miss Luna's power, you will have to prove yourself—																						
77	77		301								Roland	Prove that you are crueler... more dreadful... and deadlier... than the virus.																						
78	78		301				AniZhuanchangBegin				Roland	Only so, are you fit to become the owner of the virus, do you understand?

104	104		301								Gabriel	Your preliminary screening is flawed.	2

106	106		301								Gabriel	The test object is screened by the Ascension-Network, but only Miss Luna can grant them ascension. Are you questioning Miss Luna's judgment as an agent?	2

149	149		301							1	Liv	Only Luna, who is an "agent", has the ability to ascend individuals corrupted by the Punishing Virus. The question is whether Luna is the only "agent".	2

151	151		201							1	500026																							
152	152		301								Lee	Well, they don't seem to belong to Luna's forces. So who made them "Ascendants"?	1																					
153	153		301								Lee	According to the number of Ascendants in our intel and the number of remains here in the ruins, we can estimate a success rate of 0.042%.	1

155	155		201							1	500166
