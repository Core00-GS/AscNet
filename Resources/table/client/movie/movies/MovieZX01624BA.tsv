21	21		301								Lucia's Projection	How could I leave you here?!	3																					
22	22		301									She goes to Murol and Xun, trying her best to carry one of them first. At that moment, the long-disconnected former commandant finally contacts her.																						
23	23		301								Former Commandant	...Lucia!																						
24	24		301									He gasps for air as if he has just been through an arduous battle.																						
25	25		301								Lucia's Projection	Commandant! Murol and Xun are seriously wounded. I need support!	3																					
26	26		301								Former Commandant	We can't! I know it's cruel to say this, but leave them there.																						
27	27		301								Former Commandant	I've been ambushed! Get over here and provide backup!																						
28	28		301								Lucia's Projection	I can't abandon our comrades!	3																					
29	29		301								Murol's Projection	Don't worry about us... Xun and I can transfer our memories... We'll see you again... in no time.	1																					
30	30		301								Lucia's Projection	Memory transfer? But that technology is still...	3																					
31	31		301								Xun's Projection	Don't worry... We might lose some memories, but... we'll be fine.	2																					
32	32		301									Xun forces a smile under unbearable pain.																						
33	33		301								Former Commandant	LUCIA!!! Get back here ASAP! We don't have much time!																						
34	34		301									Lucia's projection grits her teeth, showing a sign of reluctance as she leaves her fallen comrades.																						
35	35		301								Xun's Projection	D-don't look so dismal... We'll see each other... in our new frames.	2																					
36	36		301								Lucia's Projection	Okay... Don't break your promise!	3

40	40		301								Xun's Projection	Memory transfer takes time... Hold on a little longer.	2

51	51		301								Lucia	But seeing them there confirms what the commandant said about the incident. It really did happen here.	1

58	58		301								Hassen	Nikola withheld part of it at first out of concerns. He believed doing so would benefit our ongoing fight.	1																					
59	59		301								Hassen	But that only solves our immediate problem. The longer it's held back, the easier Lucia gets lost in confusion and doubt.	1
