21	23		301								Pulao	But... aren't you the one who took us in?	2																					
22	24		301								Qu	Pulao, the only reason I took you all in is to cultivate a suitable vessel. But eventually I realized that none of you... are fit for purpose.	1																					
23	25		301								Qu	Constructs are the intermediate of humans and machines. Half human, half machine. A perfect hybrid, the perfect hotbed.	1																					
24	26		301								Qu	The moment I laid my eyes upon Lucia, I knew she was the one I had been seeking.	1																					
25	27		301								Qu	A pure mind begets an immaculate body, and vise versa. The mind and body wax and wane together. And Lucia is a supreme example of such a synergy.	1																					
26	28		301								Qu	With Lucia as the vessel, Huaxu will become the perfect existence.	1

41	40		301								Qu	Most machines are too weak to accommodate you, and the other Constructs fail to match your beauty. You are perfection itself. That's why I set up the trade fair and spent night after night, looking for a vessel for you.	1																					
42	41		301								Qu	You are my proudest creation, the embodiment of beauty and freedom. Humans are foolish, life-seeking. Machines are clumsy, soulless.	1
