3	3		301									Summer is already coming to an end, but it feels just as hot and humid, like the special phenomenon named "second summer" in some Golden Age text.																						
4	4		301									But such weather should never occur in Babylonia. The truth is, an accidental breakdown of the air conditioning system has brought summer to everybody.

11	11		201							1	1081001	5																						
12	12		301							1	Kamui	Because Capt just turned off the air conditioner in Strike Hawk's preparation room. He said, "we must save energy in such a situation..."	1

14	14		301							1	Karenina	He must be bloody kidding! The Engineering Force's workshop is going over 65°C. Who's going to stay there?!	1																					
15	15		302								So it's the air conditioner, huh...	22	When can they fix it...?	16

17	17		301								Karenina	Huh? I've no idea. Team One went to the central control room with all the heat-insulating equipment. Haven't heard from them since then.	1

23	23		301							1	Kamui	Don't worry about her. Do you have ice-cream here? Do you?	1

47	47		301									It is Ayla, followed by a few Constructs from the WGAA.																						
48	48		301									They are trying to pull a large "box" into the room. It looks like a console.																						
49	49		302								Why are you here?	50	What's this thing?	53																				
50	50		301								Ayla	Ah, I need your help—	1																					
51	51		301								Ayla	The Archaeological Team found this thing, but nobody knew how to crack it. Then I remembered your excellent track record.	1																					
52	52		301								Ayla	—I mean, the funding from "that thing" you helped me with could easily last my research for over two years.	1																					
53	53		301								Ayla	As for this one—	1																					
54	54		301									Ayla points to the thing brought in by the Constructs.																						
55	55		301								Ayla	It's hard to describe in words. Let's just put on VR gear to experience it!	1

87	85		301									A strange power is making you raise your head and look at the other side of the driveway.																						
88	86		301									It does not feel like being manipulated or tempted. You just feel like it is the right thing to do.
