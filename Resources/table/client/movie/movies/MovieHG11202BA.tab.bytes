6	6		302								Thank you.	7	Is it really safe to stay that long in a Corrupted zone?	8																				
7	7	12	301							1	Chrome	Don't mention it.	1																					
8	8		301							1	Chrome	Yep. After my Inver-Device was upgraded, my Mind Beacon became less sensitive than Gray Raven's. In other words, I can operate independently for longer periods of time than other Constructs.	1																					
9	9		302								Sounds impressive.	10	But you still need to be careful.	11

12	12		301							1	Chrome	How's Kamui doing? Still sticking to the plan, I hope?	1																					
13	13		302								He's doing fine.	14	For now, yes.	14																				
14	14		301							1	Chrome	That's good then.	1																					
15	15		301							1	Chrome	...Well, Commandant, I've got some business to take care of.	1																					
16	16		301							1	Chrome	I'll end the connection here then.	1																					
17	17		302								Okay.	18	Stay safe.	18

67	60		301							1	Chrome	...Are you safe right now? Where's Kamui?	1																					
68	61		301							1	Chrome	I'll be there in five minutes. Hold on.	1																					
69	62		302								We're fine.	65	Kamui has dealt with the threat.	67																				
70	63		301							1	Chrome	In a... conventional manner?	1																					
71	64		302								You could say that.	67	Tangentially speaking.	67																				
72	65		301							1	Chrome	Are you sure? As the commandant, you should report the situation as it is.	1

82	75	76	301							1	Chrome	It's for his own good and for the good of Strike Hawk.	1																					
83	76		301							1	Chrome	But since you put it that way, I'll give him the benefit of doubt.	1																					
84	77		301							1	Chrome	I'll admit it. Kamui is good at handling certain situations.	1																					
85	78		302								I agree.	79	You know your team members well.	80																				
86	79	82	301							1	Chrome	Yes, so that I can make the best use of their talent. Given the right command, Kamui can do his job well.	1
