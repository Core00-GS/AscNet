Be Nanami's good human research subject this year too, Commandant!\n\nNa‚òÖna‚òÖmi‚òÖ	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadYongyechao1.png

It's quite lively outside...\nYou must be busy responding to the New Year messages from everyone by now.\nLooking back, we went through a lot in the last year, and I've learnt a lot as well.\nThinking of our times together makes me all warm inside... I'll treasure these memories forever.\nAnd thank you for telling me about past culture, Commandant. Like this New Year.\nWe can still smile and be happy like the people of the past, even in this stricken world of ours.\nIn the past, I would not have realized the importance of the minutest joys, but you and Gray Raven made me realized how priceless they are.\nI will continue fighting alongside you as a proof of my resolve.\nSo, Commandant, please lead us forward in the coming year as well.\n\n*Attached is an obviously handmade lipsticked frog plushie. A small L is sewn on its back.*\n\nLucia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadluxiya1.png

105	1			5	Lee New Year Mail	Lee	Dear Commandant:\n\nAccording to <Babylonia Residential Regulations and Restrictions>, the damage to public facilities and decibel levels caused by Nanami and Karenina last night has clearly exceeded the "agreeably acceptable" standard. Through computational analysis derived from witness statements and database information, there is a high possibility that, Commandant, you, will be deemed as the person in charge.\nAs such, in the following few days, Babylonia Regional Administrations has a 66.3% chance to request from you a statement of responsibility, explanation of circumstances, and other such relevant information. I have already prepared all the possible documents you might require, and you need only sign your name on them. I should note that there is a 1.32% possibility that Babylonia might look into relevant liabilities on the matter. In the case of such a scenario arising, I have prepared a report on possible loopholes, as well as a justifiability analysis on the standards of BRRR and the relevant data to support the analysis.\nI have also repaired the destroyed CIC holo-display last night. Depending on the investigation process, you may abstain from submitting the damage report.\n...On an unrelated note, according to Nanami's testimony and the relevant files in Babylonia's database, I have learned that today is, according to the archaic cultural customs from an Eastern country with a long history and vibrant culture, what the people of that culture call "Lunar New Year".\nIn the past year, we went through countless battles and choices together. Your command decisions have brought us victory and hope.\nYour efforts were not unrecognized by us.\nWell... It all feels quite new and awkward writing it this way.\nBut anyhow, good work for the last year, Commandant.\nHappy New Year.\n\nLee	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1.png
106	1			6	Liv New Year Mail	Liv	Dearest Commandant:\n\nGood morning, Commandant. A new year has come.\nI hope you slept well last night.\nDid you know? There is an Eastern custom in the past known as "Bai Nian". People would gather on New Year's Eve and celebrate the coming of the New Year. They would greet and give each other their blessings, thanking them for their kindness in the last year.\nThis is our first New Year together, Commandant. Karen told me that fireworks can be used to bring good luck, but, fireworks are so transient... which is why I'd like to give you with something more long-lasting...\nI tried making a New Year present for you. It's not much, but it'll please me greatly if you like it.\nThank you for the time we spent together. I'm infinitely grateful that you became Gray Raven's commandant‚Äîour commandant.\nPlease lead us forward in the coming year too.\nHappy New Year\n\nLiv	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png

108	1			8	Bianca New Year Mail	Bianca	Dear Gray Raven's commandant:\n\nI am writing with regards to the Christmas invitation from the Gray Raven squad in the recent past. I have received the invitation, but due to Purifying Force duties concerning the safety of Babylonia officials during the holidays, I could only arrange for Karenina to join you.\nKarenina has expressed that it was a joyous event, and I am sorry for being unable to make it.\nMy shift has just ended, and I hope that this message is not too late for the New Year.\nDue to the nature of the Purifying Force's work, we have always been shunned by others, be it humans or Constructs. It is better for us that way as well. This is also part of the reason why we are usually dispatched during the festivities.\nYet, after knowing more about the Gray Raven and you, I seem to be having a change of hearts on how I feel about the matter... which is a change that I do not dislike.\nTo me, praying is nothing more than a habit, but I still pray, from the bottom of my heart, for your safety in the coming days.\nIf the circumstances permit in the next year, and as an apology for my absence in the Christmas gathering, could I ask you to join me in a short vacation together?\n\nHappy New Year.\nBianca	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadAolisuo1.png
109	1			9	Watanabe New Year Mail	Watanabe	Dear Gray Raven's commandant:\nSorry. I finally found the time to send you a mail. No, I didn't forget about the occasion. Humans might be having their festivals, that's all good and all, but the Corrupted don't get day-offs. If we don't thoroughly clean up the area around the Oasis, it might even mess with your satellites. You probably wouldn't want extra work because of some Forsaken issues too.\nOh, and please keep your squad members in check. When I heard the explosions at night, I thought the Corrupted were knocking on our door. I got my gear and everything ready, only to find your two trouble-making lasses shooting fireworks into the sky. "It looks the best at this angle!" or something, they said...\nI know you might want to spoil them a little as their commandant, but as a leading figure, you might be too lenient on them. You make a mistake, you get disciplined. That's how it should go in the army.\nBabylonia's holidays should be over soon. You must be exhausted from playing hard during the vacation, so you should just rest in the last few days to prepare for work. I'd rather not have to stand in and clean up some new mess for Babylonia once your holidays end. And on an unrelated note, Happy New Year.\n\nP.S. I've attached a red packet for Gray Raven's aid in the previous events.\n\nWatanabe	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadDubian1.png
110	1			10	Alpha New Year Mail	Œ±	*The following is a message forcibly left in Babylonia's Command System*\n\nHeard your human New Year is here, eh? There were explosions and commotion near the settlements yesterday.\nApparently some kind of celebration ritual for a coming year? Even though it isn't 1 Jan.\nReminds me though, before the Golden Age, some Easterners used a slightly different calender, and they based their New Year on that.\n...Humans, humans. How petty.\nDon't even know why you'd celebrate peace with explosions.\nAnd.\n‚Äî‚ÄîGuess I'll be watching you and the Gray Ravens this year too.

111	1			11	Hassen New Year Mail	Hassen	Happy New Year, Commandant. My sincerest thanks to you from Babylonia.\nYour contributions and growth did not go unnoticed. We could not have achieved so much without talented and hardworking individuals like you.\nPlease rest well in this period of time. I'll be looking forward to your performance in the future.\n\nI send to you my deepest regards and thanks through this mail of mine. Every line is written with my truest blessings. Thank you for your effort this year. Let's break the record and keep the torch going next year! I wish for your good health and that everything goes your way.\n\nP.S. This isn't an email template.

112	1			12	Celica New Year Mail	Celica	Dear Gray Raven's commandant:\n\nHappy New Year.\nOn the very first day of the New Year, I had to overtime at the bridge after receiving warnings about explosives. But when I got there, the supposedly broken holo-display was magically fixed.\nAnyway, Babylonia suffered no actual losses, but somehow, I still had to overtime at the bridge. You can imagine how happy I was.\nThe others from Babylonia must have already given you their New Year blessings, right? Don't forget to respond to them.\nOh, but don't take President Hassen's mail too seriously. I even told him not to use early Golden Age styled greetings and such... He's just not with the times, that old man.\nWhen you receive this mail though, your holidays should be about over. Even though the New Year holidays are all about rest and recreation, please don't forget that they are to prepare you for the coming hardships.\nSo don't forget the good times you had in the holiday, and get ready to work hard this year!\nAgain, Commandant, Happy New Year. Babylonia and the World Government is grateful for your hard work and contributions.\n\nFrom Celica at the Babylonia Bridge\nAnd all of Babylonia	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/SailikaNomal01.png

Changyu wasn't messing with me, right?\nAnyway, Jamilah said in her letters that we should greet people important to us in the New Year. Apparently, blessings sent in this period of time are most likely to come true.\nSo, I am hoping that you, Commandant... can be healthy for the coming year.\nJamilah wrote that on her mail to me, so... I know it must be a blessing.\nWhen I asked Jamilah,   "So what happens after the year after?"  \nJamilah replied,   "Then you need only repeat your blessing."  \nSo, the next New Year, I will still be here giving your blessings.\n\nBest,\nSophia 	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png
10001	1			14	Chrome New Year Mail	Chrome	 Dear Gray Raven's Commandant,\n\nI have received news that Kamui has spent an entire night at Gray Raven's recreation room yesterday.\nSince Kamui was on his own in the Strike Hawk base yesterday, coupled with the New Year occasion, I had presumed that he would have more fun over at Gray Raven's, which led to this oversight of mine. He must have caused immense trouble, and I would like to apologize for that.\nWe have completed many missions together with Gray Raven, but due to time constraints, I have not been able to converse with you thoroughly. I have a lot I wish to learn from you, be it squad management, or tactical commanding. So do forgive me for asking you this favor; if you were to have the time, I would like to talk with you more.\nFrom my understanding, a New Year is a potpourri of gratitude to the past, as well as expectations for the future. It is an important event, so please allow me to send you my greetings.\nStrike Hawk has been in your care for the past year. Let us look out for each other in the future as well.I will gladly be waiting for your commands, as always.\nHappy New Year.\n\nChrome 	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadKuluomu1.png

960000031	5		2023/6/15 23:59	1	Lucia's Letter I	Lucia	It's been a while, Commandant... I've only been on this solo mission for a month or so, but I already feel like I've left Gray Raven and you for a long time.\nThe fights on the western front have just died down, and we've kept the enemies miles away from the line of defense. My mission here is over, and I'll be back on Babylonia in a few days.\nThe wait is excruciatingly long. I have so much I want to tell you about‚Äînot just my mission report, but the sights I've seen, the thoughts I've had... and this Activation Date without you.\n...I wish I wasn't alone on this mission. Even when I could do it by myself, I still couldn't help hoping I would somehow find you all with me on the battlefield.\nI wish I could tell Liv about the new flower I found and tell Lee about the analysis results on the anomalies. More than anything, I wish... I could see you sooner...\n...\n...Truth be told... I don't completely comprehend this feeling I have. Wanting to see you isn't something I have to report or discuss with you, after all...\nI just... want to see you.\nWhen the sun rose, I would remember how you pointed at the dawning sun.\nWhen the wind blew, and my blade cut a Corrupted in half, I would remember how you stood fast and held your head up.\nWhen the storm raged, and I saw actual ravens flying in flocks...\nFor some reason, I would think about you.\nI bet it's because I haven't gone on an expedition like this for a while. But don't worry about me. I may be thinking of you, but my blade remains sharp.\nAs I said, my mission here is accomplished. I'll be back soon, Commandant.\nBefore that, please take this souvenir"" I got from this mission‚Äîcall it my Activation Date wish. I wish you had something like this with you, Commandant...\nSomething that will remind you of me.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png
960000032	5		2023/6/15 23:59	2	Lucia's Letter II	Lucia	It's midnight right now. I'm sitting on the edge of a crater so large that a puddle has formed at the bottom.\nOrange-brown mud scatters around it; I think this might be a grass field before. There's even a small coral-colored flower growing in the disturbed soil. I bet Liv would know what it's called if she were here.\nHow I miss my time with Gray Raven and Commandant. Even though this has only been a short mission, I feel like months have passed, and time has slowed.\nHave I been growing dependent? Is that a positive change or a negative one, Commandant?\nBeing apart from you is probably why\nI have so much I want to say. I don't even know where to start, given everything we've been through together.\nThe past I shared with everyone, the moments I spent with you... they all seem to be affecting me in my M.I.N.D. Even now, I still can't shake that blissful sensation.\nSo I decided to record my journey this way and share it with you, Commandant. Letting you see what I've seen makes me feel like you're here, and that's good enough. Does this count as a memory we share?\nTwo birds just flew past me as I was writing this. I didn't have time to catch a clear glimpse before they were already far away.\nI can see the sun rising now.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadR4Luxiya1.png

That's how you people write to each other, isn't it?\nI thought our paths would never cross, Babylonian commandant. We would be two comets getting further and further away after flying past each other by chance once.\nBut even then, you said that sharing whatever time we had as each other's companion was good enough, however brief it was.\nHmph. You probably didn't even think about what your words would mean to me. Still... that's for the best. Traveling is no fun with too much baggage, so... I'll be looking for you.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuxiyaaerfa1SS.png
960000034	5		2023/6/15 23:59	4	Œ±'s Letter II	Œ±	You didn't reply to my last message. Were you busy, or did you not receive it?\nI brought you the key to the motorbike. The key is in a transport craft heading back to Babylonia, and the bike is where your last mission took you.\nWhat? Curious how I knew where your last mission was? I'll tell you when we see each other.\nDon't worry. This trip has nothing to do with where Ascendants and Babylonia stand. I just wanted to go traveling with you for a bit. Just the two of us.\nI don't feel comfortable saying too much here. Things of "unknown origins" are often easily intercepted.\nI'll wait for you here. You have one day.

960000035	5		2023/7/23 23:59	5	Lee's Letter I	Lee	It's been a while since we were last on a mission together. Even though we'd run into each other in the lounge, I feel like I haven't seen you for a long time, Commandant.\nThe adaptation of the specialized frame is going well. It shouldn't be long before I can go on daily operations with you again.\nI saw how damaged your pistol was last time. I happened to have some parts from my old frame, so I thought I'd make you this pistol to use for the time being. "Protector" has a shorter range, so it's for emergencies only; it also comes with a set of 8mm rounds. Still, don't forget to request a new sidearm from the supply office.\n...I'm messaging you so suddenly because I want to see you today. Are you free tonight?\nThis isn't an invitation or anything. I just thought... it'd be more interesting to spend Activation Date with you.\nI'll be at the Babylonia restaurant.\nI'll be waiting.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png
960000036	5		2023/7/23 23:59	6	Lee's Letter II	Lee	Dammit... Shouldn't have trusted anything Kamui gave me... "Alcohol-flavor electrolyte"?\nI didn't send you that invitation. Nothing happened, and I wasn't waiting for you... Never mind.\nRegardless... thank you for coming, Commandant.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLi1SS.png
960000037	5		2023/7/31 23:59	7	Chrome's Letter I	Chrome	Father told me that some of his "people" want to celebrate my Activation Date. He's going to host a banquet at the family house for them.\nFrom what I understand, my specialized frame and the recent battles have made some of the rich and powerful who distanced themselves from Constructs extend an olive branch to the Task Force.\nFather was hoping I'd invite you too.\nAs a Chief and a military hero, your appearance would be incredibly convincing at an event that aims to build bridges.\nI hope you'll attend if you're willing.\nTalking to some of the higher-ups is going to benefit future operations. More importantly, I haven't talked to you unless it's related to a mission or a fight.\nWill you come?\nI've been... missing you.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RolePlayer/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png
960000038	5		2023/7/31 23:59	8	Chrome's Letter II	Chrome	Something happened to Strike Hawk during our mission, so I have to file a report before returning. I'll be about an hour later than we planned.\nIf you're already out, would you mind waiting for me at the house? The banquet is happening in the garden.\nHere is the invitation and the keys I prepared.\nI'll be there to apologize to you in person once I finish the report. Wait for me.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RolePlayer/RoleHeadR3Kuluomu1.png
960000039	5		2023/8/10 23:59	9	Liv's Letter I	Liv	Commandant, it's my Activation Date today.\nProfessor said my condition has been stable lately. It's fine if I go back to the lounge and do my own things.\nSince I've recovered, and everyone is on Babylonia without any urgent mission...\nDo you want to bring Lucia and Lee and spend some time with me?\nI'll prepare tea and cakes. I'm not sure what to make for dinner yet.\nWhat do you want for dinner, Commandant?	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png
960000040	5		2023/8/10 23:59	10	Liv's Letter II	Liv	I'm really happy I could spend Activation Date with everyone.\nI didn't think you would come to help me prepare after I sent you the ingredient list accidentally.\nIf I'm being honest... I was delighted when you walked in, even though I didn't want to be a bother.\nThank you...\nBeing able to walk with you as we get the supplies and prepare the dishes for everyone together made me very happy.\nDo you know that I had a wonderful dream before I woke up?\nIn that dream, I was also walking with you like that, hand in hand...\nIt was because of that dream and the memories of Gray Raven that I could withstand the migraines and the mirages.\nRight... I didn't answer when you asked me what wish I made. The truth is... I didn't make any wishes.\nBecause my wish has already come true.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLifu1.png
960000041	5		2023/8/15 23:59	11	Pulao's Letter I	Pulao	Hello, Commandant! This is Pulao from Kowloong! Long time no see. How have you been... Ahem, that's all the pleasantries Yazi told me to say, I think? I heard that it's your birthday today, Commandant, and people have secretly prepared a celebration on the Nighter! I've planned to set up a small shop to sell the candies I practiced making in secret. That will make me a small fortune... Anyway, this is the finished product. Give it a try, Commandant! But don't lick too hard, or your tongue will stick to it like mine did...	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadPulao1.png
960000042	5		2023/8/15 23:59	12	Pulao's Letter II	Pulao	I'm so sorry I mixed it up...! It's actually my Activation Date today. Thanks for reminding me, Commandant. How embarrassing! So the celebration is for me? No wonder people seem to be avoiding me lately. Honestly, I don't remember much about my past, but I'm surprised you still remember, Commandant... Hehe, that does make me quite happy. Didn't you say people can make a wish on their birthday? Can I also make a wish? Even if it's a little bit greedy? Like asking you to play with me for a whole day... That's not greedy at all? What about... No! That's too embarrassing... Anyway, I'll be waiting for you on the Nighter. I'll tell you my wish then. Pinky promise!	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadPulao1.png
960000043	5	120000	2023/9/27 23:59	13	Ayla's Letter I	Ayla	Hi, Commandant! This is Ayla of the WGAA!\nEarlier, you helped me locate the signals of the "whale song". I finally finished decoding it! I wanted to send you the results right away, but I ultimately decided to wait until today.\nI guess you've figured it out already‚Äîit's Selena's Activation Date today. This was the date Selena decided to become a Construct in order to witness the "truth." I have complicated feelings about this day... but that's a topic for another time.\nWhen I went searching on the surface, I found an amber where the signal of the "whale song" originated, placed in a field in the woods. I think it was left behind by Selena.\nI want to give you the amber today. I don't know why, but I think you should keep it.\nFinally, allow me to use the end of this letter to say something I can't tell her in person this year, either:\nHappy Activation Date, Selena!

960000044	5	120000	2023/9/27 23:59	14	Ayla's Letter II	Ayla	I know not where I am or where I will go.\nThe world cannot be measured by journeys taken. The endless view always remains on the horizon.\n‚ÄîSometimes this makes me melancholic.\nI keep going forward, and the verses slumbering within me cannot be contained:\n"Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow! You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!"\nTake away the feelings that haunt me and the passion that fills my heart.\nPerhaps then I will know where to go.\n...\nI arrived somewhere new again.\nA winding stream cascaded down a green hill. The dark ravine would resound nicely with my cello.\nThe waterfall made a thrumming bass. It made me want to set up my instrument and play music.\nNo audience. No stage. No curtains. No applauds.\nI played until I was tired. The strings hummed until I was bored.\nThe birds brought me an amber in blue when I put away the cello.\nEnveloped inside the resin was a flower I had never seen.\nOnly a moment it took me to place this gem in this field, in this woods.\nThe idea came to my mind in a flash‚Äîa code unspoken but understood.\nI wonder who you will be, kindred spirit, that this stone will find?\nI hope the same beauty graces your journey... as it did mine.

960000045	5	120000	2023/10/3 23:59	15	Sophia's Letter I	Sophia	Dearest Commandant, I hope this letter finds you well.\nThat might be too formal, but Jamilah said you're an important figure, Commandant, so I should do it properly. I asked Changyu to teach me how to write letters correctly.\n(Correction marks) Let's try again. Dearest Commandant, I hope this letter finds you well. Thank you for (more correction marks) your help in the past. It's been a while since what happened. The mood on Akdilek has changed a lot, and my workload as a guard has also increased...\nSorry. I don't know how to express what has happened to us in a letter.\nJamilah said we need to cheer people up. She did some maths and said it is my "Activation Date" today, and it's something to celebrate. She's given me a new coating and hoped that I would do the first dance for a ball to cheer up our unhappy guests and colleagues.\nOn behalf of Akdilek, I am writing to invite you to participate in this ball and admire the reconstruction of Asslam at our temporary base.\nIf possible, I hope you will pay attention to the exhaust recycling system section B. I'm in charge of that. There are many good designs there. It's very admirable.\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nThe address is (correction marks)	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png
960000046	5	120000	2023/10/3 23:59	16	Sophia's Letter II	Sophia	Sorry. I sent the last letter too quickly and forgot to give you our address.\nAs an apology, please accept this maraca. Someone gifted it to me when I worked in Maintenance. I occasionally shook it after I learned how to dance. It made a good sound.\nYes, this is an apology, not a gift. I'm not charging you or trading with you. You just take it.\nIf you can keep it safe, I will pay you a maintenance fee (scratched out) I will repay you with my actions.\nIf I ever dance again, can you shake the maraca during so?\nThe people in Maintenance were very happy when they shook it. You can be happy too. I think.\n\n\nAttached please find the coordinates.\nCome please (scratched out lightly)\nPlease visit.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadSufeiya1.png
960000047	5	120000	2023/10/23 23:59	17	Kamui's Letter I	Kamui	What's up, Commandant? This is the first time I talk to you this way... What's it called again? "Letter"?\nWhatever! It doesn't make any difference. Waiting for your reply is an exciting feeling, though.\nCap told me you require assistance from one person for a mission, so I immediately took the job! I'm pumped just thinking that I can fight alongside you. Pumped!\nOh, the anticipation! It doesn't matter what job it is‚ÄîI always have a good time when I'm with you, Commandant!\nI'll be on my way when you receive this! Time to show you how powerful I am after I leveled up! Hehe, see you soon!	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png
960000048	5	120000	2023/10/23 23:59	18	Kamui's Letter II	Kamui	A surprise for my Activation Date! That was today's "mission"?! I did guess it, a little bit, but I wasn't expecting a surprise like that!\nAnd, and, and! The gift you gave me was something I've wanted for a long time! Someone must have looked through my history. Who was it? Cap? Wanshi? Or... you, Commandant?\nI will never ever forget about today!\nBy the way, have you guys planned something for Camu too? I can't wait to see his expression! Hehe!\nRight, speaking of gifts‚ÄîI have something for you too, Commandant! Although I didn't make it myself, it's a collectible I've had for a long time! Warrior's Greatsword! Isn't it cool!\nI always wanted to find a time to give it to you properly, but the timing never worked out. Well, there's no better time than giving it to you now!\nOn the battlefield, Constructs are warriors, but so are you. As we charge in, you protect us in the back as one of us. That's the thought that gives me the strength to defy the future.\nAhem... It's weird to thank you so formally, but still. Thank you, Commandant.\nNot only for the surprise today. Thank you for protecting this world. Protecting us.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadShenwei1SS.png
960000049	5	120000	2023/10/23 23:59	19	Camu's Letter I	Camu	...\nI knew an event like that was your idea. Although Kamui shares an Activation Date with me, he was surprisingly unmindful about today.\nStill, I had a feeling that he was looking forward to something.\nAhem. I didn't think you'd prepare dishes for the occasion... They might look senseless, but they didn't taste too bad. Much better than what Chrome, Kamui, and Wanshi could make.\nAlso... thank you for the cake. I... don't think I've tasted the sweetness of cream in a long time.\nIt's been a while since we all gathered like that. I suppose it wasn't as annoying as I thought, gathering now and then.\nHave I become soft because of this place? Or is it something else? Somehow, I find this world not as loathsome as before...\nTch. I ordered dinner beforehand, but now that you've messed with my plan, I guess you can take the food instead. Don't thank me.

960000050	5	120000	2023/10/23 23:59	20	Camu's Letter II	Camu	Hey! What are you? Stupid?! Don't just put anything in your mouth!\nYou were lucky I found out just in time! Otherwise, they'd court-martial me for attempted murder on a commandant!\nThe takeaway I gave you... Ahem‚Äîdidn't you guys make food to celebrate my Activation Date? I was looking at it, and I thought, "How hard could it be?"\nWell... the fried rice I made was a little burnt, I'll admit. I was going to throw it away and just get you a takeaway, but I took the wrong box... And why would you think that burnt rice is safe to eat?\nAhem. I bet you still haven't eaten anything with everything that happened. This nightmare-spicy golden egg fried rice and cheese hotteok is from the restaurant in the commercial district. I was going to have them for dinner, so they're safe to eat.\nIs it just me, or does this Activation Date feel like a mess? Still... I guess it's only fitting that the day would be as chaotic as it was.\n...I suppose I have to "make up" for all that trouble, don't I?\nThere's a new restaurant I've been hoping to try. I thought we could give it a go together, so I've booked us a table every day next week. I'll be waiting for you there at dinnertime.\nSee you tomorrow.

960000051	5	120000	2023/10/26 23:59	21	Luna's Letter I	Luna	‚ñÅ‚ñÉ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÉ‚Äî\n...Alpha told me that it is my Activation Date today.\nWhich means I volunteered to forsake my human self, embracing the Ascension-Network on this day many years ago.\nMarking a special day against the current of time is but an excuse humans make for forgetting what it was like. Humans forget their births, but Constructs don't. What happened on the day they became a Construct is forever remembered.\nOn that day, I was greeted by fear, hatred, and betrayal. Then, bullets and blades. I returned the favor afterward.\nThe hate in me has faded over time. All there remains is the cold hard truth they imprinted on me and this world. I know that the path we took meant that we all have blood on our hands. The opportunity to turn back has long passed us... not that we need it anymore.\nUnlike those humans, I won't make excuses for what I've done. To me, those people are all merely specks of dust among the despicable humans.\nBut you... you're different...	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuna1.png
960000052	5	120000	2023/10/26 23:59	22	Luna's Letter II	Luna	Alpha said I should perhaps talk to you before we go.\nWe haven't seen each other after City 075, have we, Gray Raven Commandant?\nAlpha thinks I've become calmer after I left the Moon. Maybe that's because the Ascension-Network has changed. Apart from my wish and my voice, I hear another voice that acknowledges the paradise where I can live with my sister... while also acknowledging the future of humankind.\nThere should be someone like you on the path to the future‚Äîsomeone who is foolish enough to connect with an Ascendant.\nHa. You wouldn't give in even if it cost your life. What a fool.\nBut I suppose that's only human, isn't it?\nYou've demonstrated what it means to be human, so don't lose your life before we create this planet anew, okay?\n...\nI brought this with me when I returned to the surface from the Moon. Alpha already took a few pieces. You can have this one.\nBy the way, you haven't been on the Moon yourself, have you?\nThe Earth surely looks different from there.\nThere was no human speaking, no machine humming, no Punishing Virus interfering. There was only absolute quiet.\nYou should check it out.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadLuna1.png
960000053	5	120000	2023/10/31 23:59	23	Vera's Letter I	Vera	It's my Activation Date today. You do remember it, right?\nThere's not much going on with Cerberus today, and you don't have any mission scheduled too. I checked.\nHow about watching an opera together? I've bought the tickets already. 5:30 in the evening.\nIt's not a very packed show. Maybe you can get me to spill some secrets you've been seeking?\nAnyway. We'll talk when you're there.

960000054	5	120000	2023/10/31 23:59	24	Vera's Letter II	Vera	Door's opened. Where the hell are you?\nSeat 9C and 9D. Enter from the left.\nTaking your time, aren't you? Do you need me to pick you up? You're a Chief. Be disciplined.\nForget it. Just in case‚Äîcall me if something's wrong.\nI'll be waiting here before you do.	Assets/Product/Texture/Image/RoleCharacter/RoleHeadWeila1.png
