10101	Urban Area A							1									
10102	Burning Ruins	The fire on the ruins is still burning even until this moment. We can only pray for the fire to show us some mercy and leave something that we can still use...	1	2				5			101020						
10103	Empty Library	It's more realistic to look for books to burn than food to eat in this place.	1	2				3	10102		101030						
10104	Riverside Camp	There is smoke rising from the stones. Could it be the Corrupted? Or the campfire made by survivors?	3	4				7	10103		101040						
10105	Run-Down Slum	I can hear people crying even from the outside. I'm afraid the situation is worse than we expected... Should we accept them? Or put an end to their misery...?	3	4			1	20	10103		101050						
10106	Crowded Street	There are burns on every car on this crowded street. Apparently, their owners didn't have the chance to drive them out of the city.	1	2				6	10102		101060						
10107	Quiet Bomb Shelter	It's hard to imagine how this bomb shelter has survived everything. However, we could find something we need here...	1	2				11	10106		101070						
10108	Collapsed Skyscraper	The ruins look like the corpse of a giant. No matter what's in there, it will definitely not be pleasant.	3	4			1	14	10107		101080						
10201	Urban Area B							1									
10202	Signal Station	Recently, we have found the signal tower under the ruins. But the huge signal tower now only has a fragile, damaged base left standing in the center of the city.	1	2				6			102020						
10203	High-End Residential Area	Despite the broken columns at the entrance, the delicate architecture still looks amazing. If it hadn't been the disaster, it would have been a dream come true to live there.	1	2				5	10202		102030						
10204	Fine Dining Restaurant	It's said that it was a popular fine dining restaurant, famous for its huge number of underground cold storage rooms and its wide range of food in store.	1	2	3	4		3	10203		102040						
10205	Two-Story House	This small building looks almost intact. It's just that sometimes there are strange cries coming out from it. Are there any Scavengers in there? Or it is another trap?	1	2				20	10203		102050						
10206	Quiet Cabin	There is still a faint light coming out from this clean little cabin, making it stand out among the black ruins around it.	1	2			1	7	10204		102060						
10207	Convenience Store Ruins	It offers fewer choices of items than a supermarket but is enough to fulfill your daily needs.	1	2				19	10206		102070						
10208	Bloody Church	There is blood and unidentified remains everywhere. Wait. Did you hear that? Was it the bells... from up there...?	3	4			1	24	10207		102080						
10209	Supermarket in Mist	Is it because of the terrain? This place is full of mist. Hope we can find the supermarket marked on the map before using up our supplies.	1	2				12	10202		102090						
10210	Collapsed School	The disaster didn't show mercy to this place even though there was the hope of the inheritance of human civilization behind that wall. This is a fact that we learned a long time ago.	1	2				9	10209		102100						
10211	Wasteland	The Punishing Virus broke out before any construction plan was able to be carried out here.	1	2				14	10209		102110						
10212	City Hospital	Were it not for the bold characters on the map, no one would know that this black burnt "pile of dirt" used to be a "hospital."	3	4			1	11	10211		102120						
10213	Rocky Riverbank	The river has long dried out. There is smoke rising from the rocks. Could it be the Corrupted? Or the campfire made by Scavengers?	1	2				4		102130	102130						
10214	Suburban Farm	It seems the farm didn't survive the disaster even though it locates far from the city. Nevertheless, it's still a precious location for us to stay.	1	2				10	10213		102140						
10301	Urban Area C							1									
10302	Traveler's Cabin	This is the only intact building we see walking along the road. We can still see a faint light in it through the window. Could there still be Scavengers in there?	3	4				5			103020						
10303	Roadside Gas Station	Apart from the convenience store that was broken open violently, this roadside gas station still remains how it looked when just abandoned.	3	4				4			103030						
10304	Industrial Park	There is a giant toy statue at the entrance to the park. Half of its face was blown off, leaving only half of its huge smile on the face.	3	4				3	10302		103040						
10305	Abandoned Market	The degree of damage to the market makes me wonder if it was already abandoned before the disaster. Hope we can find something useful in it.	3	4				6	10302		103050						
10306	Abandoned Port	The ships stranded on the shore have formed a natural fortress, making me wonder if there are any remaining supplies or Scavengers in the ship cabins.	1	2				10	10303		103060						
10307	Quiet Bomb Shelter	It's hard to imagine how this bomb shelter has survived everything. However, we could find something we need here.	1	2				13	10303		103070						
10308	Collapsed Mansion	A mansion with astonishing design and size. If it hadn't been the disaster, it would have been the place for most of the "upper class" to hang out on weekends.	1	2				7	10304		103080						
10309	Golden Farm	In the past, the farm was known for its high yield of rice and the golden rice field during harvest. Even now, we can still see the golden light of the farm under the sun from afar.	3	4			1	21	10304		103090						
10310	Armed Dwelling	It's said that there are a group of armed Scavengers with sufficient supplies here... Hope I can negotiate with them and get us some supplies. However, if things go sideways... I think I'd better bring a weapon with me...	3	4			1	16	10306		103100						
10311	Empty Trench	The air is full of the bad smell of burnt bodies. Fortunately, we didn't find any traces of the Corrupted around here. I thought I was already used to the smell of death, but I still feel like throwing up standing here...	1	2				11	10307		103110						
10312	Forest Valley	The ruts full of water stretch all the way into the valley. After observation, we find traces of tents in the woods. Perhaps we can find some Scavengers here.	1	2				18	10307		103120						
10313	Abandoned Mine	The complex structure of the tunnels provides a good shelter for the Scavengers. However, even the thick stone walls can't stop the burnt smell of flesh from coming out. It won't look good in there. Should we still go in there?	1	2				19	10308		103130						
10314	Riverside Camp	It seems the river has dried out a long time ago. The black "corpses" of the burnt trees have created a natural wall for this place, making it hard for us to see what is going on in the camp. Maybe we should take a closer look.	3	4			1	8		103140	103140						
10315	Orchard	This place used to be a productive orchard with rivers full of fish floating through. Now there are only broken, bare, burnt branches... Is it possible to find any supplies or Scavengers here?	3	4				15		103150	103150						
10316	Orchard	This place used to be a productive orchard with rivers full of fish floating through. Now there are only broken, bare, burnt branches... Is it possible to find any supplies or Scavengers here?	3	4				15		103160	103160						
10401	Urban Area D							1									
10402	Empty Trench	The air is full of the bad smell of burnt bodies. Fortunately, we didn't find any traces of the Corrupted around here. I thought I was already used to the smell of death, but I still feel like throwing up standing here...	1	2				5			104020						
10403	Crowded Street	There are burns on every car on this crowded street. Apparently, their owners didn't have the chance to drive them out of the city.	1	2				4			104030						
10404	Camp Amidst Woods	From the outside, the camp seems to be well stocked with supplies. Maybe there are survivors. Even if they don't want to join us, at least we can try if we can get some food or other resources from them.	1	2				3	10402		104040						
10405	Supermarket	Most of the windows have lost their glass. It looks like this place has been bombarded or ransacked by other Scavengers, or both. We can only imagine what the place looked like with the broken sign left here.	3	4				6	10402		104050						
10406	Bloody Church	There is blood and unidentified remains everywhere. Wait. Did you hear that? Was it the bells... from up there...?	1	2				8	10402		104060						
10407	Cabin Amidst Woods	The creaks of the broken door can scare people off even in the broad daylight.	3	4				7	10404		104070						
10408	Quiet Bomb Shelter	It's hard to imagine how this bomb shelter has survived everything. However, we could find something we need here.	3	4			1	21	10404		104080						
10409	Small Fishery	The fishery is just a simple shanty plus some broken fishing nets. We may still find something useful if we are lucky.	3	4				20	10404		104090						
10410	Dilapidated Building	The building is a bit shaky in the winter. Should we still go in there?	3	4			1	12	10405		104100						
10411	Run-Down Slum	I can hear people crying even from the outside. I'm afraid the situation is worse than we expected... Should we accept them? Or put an end to their misery...?	3	4			1	10	10403		104110						
10412	Empty Library	It's more realistic to look for books to burn than food to eat in this place.	3	4				17	10403		104120						
10501	Urban Area E							1									
10502	Overlook Point	We could have a bird's eye view of the city if we reach that spot up there.						5			105020						
10503	Lab Building	The building is like the second landmark of the city. You can see it from anywhere in the city without going to the overlook point. However, there is a strange defensive line before the building. No one is guarding there anymore.						6	10502		105030						
10504	Armed Dwelling	My friends tell me that there are a group of armed Scavengers with sufficient supplies here... Hope I can negotiate with them and get us some supplies. However, if things go sideways... I think I'd better bring a weapon with me...						4	10502		105040						
10505	Radio Station	The radio station is also a mess, but we could find some useful information here.						3	10502		105050						
10506	Strange Opening	There is a big hole in the ground. I can smell gasoline and a fishy odor when standing close to it. When I look into the hole, it looks like a huge bottomless abyss that has been holding the secret behind the destruction of the conservation area.						12	10503		105060						
10507	Quarantine Area	There is a biohazard sign at the entrance to the quarantine area. Everything inside seems to be ruined. Could we find anything useful in a place like this?						20	10503		105070						
10508	Underground Lab	What appears before us is a giant lab. No matter who created this place, that person must be supported by a powerful organization.						14	10506		105080						
10509	Hidden Room	This metal wall in the lab is full of scratches. It sounds weird when we knock on the wall. There must be a hidden space behind it.						11	10508		105090						
10510	Outer City	Behind the lab is a channel leading to the outside of the city. The faint light at the end of the tunnel tells us that the dark night of the city will pass soon.						13	10509		105100						
10511	Residential Area	The density of buildings here suggests that it was a busy area, but now there is only dead silence.						7	10505		105110						
10512	Supermarket in Mist	Is it because of the terrain? This place is full of mist. Hope we can find the supermarket marked on the map before using up our supplies.						8	10511		105120						
20100	Exercise Camp	A small camp set up for the survival exercise. It has reproduced the living environment of the Scavengers on the ground to the maximum extent.					1	1									
20101	Quiet Apartment	Even though most of the paint has come off the walls and revealed the bloody red bricks, the building still remains in good shape. Hope there is something we can use inside it.	1	2				2	20100		2010100						
20102	Camp Amidst Woods	If it were not for the flash of light at night, we wouldn't have found this camp. It's well hidden. In other words, it's a perfect shelter.	1	2			1	3	20101		2010200						
20103	Roadside Gas Station	From the outside, the roadside gas station still looks abandoned. Even the door of the convenience store deep inside is closed. Everything is peaceful and quiet.	4				1	4	20102		2010300						
20104	Wastewater Treatment Plant	This distorted building is the Golden Age wastewater treatment plant marked on the map. However, it is the only building that still looks like a "building" in the area.	1	2			1	5	20103		2010400						
20105	Suburban Quarantine Station	The quarantine station is located far away from the city center, which is probably the reason why it is still in a good state. There are ruts left by survivors outside the station. We could find plenty of useful things if we are lucky.	3	4			1	6	20104		2010500						
20106	Resource Landfill Site	... Compared to the weird Red Tide and the smell of blood, the smell of this landfill site is rather "pleasant". It could hold some useful supplies. A place worth exploring.	2				1	7	20102		2010600						
20107	Empty Trench	We can smell gunpowder even from a distance. Thankfully, we haven't seen any traces of the Corrupted around here. Should we take a look?	1	2	3	4	1	8	20101		2010700						
20108	Battlefield Ruins	One can still see a pile of the remains of the Corrupted in the center of the battlefield even from a distance. In other words, if it is safe enough, it must hold many usable supplies.	1	2				9	20107		2010800						
20109	Community Hospital	There is dim light coming out through the windows. Are the Scavengers who escaped from the forest camp staying here?	1	2	3	4	1	10	20100	20109	2010900						
20110	Suburban Signal Station	The huge signal station only has its damaged base remaining, which looks like a giant's body with its upper half missing. It stands vulnerably and firmly in the wilderness.	1	2			1	11	20109		2011000						
20111	Southern Woods	From the outside, we can see the wet ruts extending deep into the forest. Perhaps we can find some survivors by following the ruts.	1	2			1	12	20110		2011100						
20200	Camp	A temporary camp. The exploration team needs to return to the camp to recycle the resources in the backpack.						1									
20201	Abandoned Postal Station		1	2	3	4	1	2	20200		2020100						
20202	Mountain Village		1	2	3	4	1	3	20200		2020200						
20203	Cableway		1	2				4	20202	20203	2020300						
20204	Relatively Flat Mountain Road		1	2	4			5	20203		2020400						
20205	Mountaintop Viewpoint		1	2	3	4	1	6	20204		2020500						
20206	Cliff Lake						1	7	20205		2020600

20212	Forest Edge		1	2				13	20211	20212	2021210	2021220					
20213	Burnt Forest		1	2	4			14	20212		2021310	2021320					
20214	Dark Path	The forest seems to be boundless as if it's sending... a silent invitation.					1	15	20213		2021410	2021420	2021430				
20215	Hunting Trap		1	2	4		1	16	20214		2021510	2021520	2021530

20219	Old Logging Site		1	2			1	20	20218		2021900						
20300	Camp							7									
20301	Temporary Shelter	This temporary shelter is actually a huge, tattered tent, inside which live many emaciated refugees.	3	4			1	8	20300		203010						
20302	Flat Area	This is a barren land with cement fragments scattered on it.						1	20300		203020						
20303	Abandoned Hospital	An abandoned hospital without electricity. Looking from the outside, the hospital is just as creepy as the typical haunted hospital in the movie.	3	4				13	20300		203030						
20304	Forest Edge	This is a dense forest that the wind could hardly blow through. It's dark deep in the forest. And there seem to be howls of beasts coming from it.	1	2	3	4		9	20301		203040						
20305	Abandoned Gas Station	An abandoned gas station. It's old, but its staff room can still be used as a shelter.	1	2	3	4		2	20302		203050						
20306	Abandoned Road	Long in disrepair, the road is bumpy and covered in bird droppings.						3	20305		203060						
20307	Abandoned Farm	An abandoned farm. Judging from the situation inside it, a family of seven used to live here.						4	20306	20312	203070						
20308	Giant Wheel	A huge mechanical device that gives off a ghostly silver metallic light. Its core is rotating at a tremendous speed with a roaring sound.	1	2			1	5	20307		203080						
20309	Abandoned School	An abandoned school that looks good. A perfect shelter from wind and rain.					1	14	20303		203090						
20400	Camp							3									
20401	Ruins	This place used to be a large amusement park full of the laughter of the children. The war turned this land of happiness into ruins.						18	20400		204010						
20402	Highway 68	A chemical plant was blown up in the war, leaving heavy pollution in the air and water nearby. We have to wear masks to proceed in the toxic mist here.						1	20401		204020						
20403	City Outskirts	There are many supplies scattered around on the ground of the city outskirts. They must be left by people who fled the war in a hurry. Where are they right now?	3	4				23	20406		204030						
20404	City Entrance	Even though the city has gone through the war and is severely damaged, this extravagant building is still standing in the city center. Disgusting.						20	20403		204040						
20405	City Center	It is where everything started. Expose the evil with your hands and end this absurd drama.						21	20404		204050	204052					
20406	Church	A church that was blown up by bombs. It used to be the place where people make prayers. God, will you save humans today?						19	20402		204060						
20407	Dilapidated Building	A building that has gone through the war. It could be a watchtower but is already hard to recognize its original form. The walls are full of bullet holes, revealing some of the steel bars, as if the building is about to collapse at any minute.						2	20400		204070						
20408	Hillside Villa	A small hill with a relatively complete big house on the hillside. It could be the private villa of a rich family. Shhh. It seems there is someone in the villa. Let's get closer.	1	2				9	20407		204080						
20500	Camp	A secondary island located relatively far away from the Hexagon Island.						1									
20502	Smart Gate One	The first gate of the Hexagon Island. It used to be the place where Scavengers' intelligence got tested before the island was sealed off.	1	2	3	4	1	2	20500		2050200	2050206					
20503	Survival Gate Two	The second gate of the Hexagon Island. It used to be the place where Scavengers' survival skills got tested before the island was sealed off.	1	2	3	4		3	20502		2050300	2050304	2050306	2050308			
20504	Strength Gate Three	The third gate of the Hexagon Island. It used to be the place where Scavengers' strength got tested before the island was sealed off.	3	4				4	20503	20504	2050400	2050404	2050406	2050408			
20505	Honor Island	An island of honor for Scavengers who passed all six trials. The towering alloy pillar in the middle is carved with the name of the Hexagon Warriors in the order of time. Will your name appear where the pillar touches the sky?	3	4				5	20503		2050500						
20506	Cultivation Area	The area that produces most of the food for the islanders. It is also where the Scavengers exchange supplies.	3	4			1	6	20503		2050600						
20507	War Gate Four	The fourth gate of the Hexagon Island. It used to be the place where Scavengers' combat capabilities got tested before the island was sealed off.	3	4				7	20504	20507	2050700	2050704	2050706	2050708			
20508	Unnamed Island	An island that is only halfway developed and now surrounded by warning lines. The rusty gate at its entrance is quietly closed.						8	20504		2050800	2050803	2050805

20511	Defense Gate Five	The fifth gate of the Hexagon Island. It used to be the place where Scavengers' defense capabilities got tested before the island was sealed off.	3	4				11	20507	20511	2051100						
20512	Medical Depot	The place where the island distributes serum and heals patients. It is also where Beverly works.	3	4				12	20507		2051200	2051203	2051205				
20513	Residential Area	It is where the islanders live. Hexagon Warriors live in the most luxurious places in this area.	3	4				13	20512		2051300	2051305					
20514	Warehouse	It holds many emergency supplies. Only the island chief can enter.	3	4				14	20512		2051400	2051403					
20515	Residence of the Island Chief	It is where the island chief's family lives and where they meet guests. It's said that among the island chief's family members, there is an outsider who passed the Hexagon trials.	3	4				15	20513		2051500	2051503					
20516	Mechanical Gate Six	The sixth gate of the Hexagon Island. It used to be the place where Scavengers' mastery of various weapons got tested before the island was sealed off.						16	20511	20516	2051600	2051604	2051608				
20517	Shipwreck Point	A luxury ship sank here 3 years ago.						17	20511		2051700						
20518	Fishery	It's a fishery and an open fishing pool. There are many assault boats here.						18	20516		2051800	2051803	2051805				
20600	Camp	A temporary camp. The exploration team needs to return to the camp to recycle the resources in the backpack.					1	1
