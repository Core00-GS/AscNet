1	1001	Beginner Village Leader	Mysterious Enemy	The leader of the Beginner Village seems to be quite tough as the first enemy encountered by Overlord Celica.	Enable Third Eye	Would you like to enable Third Eye?\nJust a little minion of the Beginner Village. You can easily see through <color=#1983c0>all its actions</color>.	I need to keep working on my moves.	Overlord? Meh.

2	1002	Green Dude	Mysterious Enemy	He isn't too smart, but his moves have no pattern, which make them impossible to be countered!	Enable Third Eye	Would you like to enable Third Eye?\nHe seems to really like shouting the names of his moves... Even if you cover your ears, you can still predict <color=#1983c0>2</color> action types.	A battle of strength. I came out on top.	Ha! That felt so good!

3	1003	Passer-by Ascendant	Mysterious Enemy	There's always an ongoing rumor that he is the Ascendant that has suffered the most defeats. Let's make it clear: that isn't a rumor.	Enable Third Eye	Would you like to enable Third Eye?\nHe's an Ascendant, but somehow you really feel for him... Don't go too hard on him, just predict <color=#1983c0>1</color> type of action.	You're used to losing, aren't you?	How could it be?! You didn't lose this time!

4	1004	Purple Guy	Mysterious Enemy	Named after a "mad dog" for his unpredictable moves. A very formidable foe, especially to those who are afraid of dogs.	Enable Third Eye	Would you like to enable Third Eye?\nEven to the Overlord, he feels like an opponent of equal strength... You can only predict <color=#1983c0>1</color> type of action!	Get lost, little puppy!	Is that all you've got? I'm not even warmed up.

5	1005	Origin of Chaos	Mysterious Enemy	A mighty martial artist and the final enemy of Overlord Celica. She is the reason behind all the chaos!	Enable Third Eye	Would you like to enable Third Eye?\nDon't expect to see through her actions, for she has no idea what to expect either.	I am the true Fist of the Overlord!	Come back again!
