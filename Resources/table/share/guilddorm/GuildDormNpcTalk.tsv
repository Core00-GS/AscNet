10101	Commandant, I'm here.	Talk_Idle	1500			About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10102	10105	10108
10102	Summer? I love the warm feeling... But I'll always have this warm feeling as long as I'm with everyone in Gray Raven. What about you, Commandant? Do you feel the same?		1500		10103	About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10102	10105	10108
10103	Feeling hot? Well... I think there are chilled watermelon and cold drinks over there. Liv should also have some things to cool you down. No, I can't do that. You would be frostbitten if I cool you off.		1500		10104	About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10102	10105	10108
10104	Whew... Maybe I can have some ice cream to cool down...		1500			About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10102	10105	10108
10105	There seems to be a grill over there. It's nice to have a barbecue in an outdoor vacation like this, right? But Liv told me to be careful with it... I wonder what she meant...		1500		10106	About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10102	10105	10108
10106	Commandant, not sure if you notice it. The footprints we left when we set foot on this island were washed away by the sea... But the sea will remember them, and so will I.		1500		10107	About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10102	10105	10108
10107	Have you got a plan for our holiday, Commandant?		1500			About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10102	10105	10108
10108	I'll be here for the time being, Commandant.	SummerNpc_Luxiya_Endtalk									
10201	Is there anything I can help with, Commandant?	Talk_Idle	1500			About the Island	About Liv	Goodbye	10202	10205	10208
10202	I had scanned the entire island before we landed. It's completely safe. The only hidden danger on this island is... that grill over there.		1500		10203	About the Island	About Liv	Goodbye	10202	10205	10208
10203	You also noticed the stage, Commandant? There are instruments on it. It's said that they were left for the visitors. Would you like to give them a try?		1500		10204	About the Island	About Liv	Goodbye	10202	10205	10208
10204	This island is warm enough even though it's isolated.		1500			About the Island	About Liv	Goodbye	10202	10205	10208
10205	Me? If I can, I would like to bring a coconut back and see if I can plant it. Not sure what kind of coconut tree it would grow into in the space... No, of course I won't plant it directly in our lounge.		1500		10206	About the Island	About Liv	Goodbye	10202	10205	10208
10206	I feel... secure. The wind, the sunshine, and the warm sand will always make me feel relaxed... Do you feel the same, Commandant?		1500		10207	About the Island	About Liv	Goodbye	10202	10205	10208
10207	I'll remember this holiday we spend together, Commandant.		1500			About the Island	About Liv	Goodbye	10202	10205	10208
10208	Goodbye, Commandant. I'll always be here.	SummerNpc_Lifu_Endtalk									
10301	Hi, Commandant.	Talk_Idle	1500			About Summer	About the Sea	Goodbye	10302	10305	10308
10302	In my memory, summer is always full of suffocating dust or a rain that won't stop for dozens of days. It's never this clear and bright. And most importantly, it's comfortable here.		1500		10303	About Summer	About the Sea	Goodbye	10302	10305	10308
10303	Have you watched the Summer Brawl before? It is an anime from the Golden Age. I think it's a perfect fit for this happy and relaxing time.		1500		10304	About Summer	About the Sea	Goodbye	10302	10305	10308
10304	I'm already very happy to be able to pass a peaceful summer.		1500			About Summer	About the Sea	Goodbye	10302	10305	10308
10305	Look! Is that a seagull? I only saw its illustration before, but I can still recognize it just like that. It must be wonderful to fly freely between the sky and the sea... This is, of course, one of my wishes as well.		1500		10306	About Summer	About the Sea	Goodbye	10302	10305	10308
10306	I actually had a horrible first impression on the sea, but now I finally get the chance to look at it quietly... What's on the other side of the sea?		1500		10307	About Summer	About the Sea	Goodbye	10302	10305	10308
10307	Go and have a look. What you see is what I want to see.		1500			About Summer	About the Sea	Goodbye	10302	10305	10308
10308	Goodbye, Commandant.	SummerNpc_Nuoan_Endtalk									
10401	Hmm... What's up, Commandant?	Talk_Idle	1500			About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10402	10405	10408
10402	Spring, summer, fall, and winter are all good seasons to take a sleep... Hmm? You feel the same?		1500		10403	About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10402	10405	10408
10403	Do you like this season? It is a sleepy season... Hmm? No, I don't want to go anywhere else. It's comfortable here. You go for me...		1500		10404	About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10402	10405	10408
10404	At least we have some great sunshine here, right?		1500			About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10402	10405	10408
10405	I checked the coastline, but today is the first time that I get to relax like this... What? We are on holiday? Then let me take a nap first...		1500		10406	About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10402	10405	10408
10406	Speaking of which, the beach chair is perfect to nap on, especially in the sea wind... Do you want to give it a go?		1500		10407	About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10402	10405	10408
10407	Hmm, Kamui has been asking me to play with him in the sea... What? You haven't seen him? Thank God...		1500			About Summer	About the Island	Goodbye	10402	10405	10408
10408	Good night... No, see you.	SummerNpc_Wanshi_Endtalk									
10501	Hello, Commandant.	Talk_Idle	1500			About the Sea	About Bianca	Goodbye	10502	10505	10508
10502	In my memory, the sea means more dangerous missions, but faith and purpose are like the rocks. They are unshakable...		1500		10503	About the Sea	About Bianca	Goodbye	10502	10505	10508
10503	How do you feel about the sea? It won't stay calm like this forever. It can be turbulent and terrifying... But will you still feel the same way you do when it's like that?		1500		10504	About the Sea	About Bianca	Goodbye	10502	10505	10508
10504	I miss the sea so bad.		1500			About the Sea	About Bianca	Goodbye	10502	10505	10508
10505	About the frames... Do you mind it? They are part of me, but I prefer to spend my holiday in a more relaxing way.		1500		10506	About the Sea	About Bianca	Goodbye	10502	10505	10508
10506	For the Purifying Force, the brief moment of standby is our holiday... What about the Task Force? You don't have much time off, do you? Commandant?		1500		10507	About the Sea	About Bianca	Goodbye	10502	10505	10508
10507	I'll be here watching, Commandant. Both the sea and you.		1500			About the Sea	About Bianca	Goodbye	10502	10505	10508
10508	See ya, Commandant.	SummerNpc_Bianka_Endtalk									
10601	Hey! Commandant! Nice to see you again!	Talk_Idle	1500			About Snacks	About the Sea	Goodbye	10602	10605	10608
10602	Commandant! There! Did you see the snack stand over there? Yeah, that thing called hamburger... Oh, it's fast food, right? It smells so good... I wonder how it tastes.		1500		10603	About Snacks	About the Sea	Goodbye	10602	10605	10608
10603	Kowloong has so many delicious foods in summer! The sweet soup, the bean jelly, the fruits, and the ice bowl. I've heard of the ice bowl, but I never had the chance to try it...		1500		10604	About Snacks	About the Sea	Goodbye	10602	10605	10608
10604	I've got to take you to try Kowloong's summer snacks if we have the time!		1500			About Snacks	About the Sea	Goodbye	10602	10605	10608
10605	I remember seeing the sea on the Nighter every day. Or the sea was all that I could see... Sounds confusing, doesn't it? Anyways, I love the sea here!		1500		10606	About Snacks	About the Sea	Goodbye	10602	10605	10608
10606	By the way, the stars in the night at sea are different from what we see in Babylonia. You haven't seen it before, right? Commandant? Let's look at the stars together at night!		1500		10607	About Snacks	About the Sea	Goodbye	10602	10605	10608
10607	Commandant, promise you'll take me when you go to the sea.		1500			About Snacks	About the Sea	Goodbye	10602	10605	10608
10608	Bye, Commandant.	SummerNpc_Pulao_Endtalk									
10701	Ha! There you are.	Talk_Idle	1500			About the Island	About Summer	Goodbye	10702	10705	10708
10702	My experience tells me that there are a few Corrupted hidden in that beach over there. And I wouldn't be surprised if some Ascendants suddenly come down from the sky... Yeah, that look. You don't need to suppress your nervousness. It's okay. I understand.		1500		10703	About the Island	About Summer	Goodbye	10702	10705	10708
10703	Commandant, get me a cold drink over there. You can get yourself one too. But don't get the wrong one. For the record, I have no experience in rescuing people who drink the cooling liquid by mistake.		1500		10704	About the Island	About Summer	Goodbye	10702	10705	10708
10704	The island is perfect for holiday. Plus, it's not boring here.		1500			About the Island	About Summer	Goodbye	10702	10705	10708
10705	When was the last time when the sea, the summer, and you were together? You should remember, right? Well... You'd better remember.		1500		10706	About the Island	About Summer	Goodbye	10702	10705	10708
10706	Sometimes I wonder if we should change our clothes, or coatings, according to the season. After all, summer is not a calm season, right?		1500		10707	About the Island	About Summer	Goodbye	10702	10705	10708
10707	You'll have to make some sacrifice if you want to share this shade with me... Think about it.		1500			About the Island	About Summer	Goodbye	10702	10705	10708
10708	Hmm? Are you leaving already?	SummerNpc_Weila_Endtalk									
10801	Hello, Conductor.	Talk_Idle	1500			About the Island	About the Stage	Goodbye	10802	10805	10808
10802	Only the smell of the sea can bring our souls back. I think you can feel it too, right? Conductor? The wind comes from the sea...		1500		10803	About the Island	About the Stage	Goodbye	10802	10805	10808
10803	Maybe we will only remember the summer we spent together when the horrible storm has passed and the sun casts its light on the ground.		1500		10804	About the Island	About the Stage	Goodbye	10802	10805	10808
10804	The storm has passed, so we can enjoy the sunshine on the island.		1500			About the Island	About the Stage	Goodbye	10802	10805	10808
10805	Yes, of course, we've all been on the stage and off the stage. I just miss this feeling. But these instruments... feel so strange.		1500		10806	About the Island	About the Stage	Goodbye	10802	10805	10808
10806	Would you like to hear something? Maybe I can play something for you. But most of the ball music can't be performed by one person... Would you like to join me, Conductor?		1500		10807	About the Island	About the Stage	Goodbye	10802	10805	10808
10807	A stage that I can't hide from. A stage that makes me stay.		1500			About the Island	About the Stage	Goodbye	10802	10805	10808
10808	Until then, Conductor.	SummerNpc_Sailinna_Endtalk									
10901	Hello, Commandant. Is there anything I can help with?	Talk_Idle	1500			About the Holiday	About Chrome	Goodbye	10902	10905	10908
10902	Speaking of which, we haven't made time to have some rest for a long time. "Rest and rejuvenate is also a tactic." I remember that's what the instructors told us in F.O.S.		1500		10903	About the Holiday	About Chrome	Goodbye	10902	10905	10908
10903	If the holiday lasts forever, then I'm afraid it will become just like work, right? This is exactly why this holiday is so precious.		1500		10904	About the Holiday	About Chrome	Goodbye	10902	10905	10908
10904	I'll be around anytime if you want some rest.		1500			About the Holiday	About Chrome	Goodbye	10902	10905	10908

10906	...Oh, sorry, I was lost in thought. I didn't notice that you were calling me. Sometimes I would empty my mind like this when I have the time. It's a good way to relax. You should try, Commandant.		1500		10907	About the Holiday	About Chrome	Goodbye	10902	10905	10908
10907	Planning holidays for you and yourself is part of your duty as a commandant and captain.		1500			About the Holiday	About Chrome	Goodbye	10902	10905	10908

11003	...I'm good, sitting here and enjoying the sea wind. If you want some food, there seem to be some snacks over there, but I'm not sure how it tastes.		1500		11004	About the Island	About Lee	Goodbye	11002	11005	11008
11004	I'm curious about where the stage gets its power. I bet it's not some mysterious summer power...		1500			About the Island	About Lee	Goodbye	11002	11005	11008
11005	Me? For me, it's not whether I like it or not. It's just that I feel calm staring at the sea. And it's a good time killer as well.		1500		11006	About the Island	About Lee	Goodbye	11002	11005	11008
11006	You are so strange. It's your holiday, but you're worrying about other people... I know. I'm fine. I can be better if you want.		1500		11007	About the Island	About Lee	Goodbye	11002	11005	11008
11007	You can take this holiday as our holiday, because that is what I think.		1500			About the Island	About Lee	Goodbye	11002	11005	11008
